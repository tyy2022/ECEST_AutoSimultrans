Full compliance with all the provisions of the Treaty, including with relevant safeguards agreements, remains fundamentally important to its integrity. Cities, as economic and productive innovation spaces, provide opportunities for improving access to resources and services, as well as options in the social, legal, economic, cultural and environmental fields. Participants also made a commitment to taking action, as a matter of urgency, collectively and individually, to bring the benefits of sustainable urban development to all. Having studied the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action of 1995, particularly the recommendation relating to gender equality and the empowerment of women, Women in Alternative Action notes that, 20 years after the adoption of the Platform for Action, encouraging progress has been made in implementing that recommendation and many African countries are performing very well, notably in two areas: It was the culmination of a series of regional nuclear-free-zone proposals and initiatives dating back to the early 1960s, which were borne of the region's harsh experience with nuclear testing in the Pacific and the Forum members' concern about the arms race and the risk of nuclear war. 1. The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of Rarotonga) entered into force on 11 December 1986, becoming the second treaty in the world to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in a populated region (the first being the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, or the Treaty of Tlatelolco).

In that regard, the Group calls upon those States to strictly refrain from conducting any type of nuclear tests for the modernization, development or further improvement of nuclear weapons.

The Group of Non-Aligned States Parties to the Treaty stresses that the granting of such assurances by all five nuclear-weapon States parties to all nonnuclear-weapon States parties is a commitment, the fulfilment of which provides an essential security benefit to the States parties to the Treaty and is necessary to strengthen the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and its credibility.
