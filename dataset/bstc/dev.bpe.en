good E@@ vening , everyone .
I don &apos;t know if you know this person .
he is a very famous speaker in Australia , Nick .
he has no limbs , and he likes to tease his only little leg very much .
he calls it drum@@ stick .
in fact , it is very difficult for us to imagine or understand how he lives .
first thought that came to me was how could he manage to survive ?
how can he live with such a very good and optimistic state of mind and state of life ?
it turns out he is living very well now .
he is making speeches everywhere .
he not only recognizes and believes in himself , he also brings his confidence to everyone who listens to his speeches .
many people were moved and cried when they heard what he said , and finally they would look back at themselves : am I saying yes to myself ?
am I confident in myself ?
even a disabled person with no limbs like him , though physically handicapped , still has such a perfect character and perfect spirit .
so what should we do ?
what kind of affirmation should we have for ourselves ?
I especially admire a disabled athlete when I was an athlete .
I used to be a wheelchair f@@ encer .
once I met an American boy in a contest who was in a wheelchair , too , his grade was B .
the so @-@ called Class A and Class B refer to two grades for athlete &apos;s conditions in wheelchair fencing .
grade A are those like me , with a functional lumbar spine that can move back and forth , because wheelchair fencing is fixed .
so what is Grade B ?
grade B are those with lumbar paralysis who have no senses below the waist .
but this athlete of Grade B has very , very serious conditions among the Grade B f@@ enc@@ ers I have seen .
why ?
except for his lumbar paralysis , he even loses the three fingers of his hand holding the sword .
do you know how he held the sword ?
he managed to sit in the wheelchair for competi@@ ton with the help of others .
after he sat in the wheelchair , he had his hand to hold the sword tied to his own hand band@@ ages on a glove , and then he would stab the other side very hard .
however , I can always see him in every World Cup and championship .
he has always been ranked among the last , so to speak , the last in those games .
what kind of spirit supported him to take part in the competition all the time ?
you know , everyone is afraid of losing , right ?
everyone does not want to lose ; rather , they all want to win .
when he lost every match or even came in the second last or last place , what was it or what kind of strength supported him to compete and train all the time ?
later it occurred to me that he must like this sport .
he loves this sport .
so he enjoys it even if he loses .
it is the kind of person who makes me feel I can do everything .
with that , what is the limit of human beings ?
many of our functions have deteriorated , but in fact , human beings are the animals that can adapt to the environment best .
why ?
although I have one leg , I have never thought I would have any problem surviving in this society since I just have my leg am@@ put@@ ated .
I think that I can survive no matter what .
my job may not be particularly good , but I think I can find a job , which is my reason of confidence .
many people say that I am not able to do it .
in fact , it &apos;s not that you can &apos;t do it .
not really .
it &apos;s just that you haven &apos;t come to the moment .
to survive in this environment , one can always find various ways to adapt oneself to it .
then when you have one leg , you must survive as always , so I learned to jump when I just started to be one @-@ leg .
later , when I got my cr@@ utch for the first time , I said to myself in the mind : &quot; wow ! this pair of cr@@ ut@@ ches feels just like the cr@@ ut@@ ches I should have been born with . how can I walk so freely ? &quot;
until now , many people still ask me , &quot; Jin Jing , why don &apos;t you put on artificial limbs ? &quot;
&quot; how beautiful your legs look with artificial limbs , &quot; They would say .
why don &apos;t I use artificial limbs ?
first , I can &apos;t wear high @-@ he@@ eled shoes when wearing artificial limbs .
I still like wearing them .
girls look very tall and straight when wearing high @-@ heels .
second , wearing artificial limbs is really not as convenient as people think .
I am a practical type .
I wouldn &apos;t force myself into a beautiful look , which turns out to affect my normal life .
so why do I need a pros@@ thetic leg ?
just to be good @-@ looking ?
in the eyes of other people ?
I would say I am also pretty good @-@ looking this way , what do you say ?
so sometimes I think it is very , very important for me to affirm myself and be confident in myself .
by the terms used by athletes , the process of torch relay is like a process from individual competition to team competition .
because when I came down from the coach for torch carriers , I found that many people around me were hostile , un@@ friendly protesters who even tried to grab the torch from me .
at that time , I thought , oh , why would they be like this ?
why would such a thing happen ?
out of an athlete &apos;s instinct , I would feel so angry , because it happened to be the 2008 Beijing Olympics , the Olympics in our own country .
later , it wan &apos;t until later when our Chinese overseas students come to join this team that I found : wow , actually I am not alone .
it turns out I have such a huge force behind me .
if you are really sure about yourself , about all the decisions you have made , or the things you have done , then on what ground will you refuse to believe in our people , in us , and in our country &apos;s future destined to be better ?
we really , really hope that besides giving a little confidence , a little recognition to ourselves and all our close friends , our country , our motherland can also give more people a little recognition and a little confidence .
thank you .
hello , everyone !
welcome to the advanced course on the UN@@ IT dialogue system .
I &apos;m Sun Shu@@ qi , an R &amp; D engineer for UN@@ IT .
in this lesson , we will learn how to evaluate the performance of a dialogue system .
performance evaluations mainly serve two purposes .
let &apos;s look at the first one , online performance tracking .
for online performance tracking , we first need to extract some business logs regularly , then evaluate its precision and recall manually .
how do we extract the logs ?
we must emphasize not to delete the duplicate samples in the actual online logs .
this is very important , because the duplicate samples will reflect the actual distribution of problems .
the sample size should be between 100 and 200 .
we can then create an evaluation set in which we will calculate two indexes : precision and recall .
some developers may be confused when they first see these two indexes , wondering how to calculate them .
to make it easier to understand , I have made a diagram here .
the orange circle represents the queries that have been par@@ sed successfully by the system , and the blue circle represents those queries which we expect to be par@@ sed successfully .
the B circle is where they inter@@ sect , representing the queries that have been par@@ sed successfully and accurately by the system .
so , the precision formula is cac@@ ulated by B รท ( A + B ) , which shows the ratio of accurately @-@ identified queries to all those identified by the system .
this is what precision refers to .
B รท ( B + C ) is dividing the number of accurately identified queries by the number of those expected to be identified .
this is what recall refers to .
in addition to these two indexes , we also need to pay attention to some key and specific cases .
for example , if the int@@ ents are par@@ sed un@@ successfully or in@@ accurately , and the slots are not identified , it could be because some utter@@ ances that we did not prepared during the configuration phase have been encountered , or because slot values which are not covered in the system dictionary and custom dictionary have appeared .
this is how we should address this kind of situation - add new templates and label some samples , supplement the custom dictionary with the missing slot values .
in the second case , when slots are not accurately identified or norm@@ alized , it is likely that there are bad cases in the system slot dictionary , or that some entries in the user slot dictionary have multiple possible meanings , or that the user slot dictionary covers all entries of the system one .
the solution is to submit feedback to UN@@ IT and urge us to develop and update the system slot dictionary .
users can also adjust their templates and dictionaries on their own .
one tip - a small number of cases can be resolved just by labeling samples .
the third one is that some new requests cannot be met .
for example , in a map scenario , we have often found that people not only ask for directions and locations , but also ask for music to be played .
this is actually very interesting .
we would have to analyze whether this new request should be supported or not .
if so , then we would need to add new skills .
otherwise , we need to guide the users by telling them that this function is not supported .
in doing so , lower their expectations .
in short , regular evaluations are very important .
we need to quickly discover problems and new requests so as to keep improving the performance of the dialogue system .
the second one is policy iteration .
what is policy iteration ?
at first , we have a model X .
then , we optimize the model and change it to a new model , Y .
what should we do before we replace the online model X with Y ?
at this time , we can use the evaluation method I just mentioned , that is , we evaluate the precision and recall .
if Y scores higher than X on precision and recall , then Y is indeed better .
but is this enough ?
I don &apos;t think so .
we also need to perform some comparative evaluations to see the di@@ ff ratio and G@@ S@@ B .
let &apos;s look at what di@@ ff ratio and G@@ S@@ B are .
to evaluate on these two indexes , we first need to create a data set , that is , we first use two models , X and Y , to par@@ se the same data log and see if they generate different results with regard to the same query .
if they do , we will collect the results and create an observation set .
then , to get di@@ ff ratio , we can divide the size of the observation set by that of the log .
in fact , di@@ ff ratio essentially reflects the percentage of queries for which the two models generate different results .
it is very important , because it represents the degree of change in user experience when Y is released .
by observing all the different results we can see whether Y is better than X or vice versa for each individual query , or whether they perform similarly despite having different results .
every case is rated in three levels : good , same and bad .
G : s : B refers to the ratio of &quot; good &quot; cases to &quot; same &quot; cases to &quot; bad &quot; cases .
in this way , the result is very clear .
for Y to replace X , there should be more G cases than B cases .
this is the only way to prove that Y is better than X .
we should also take note if the di@@ ff ratio is too high .
as a rule of thumb , if the di@@ ff ratio is higher than 10 % , then things become tricky , because it entails a relatively significant change in user experience .
we need to consider whether this significant change in user experience needs to be addressed .
OK , that &apos;s all for this lesson .
thank you !
good evening , everyone .
I am Liao Z@@ ile from Shanghai World Foreign Language Academy .
my grades are neither poor nor good , and I &apos;m definitely not a well @-@ behaved kid in the traditional sense .
but I have a special hobby : fid@@ dling with robots .
so my friends like to call me &quot; Mac the Rob@@ ot . &quot;
since my 3rd year in primary school I &apos;ve been touring around with my coach , as well as my robot friends , through all kinds of robot competitions across the world and have won some prizes .
last year , I won the second prize in the World Educational Rob@@ ot Con@@ test hosted by Tr@@ inity College .
this year , I won another second prize in the World Educational Rob@@ ot Con@@ test staged in US .
always the second prize . maybe that word &quot; two &quot; just loves me ( &quot; Two &quot; also means &quot; silly &quot; in Chinese ) .
you might at first take me as a cute , good and polite boy .
indeed , if you stay with me for five minutes , there is a good chance that you might ex@@ claim , &quot; What a good boy ! &quot;
if the five minutes extend to five hours , I bet your previous good opinion of me will be over@@ thrown .
&quot; this boy is a nuisance , &quot; you might say .
if the time you spend with me is further leng@@ th@@ ened to five days , I &apos;m sure you will finally conclude , &quot; well , this is actually a problem kid . &quot;
alas , why is it so ?
because I don &apos;t quite listen to what adults say .
precisely speaking , I listen to them 65 % of the time .
the other 35 % of the time I just follow my own ideas .
but you adults obviously don &apos;t like that .
that means I always live a miserable life .
being scol@@ ded has become such a routine for me that it seems as if the day never daw@@ ns nor dark@@ ens without me being repri@@ man@@ ded .
the most frequent advice for me is , &quot; Can you just listen to me ? &quot;
but the problem is , I do listen .
only that I listen selectively , and I keep my independence 35 % of the time .
since my 3rd year in primary school I &apos;ve been thinking , &quot; Must I fully yield to adults ?
can I at least have some say in my own life ?
as my contemplation deep@@ ens , I come to realize that adults have their own world , and children should also construct a world that belongs only to them .
I &apos;ve also found something disturbing in adults along the way .
here I &apos;ll give you some examples .
the first thing is , I find adults , like running wheels , tend to put endless demands on children .
take me for example .
when I was in 5th grade in primary school , my dad repeatedly warned me , &quot; You must get the direct , exam @-@ exempted access to the junior high school . or else you will be doomed . &quot;
so I kept working hard , until finally I secured a place at the junior high school in the second semester of the 5th grade .
time to relax , I told myself .
but my dad posed yet another challenge , &quot; You must also get a place in the elite class of the junior high school , or else you still have little chance to win . &quot;
poor me .
I had to start yet another round of tough study .
my labor was rewarded and finally I was given a place in the elite class .
my dad , however , was still not satisfied .
school began , and I sc@@ am@@ pered around to pack up my things .
then my dad said , &quot; You have to make it into the top 15 of the class . it should not be so hard . I believe you can do that . &quot;
but dad , you should know that the elite class usually gathers the best of the best students .
how can I have a chance to squeeze into the top 15 ?
I can imagine that , when I graduate from the junior high school , my dad will definitely say to me , &quot; You must get into the top four high schools . &quot;
after that , when I end my high school life , he will again push me , &quot; You must go to the top @-@ rated universities . &quot;
things are just like that . you adults are always putting demands on children , and there is no end to your demands .
as far as I know , such things also happen to my classmates .
those hopes of yours , I should say , are actually your own un@@ fulfilled dreams that you impose upon us .
but I think we children should also have our own dreams .
the second thing I &apos;ve found is that you adults seem very reluctant to admit your own mistakes .
you agree with me on this ?
I used to be a frequent visitor at the Xinhua Book@@ store , reading or buying books there , when I was in 5th grade of primary school .
I still remember two scenes I saw there .
in the first scene , a mother , after feeding water to her child from a cup , put the cup on the ground , but the lid wasn &apos;t fastened tightly on the cup .
when the child turned around to pick books , he accidentally tro@@ d on and kicked over the cup .
so what would you do if you were this mother ?
I bet you would be furious and give the child a good scol@@ ding .
and so the mother did .
but I just want to say , would this accident still have happened if the lid of the cup had been firmly fastened in the first place ?
the second scene was about a father who led his child to pick books .
the child drank some water from a cup , and again , leaving the cup loosely covered .
then the cup was kicked over by the father by accident .
and the father , again , like the mother in the first scene , show@@ ered the child with scol@@ ding .
&quot; why didn &apos;t you screw the lid tight ? &quot; he snapped , &quot; If you had done that , nothing would have happened . &quot;
well , now this , now that , I just don &apos;t understand , why is everything the children &apos;s fault ?
the third thing I notice is that adults are strict with children , but are len@@ ient with themselves .
for example , playing digital games is what we children naturally like , but adults , either teachers or parents , keep saying that digital games are bad , will disrupt study and lead to poor grades .
so we are only permitted to use digital products without any gaming functions .
even the electronic dictionary we use is stripped of all games , however un@@ threatening they are , like Sn@@ ake , so as to make sure the dictionary is safe .
but just look around , there are adults everywhere with eyes glued to their cell phone , whether at dinner , or during a meeting , or on the subway , or driving a car .
I can even see from here that some of you are using your cell phone right now .
the irre@@ fut@@ able reason adults give us for all this injustice is : because we are adults , we can use cell phones .
and because you are children , you just can &apos;t .
what a logic !
the fourth thing I find is that adults sometimes are even slower to forgive than children .
for example , a naughty boy like me might easily invite scol@@ ding , and sometimes I might have issues with my classmates .
but generally no matter whether I am un@@ fairly treated , I just learn to endure .
sometimes unhappy things happen between me and my friends , but we soon make up .
the worst enemy fighting me in the morning can become my intimate buddy again in the afternoon .
but look at you adults , how often you hold a lifelong grudge !
and you even fabric@@ ate a phrase for your act : it is never too late for revenge .
so I am thinking , if one day we have to grow into adults like you who always let unhappy things weigh on the mind , then what &apos;s the point of our growing up ?
it is because of those things I &apos;ve found about you adults that I choose to keep your advice at arm &apos;s length .
I believe , 65 % of the time , what you say is absolutely right and I must accept it for my own good .
but for the other 35 % of the time , I want to be my own master .
with the 35 % , I will have my own world , and with the 65 % I can stand on the shoulders of giants before me .
I can achieve more and have my own future .
thank you !
developers , entrepreneurs and friends , good afternoon !
it is an honor for me to welcome all of you to attend the ceremony !
today is the last day of our 20@@ 17 Baidu AI Develop@@ er Camp , and the open@@ ning day of our Baidu AI Acc@@ eler@@ ator .
we all know that AI is now very popular , but what does AI mean to us actually ?
all of us know this saying , &quot; Science and technology constitute a primary productive force . &quot;
over the past 200 years , mankind has already gone through three industrial rev@@ olutions , each of which has greatly increased the productivity through injecting the power of technology into every aspect of our production and daily life .
now we are undergoing the fourth industrial revolution .
so what is the key technology this time ?
artificial intelligence , of course .
AI will not only improve the efficiency of existing industries , but also bring about a lot of new products and new industries .
in this process , although this time the booming of AI is largely due to the Internet industry that possesses an enormous amount of data , very strong computing capability and computational platforms , and many advanced algorithms .
but the impact of AI is far beyond the Internet .
it will definitely affect all kinds of industries and the life of people in all aspects , bringing productivity increase .
and productivity increase , in return , will eventually affect the production relations .
most of us might have learned this when we were in school .
economic base will eventually determine our super@@ structure .
in other words , along with its growth , little by little , AI will bring profound impacts on everyone of us and on the whole society .
Baidu started search engine service nearly 18 years ago .
at the beginning , we would say search engine is naturally an AI product , so from the very beginning of our search engine development , Baidu has been working on some AI technologies , for example , N@@ LP technologies .
and seven or eight years ago , Baidu started setting a full layout for AI .
for example , N@@ LP , speech , image , machine learning , knowledge graph , big data and etc. were started in Baidu at that time .
now we have got a rather complete layout , from the most basic layer to the perception layer , which covers speech , image , vision , video , AR , V@@ R ๏ผ to the cognition level , including N@@ LP , K@@ G and user portrait .
more importantly , based on these technologies , we have established a complete platform and ecosystem , which are closely related to every developer and entrepreneur here .
as the host mentioned just now , since October our Baidu AI Develop@@ er Camp has been held in many cities .
today it returns to Beijing and comes to an end .
of course , its end in this year does not mean it is over .
I believe that more and more developers will achieve their success in our camp next year .
in addition to the Camp , in addition to the AI capacities we offered to AI @-@ related developers and entrepreneurs , we also hope we could provide comprehensive support , in terms of partnerships , market channels and funds .
that &apos;s why we have this AI Acc@@ eler@@ ator that opens today .
we expect that our Practice Camp can help the participants to improve their business skills through practices and exercises , and we wish that our AI Acc@@ eler@@ ator could provide a much more comprehensive support for all of you .
before I left the company for the conference , I got an e @-@ mail .
many of you may know that we held the 20@@ 17 Baidu World Conference on November 16th , opening many new capabilities such as AR .
now , half a month has passed .
the e @-@ mail forwarded by a colleague of mine , said that after the opening of the capabilities , a developer soon has published his self @-@ developed product based on these capabilities .
during the period from November 16th to today , the product has been sold in market and won orders .
and this is just one example I &apos;ve heard .
I believe that some of you here may have similar experience .
I hope that Baidu can provide more support for you and we will succeed together !
the success of all developers and partners is the success of Baidu AI , and also the success of Baidu .
let us contribute our share to achieve a better future for our society and our life !
thank you !
hello everyone !
welcome to the advanced course on the UN@@ IT dialogue system .
I am Sun Shu@@ qi , an R &amp; D engineer for the Baidu UN@@ IT platform .
in this course , I will introduce to you the UN@@ IT dialogue management .
dialogue management is aimed at dealing with businesses or things that cannot be fully said or done in one sentence .
there are three major tasks in dialogue management .
firstly , the information mentioned in previous sessions have to be remembered .
secondly , the missing key information have to be clarified .
thirdly , specific dialogue branches should be triggered in different situations .
let &apos;s refer to a few cases to understand how these dialogue management tasks are performed .
for example , in the dialogue shown on the left , the user wants to reserve a room , the bot asks how long he intends to stay , and the user says &quot; till next Monday , &quot; to which the bot says &quot; OK . &quot;
the user then changes his mind and says , &quot; please make it till next Tuesday , &quot; and the bot says &quot; OK . &quot;
what happened during this dialogue ?
firstly , there was an interpretation of int@@ ents and slots , naturally .
for example , the intent was identified as room reservation , the merchant as Beijing Hotel , and the check @-@ in date as September 14 .
during the second turn of dialogue , the user updated a slot by adding the check @-@ out date , which was September 17 .
the previous two slots and the intent were inherited .
this is the function of remembering and updating historical information .
and the slot can also be over@@ written .
for example , when the user spoke the third sentence , the check @-@ out date was updated to September 18 .
that is the function of over@@ writing information .
in general , that is how the memory and update mechanism of UN@@ IT works .
in the second case , let &apos;s take a look at the clarification function .
this is a slot @-@ filling task .
let &apos;s first look at the dialogue on the left .
&quot; I want to reserve a room and stay for three days , &quot; says the user .
the bot asks , &quot; What is the check @-@ in date ? &quot;
&quot; next Monday . &quot;
then the bot asks , &quot; When would you like to check out ? &quot;
the user becomes unhappy here .
I &apos;ve already said I want to stay for three days from next Monday , why ask again ?
shouldn &apos;t you be asking me where I want to stay ?
why is this happening ?
it is related to the slot @-@ filling logic of UN@@ IT .
when some configurations are unsatisfactory , some dialogues as weird as that on the left will result .
let &apos;s take a look at the slot @-@ filling logic of UN@@ IT first .
after UN@@ IT identifies the int@@ ents and slots naturally , what will it do ?
it will check the schema of the int@@ ents and slots to see whether the trigger conditions are met or not .
if not met , it will make some clari@@ fications as in the dialogue on the left .
but the clari@@ fications are made in a certain order .
what is the order ?
the clari@@ fications are made in the order that the slots were defined .
when the configuration is unsatisfactory , for example , the order of defining slots becomes check @-@ in date , check @-@ out date , number of nights , and hotel name .
if the check @-@ out date is missing here , UN@@ IT will clarify the check @-@ out date instead of the hotel name first , which can be troublesome .
to avoid such unsatisfactory configurations , there are two solutions .
the first is to re@@ order the slots , putting the hotel name at the very front so that it will be clarified first .
this can solve the problem .
the second option is to split the intent , that is , to split the intent of reser@@ ving a room into two .
one is to reserve a room based on number of nights , and the other one is to reserve a room based on the check @-@ out date .
this may be a better solution .
for example , when reser@@ ving a room based on number of nights , the slots are hotel name , check @-@ in date , and number of nights ; when reser@@ ving a room based on the check @-@ out date , the slots are hotel name , check @-@ in date , and check @-@ out date .
in this way , the weird question in the above dialogue can be avoided .
OK , let &apos;s take a look at the third case on how to deal with if @-@ else dialogue logic .
the dialogue in the third case is about increasing credit limit .
when the user requests to increase their credit limit , it is necessary to assess their qualifications .
this is the third task of dialogue management as we mentioned just now , and that is to trigger dialogue log@@ ics in specific situations .
the bot judges the users to be qualified .
then , what will it say ?
&quot; OK , your credit limit can be increased up to 50,000 yuan . what amount would you like to increase it to ? &quot;
this is the general logic .
to establish if @-@ else dialogue log@@ ics , I suggest using the DM Kit introduced below .
DM Kit is a local dialogue management module which can run within the developer &apos;s own machine environment and integrate seam@@ lessly with our UN@@ IT cloud .
because it is a local module , it allows you to write codes to perform some complex multi @-@ state processes .
in addition , it also supports databases and Web H@@ ook mechanisms , and can access some external resources .
for example , in the above case , the information that the user can increase their credit card limit to 50,000 yuan must have been acquired by quer@@ ying the business base .
DM Kit can provide good support for this .
finally , since it is an open source module , we can flexibly develop and extend it .
to find out more about DM Kit , you can visit the G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b website through the link below .
OK .
that &apos;s all for this lesson .
thanks ๏ผ
good afternoon , everyone .
three apples have changed the world .
the first one helped Adam discover that he is p@@ ant @-@ less .
the second apple brought Newton to Universal Gr@@ av@@ itation .
the third Apple let us know that everyone deserves a smart@@ phone .
and my apple , in this sense , is this picture , which was taken around 70 years ago .
the two people in the picture split away after they took the picture .
what &apos;s interesting about this picture is that both wore the same type of suit named as Zhong@@ shan Su@@ it .
the Zhong@@ shan suit was introduced by Sun Yat @-@ sen .
it actually contains much information .
for instance , it has five buttons that represent separation of five powers .
what about the four pockets ?
they stand for the four foundations of a nation .
courtesy , righteousness , honesty and sense of shame .
there are three buttons on the right sleeve , representing the ten@@ et - &quot; of the people , by the people and for the people . &quot;
and three on the left , standing for equality , freedom and fraternity of mankind .
well , from the perspective of computers , they have basically the same interface , is that right ?
but we all know deep down inside , their ker@@ n@@ els are different .
or to put it this way : one group of people followed the Three Principles of People and Christianity and another pursued the Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
they are just like two &quot; operating systems &quot; battling against each other .
in the end , the one on the left went somewhere else .
and that place is called Taiwan , which has witnessed rapid development over the years .
over the course of last 70 years , Chinese Mainland and Taiwan have experienced drastic changes that are quite different from each other .
we all can feel that .
we can compare from various aspects such as economy , culture and many others .
but why would there be such huge differences ?
for instance , in the mobile internet industry , we have the i@@ OS operating system and Andro@@ id system , an ecosystem created by Google .
Microsoft is doing the similar thing , asp@@ iring to re@@ make itself as one of the mobile internet giants .
you see , all competition is after all the competition of operating systems .
so when we see the world via this operating system , the society , shouldn &apos;t we also be thinking through a social operating system ?
or in the case of the mobile internet , do you understand what &apos;s competing here ?
it is actually a competition between different operating systems .
that &apos;s the reason why Google , founder of Andro@@ id , took a strong stance lately , quite surprisingly , for@@ bidding Ac@@ er to release phones that have installed Ali@@ baba &apos;s operating system .
so now you have a sense of the importance of differences in operating systems .
but what is it like in the light of society ?
in fact , civilization is what &apos;s defined as operating system in the social context .
here in the chart , there are four levels and seven modules that can match one another .
for example , our heart is like hardware with a CPU .
so how do we drive our body , so to speak ?
of course sex drives our body .
anything else that you see ?
there is a kernel , which is the way we see the world , that drives our body .
right ?
over it , there are our values and prospects of life .
so accordingly , there are many other virtual machines or parts built above the operating system , something we normally refer to as basic service .
another important thing is language which I &apos;ve marked in another color .
this language is what we use to communicate , just like the one we use to communicate with people .
above that we can create our own applications , right ?
we have different applications inside the i@@ OS or Andro@@ id system , regarding many aspects of our life , such as clothes , food , housing , travel , medicines and elderly care , and even corpor@@ ates , laws and institutions .
everything can find its counterpart in the past .
we live in this operating system , just like our phones .
so do we have room for multiple operating systems in a large system ?
does it work that way ?
so how do we do it ?
we might try to build our own operating system using this way .
four levels , seven modules .
you can replace the modules as you want .
you all hear me .
for example , what is sex ?
the desire for food and sex is part of human nature .
what is our core operating system ?
it &apos;s about changes .
the Chinese classic , Book of Changes , touches upon lots of changes .
going beyond it , we have our Five Con@@ st@@ ant Vir@@ tu@@ es ad@@ n our propaganda slogan .
what you do not want done to yourself , do not do to others .
going beyond , we have our social framework .
what is it then ?
family .
family is the foundation on which our nation and society are constructed .
and over it is our language .
this social operating system is quite simple , actually , perhaps the simplest one in the world among all the other operating systems .
this system was developed almost 2@@ 500 years ago .
who developed it ?
Confucius .
who were on his team ?
ten core C@@ X@@ Os , or the so @-@ called Ten Philosoph@@ ers : including Z@@ il@@ u , Z@@ ig@@ ong , Z@@ eng@@ sh@@ en and etc .
and who else ?
other 72 &quot; Project Man@@ agers &quot; who he deemed also as good performers as well as the other 3000 disciples as his programmers .
right ?
how many years did they take to develop such a system ?
almost 14 years during which they paid visits to 10 countries .
what was he doing then ?
to promote his system .
and it had good results .
at least the system he created is still alive after 2000 years .
what &apos;s gone are applications built on the system , like the Qing Dynasty , Yuan Dynasty , Song Dynasty .
the applications have come and gone but never the structure of the system , right ?
you see that the very meaning of the system , including its courtesy and the idea of family , stays .
this understanding reminds us of the fact that we do have something .
if you do it all over again , you can spot other operating systems , including the western civilization based on Socrates &apos; philosophy , or Islam by Mu@@ ham@@ mad , whose influences are in fact over@@ shadowed by ours .
so why on earth did we abandon our operating system ?
so what are we waiting for ?
I think from my perspective , from our perspective , it is about time .
for what ?
let &apos;s open our heart and re@@ install our operating system .
thank you !
good evening , everyone .
I am no expert on extrater@@ restrial life , but I do study human life every day .
my work is about in vitro fertilization or artificial fertilization .
everyone in this room today may have heard of IV@@ F , but I don &apos;t think many of you can tell exactly what IV@@ F is , and some of you may even have some misunderstandings .
well , a few years ago , one of my patients asked me after her eggs were taken , &quot; Doctor Ku@@ ang , when can I come back to take my baby ? &quot;
she overes@@ tim@@ ated me .
and she thought I could make in a test tube a real baby that could laugh and cry .
in fact , the technology is far less developed than she thought .
what we can do today is IV@@ F and embryo transfer .
we use merely two materials to create life .
what we do is inject sper@@ ms into eggs , which sounds simpler than cooking .
the egg looks as big as a panc@@ ake , but it &apos;s actually very tiny with a diameter of about only 140 micro@@ meters .
how wide is 140 micro@@ meters ?
merely 0.@@ 14 milli@@ meters .
sper@@ ms are even smaller , each at three to five mic@@ rons across .
therefore , all our work are done under microscop@@ es .
the union of an egg and sperm would produce a fertili@@ zed egg .
a human fertili@@ zed egg .
bi@@ ologically , the moment of fertilization implies the true union of a man and a woman .
the combination of their gene witnesses their love and gives birth to their children .
once the genetic material of a man and a woman is united and fertili@@ zed , a new life is born and grows in acc@@ cord@@ ance with a set of procedures .
the fertilization is like a start button , from the moment it is pressed , a life begins following a natural course .
having been doing my work for 17 years , whenever I see embryo changes and grows day by day , I still feel amazed at the wonder of life .
given the current technology , however , bl@@ ast@@ ocy@@ sts can only be cultured in vitro and then transferred into the uterus , otherwise the embryo will die .
once the embryo is successfully planted in the uterus and everything in place , the embryo will start to grow and eventually becomes a cute baby after a ten @-@ month pregnancy , just like every other natural pregnancies .
in this sense , actually our involvement is rather brief .
we just need to work in the first five to seven days before the pregnancy begins .
after that , all happens in the uterus , which is a normal and natural process .
now , when we talk about this , the IV@@ F and the embryo transfer sound easy , but it is in practice rather complicated , since they are typically considered as high technologies .
for some may suffer repeated embryo transfer fails .
some fail because of their advanced maternal age , of certain uterine damage , of infertility or other complex factors .
all these will result in repeated transfer failures .
doctors would offer two options for patients in such situations .
option one , I will tell them , &quot; The success rate of your transfer is too low , maybe you should leave it . &quot;
but can their problems be solved after we send them home ?
no , they still are in pain .
meanwhile , we fail as a doctor and there are regrets .
therefore , as doctors , we never choose this option easily nor give up on a patient .
sometimes , my patients will ask me , &quot; Is this going to work , Doctor Ku@@ ang ? &quot;
I will tell them that I have no idea because I &apos;m not a fortune teller .
on top of that , my confidence is built on yours , since we are in this together and we can boost each other &apos;s confidence .
then she said , &quot; Thanks for your re@@ assurance . I &apos;ll keep doing it . &quot;
so giving up is never an option for us .
vit@@ ri@@ fication , a new technology we have been developing from 2006 , is much better than the traditional freezing technology , providing a higher survival rate for th@@ awed embryos .
then we initiated the study of natural cycle and micro@@ stimulation technology .
the advancement of this technology led us to think differently , and bl@@ azed a new way of thinking which focuses on embryo freezing .
to put it in another way , it means that we freeze the embryo after obtaining it , instead of transferring immediately .
these j@@ ars are used for storing embryos .
in our lab there are dozens of j@@ ars filled with thousands of embryos , all of which are precious lives .
now , the fresh transfer is replaced by the frozen embryo transfer .
thanks to this new way of thinking , this patient successfully conceived after her 13th embryo transfer in 2009 , and gave birth to a healthy boy in May 2010 with c @-@ section .
a few days ago , she mess@@ aged me , saying that her son is handsome , smart , and is turning two years old . she is so happy and plans to visit me in Shanghai with her son .
from this example , we can learn that it is love that keeps her going .
if we give birth to a new life for money , but not for love , just as sur@@ rogate mothers do , then that is a different matter .
we know that pregnancy doesn &apos;t always go well .
most of the women here today may have experienced vomiting during pregnancy and sometimes even severe vomiting .
can you imagine how serious the case of one of my patient ?
she was vom@@ itting blood , yet she refused to take any medic@@ in .
I finally managed to persuade her into taking it and she agreed .
if she was a sur@@ rogate mother , could she endure such pain ?
I don &apos;t think so .
today &apos;s pregnant women will quickly warp themselves in radiation @-@ proof clothing , indicating that they are expecting .
they also place great care in what they eat and use , and even stay away from iP@@ ads and smart phones to avoid radiation .
all these care@@ fulness show their care and protection for their baby .
will sur@@ rog@@ ates be like this ?
will they quit smoking ?
stop drinking ?
or stop using drugs ?
will they change their ways of thinking and acting ?
I don &apos;t think so .
what sur@@ rog@@ acy brings are not only theses problems , but other hidden dangers .
this is a sur@@ rog@@ acy scandal in Guangzhou , China . a couple hired two sur@@ rogate mothers to give birth to eight babies simultaneously .
it is a scandal because it is impossible for any legitimate hospital to transfer so many embryos at one time .
the hospital in this case transplanted three bl@@ ast@@ ocy@@ sts to each sur@@ rogate mother at the same time .
to ensure a high success rate , bl@@ ast@@ ocy@@ st is generally transferred one by one , two at most .
three means a pretty high premature birth rate .
it is obviously that such kind of sur@@ rog@@ acy is undertook by illegal underground agencies , which conduct non @-@ standard and illegal medical practice .
therefore , it is hard to foresee the long @-@ term impact on future generations .
so , of course , sur@@ rog@@ acy is also getting ent@@ angled with soci@@ ological issues .
let &apos;s try to picture this in our mind , for the sake of money , there are so many women who are willing to give birth to a baby for other women .
what drives them into doing this ?
poverty .
then the poor would likely to be a fertility tool for the rich if sur@@ rog@@ acy is no longer under supervision , which will undoubtedly cause new social inequality .
for this reason , sur@@ rog@@ acy is prohibited and not allowed in our country .
therefore , if an expec@@ tant mother gives birth to a new life for something other than love , the issues that may harm the society and the new life will emerge one after another .
only when love is the reason that the concei@@ ving of life is natural and the life could receive better care .
so , when there is love , there can be new life .
thank you all .
thank you , host .
so just now the host mentioned commercial information in ranking auctions , as well as false , misleading , useless , boring or even poisonous information .
just like you , I am per@@ pl@@ exed in the face of these information every day .
and I want to share with you some of my personal experiences .
first of all , I would like to ask everyone , do you want to know what President Obama and President Hu Jintao discussed when they met in South Korea in the past few days ?
I mean the video , not the news reports .
do you want to know what government dig@@ nit@@ aries Hillary , the US Secretary of State , was meeting with ?
what did she say about China to her partners ?
do you want to know how the US Congres@@ smen and Congres@@ s@@ women squ@@ ab@@ bled over the strategies towards Asia and China to a boiling point ?
do you want to know what the mo@@ gul@@ s in your fields of business are talking about ?
when I am commu@@ ting or working out in the gym , I would take whatever time I have to track these information instead of listening to music .
the information are not obtained through secret channels .
they are free and available to the public on the Internet .
you can find them as long as you are willing to .
and I also broadened my horizons through this long tracking process , which allows me , in my own words , to live a life knowing everything that I need to know .
I believe that everyone here may also be interested in doing so .
you can try to use these online resources like me .
next , I am going to tell you a story in which I helped one of my clients , a Hong Kong operator , to bid in a radio spectrum auction a few years ago .
here I &apos;d like to give you some information about the context .
in China , the domestic mobile network operators , like China Mobile , China Telecom and China Unic@@ orn , must obtain government @-@ issued licenses before they go into 2@@ G or 3G mobile network business .
in China , the licenses are directly allocated to operators .
but in many developed countries , they should be obtained in a commercial way , like auctions .
it &apos;s the same case with Hong Kong .
the schedule was tight when I accepted the task , and the information I had was less than adequate .
so I plunged into the Internet seeking for useful information like I always did .
finally , I found the official website of Office of the Communications Authority of Hong Kong .
it &apos;s this one .
in one corner of that website , I found all the public information about the spectrum auction , including its plan , procedure and even progress , as well as its earlier hearings .
then I read those files and got a whole picture of the auction .
you see , with all these true and useful information , how hard can it be for me to work out a plan for my client ?
my next story is about smart grid .
smart grid is very popular , particularly in recent years .
if you haven &apos;t heard about it , search online .
but today I &apos;m not going to talk about smart grids .
I want to show you how I quickly built a knowledge system about it .
when you browse online the news about the sector of smart grid , you may find them contradictory and confusing .
but we , as an IT company , cannot plan our business based on these information .
we must know what &apos;s really going on with the sector of smart grid .
what is the truth about smart grid ?
so I went online in order to gather information as fast as I can .
later I found that , the National Institute of Standards and Technology of the United States , N@@ IS@@ T , had been commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy to conduct a systematic study of smart grid .
and they disclosed all the information about the study and the organizations involved on the Internet .
these information included the blue@@ prints , work plans , serial meeting schedules , meeting minutes , and road@@ maps relating to smart grid .
having gathered these information , I joined in the discussions and I quickly built up a systematic knowledge map which incorporates at least the core information of smart grid .
the other day I ran into one of our industry executives in China , and I asked him , &quot; Have we been involved in similar discussions ? &quot;
he said : &quot; no , we will send a delegation to the meetings of the International Standards Organization to acquire related knowledge . &quot;
here I would like to remind you that what the ISO did for this matter was only voting .
the real technical work was done in institutions like N@@ IS@@ T .
how do we vote since we did not involve in any of the initial discussions ?
I think this is what many of our peers in the industry should reflect on .
in particular , I would like to say to our so @-@ called government think tanks : have you ever spent time using these good and direct information resources to effectively advise our decision makers ?
as the saying goes : &quot; listen to both sides and you will be enlightened , heed only one side and you will be ben@@ igh@@ ted . &quot;
these examples I have shared with you today are intended to tell you that in the face of information as vast as the open sea , I am very confident , to say the least .
I dare to use them without being overwhelmed by their multitude .
this is my attitude towards exploring the truth about information .
as long as you have the mindset like mine , all you need to do is to put it into practice .
so how do you start ?
when you &apos;re searching online , you can open a few more pages and links .
I believe by doing that , you will be one or more steps closer to the truth .
this has nothing to do with whether or not you know information technology , and it &apos;s more irrelevant whether you are an expert .
it industry has been known for extremely frequent updates .
new concepts , terms , technologies , models , and waves spring up on daily basis .
it &apos;s hard to catch up with them .
nonetheless , I still dare to ride the waves at my age , and I feel very confident to do it .
I think if I can do it , so can you .
thank you !
hello , everyone !
welcome to the advanced course on the UN@@ IT dialogue system .
I &apos;m Sun Shu@@ qi , an R &amp; D engineer for UN@@ IT platform .
in this lesson , we will learn about UN@@ IT &apos;s feedback learning mechanism .
the reason for having a feedback learning mechanism is to prevent abnormal conditions from disrup@@ ting the normal operation of UN@@ IT .
for example , abnormal requests before N@@ L@@ U and abnormal results after N@@ L@@ U will all cause problems for UN@@ IT &apos;s operation .
ordinary users will find it difficult to deal with such problems , so we need to introduce some mechanisms to solve these problems .
when a request arrives , we first need to determine whether it is a feedback or a normal request .
if it is a feedback , it needs to be sent directly to DM so as to modify the dialogue state and dialogue result at the previous turn .
if it is a normal request , we need to perform a quality check of the N@@ L@@ U result after the N@@ L@@ U procedure .
it will only be sent to DM if the N@@ L@@ U result is of good quality .
if the N@@ L@@ U result is of poor quality , the corresponding clarification mechanism will be triggered to get the user to clarify the result .
of course , we also need to have a feedback memory mechanism at the end .
the feedback memory mechanism works like this - if a particular request has been given feedback before , subsequent identical or similar requests will be handled using the same feedback result , thus preventing past errors from re@@ occurring .
next , let &apos;s see what functions there are for feed@@ backs .
the first function is correcting AS@@ R errors .
there are five ways to do that - clarifying the correct Chinese character by using a word , clarifying the correct Chinese character by using a radical , clarifying the correct Chinese character by using dis@@ assembled components , partial repeating of the phrase , and full repeating of the phrase .
here are some examples .
as you can see , speech recognition errors can be fixed .
the second function is intervening in N@@ L@@ U results .
when an error occurs in the interpretation of int@@ ents and slots , we can correct the result and thus allow the dialogue to proceed normally by using natural language utter@@ ances , as shown in this example .
aside from intervention mechanisms , there are also clarification mechanisms .
this refers to UN@@ IT &apos;s ability to pro@@ actively initiate queries regarding potential errors , such as queries about int@@ ents and slots when the int@@ ents are vague or the slot has more than one possible meaning .
these proactive queries will help to prevent problems from occurring .
lastly , the feedback memory can be added to the sample set to assist the training of the natural language understanding module .
you can learn more about this function in the feedback learning log .
for example , in this one : &quot; Cai X@@ uk@@ un is so handsome ! &quot;
do you mean you want to listen to his songs ?
no , I &apos;m just f@@ ang@@ ir@@ ling .
during this dialogue , &quot; Cai X@@ uk@@ un is so handsome &quot; is labeled as a sy@@ s _ other intent .
after training , the same clarification process will not be repeated if the same utter@@ ance appears again .
instead , it will be directly handled as a sy@@ s _ other intent .
OK , that &apos;s all for this lesson .
thank you !

hello , everyone .
today , I am pleased to introduce to you how to quickly create an AR app using AR Open SD@@ K .
first , I will introduce the AR access process , which consists of three steps .
first , the developer acc@@ esses the Baidu developer back@@ stage with a Baidu account , creates an AR @-@ capable app , and down@@ loads the AR Open SD@@ K .
second , upload the AR content package to the AR content platform .
third , integrate the AR SD@@ K into the app .
I shall now demonstrate the whole process .
first , visit ai@@ .@@ ba@@ id@@ u@@ .com .
choose Con@@ sole .
log in your Baidu account .
choose Product Service and then AR .
click Cre@@ ate Ap@@ p .
enter Ap@@ p Name .
choose Ap@@ p Type and Interface Type .

fill in Ap@@ p Description .
return to Ap@@ p List .
by now , an AR @-@ capable app has been created .
next , download the AR SD@@ K .
navigate to the management page .
click Download SD@@ K .
find AR .
two options , one for Andro@@ id and one for i@@ OS , are provided . download the one you need .
let me now introduce these two versions .
first , the Andro@@ id version .
I will introduce the content in the SD@@ K .
the SD@@ K consists of five parts .
the first part is a basic developer document .
the second part is a demo .
the third part is a li@@ bs folder which contains jar packages and corresponding so libraries .
the fourth part is the resources required during AR usage .
developers can copy them to their projects .
the sample folder contains AR content creation cases .
developers can conduct development based on these cases .
next , I will introduce how to upload an AR app .
find Content Cre@@ ation .
choose Cre@@ ate New Project .
choose a template like IM@@ U Tem@@ plate .
click on Next Step .
set Project Tit@@ le .
choose the app we created just now , AR test , for Channel Selection .
click on Next Step .
choose Resource Pack@@ age .
for the resource package content , we can find IM@@ U in the sample folder in the AR SD@@ K package we downloaded just now .
click Sub@@ mit .
by now , the AR content package in this case has been uploaded successfully .
two values , AR Key and AR Type , are generated .
they will be used during AR SD@@ K integration .
next , I will introduce how to integrate the AR Open SD@@ K into your project directory .
first , import the decom@@ pressed jar package and corresponding so libraries to your project .
in addition , copy the resource files on which the AR runtime environment depends to your res directory .
third , configure the Man@@ if@@ est file and add the permissions necessary for the AR runtime environment .
fourth , initi@@ alize the AR environment in the codes and add AR Fr@@ ag@@ ment to your page .
first , initi@@ alize resources .
set the Ap@@ p ID , API Key and Secret Key for your app .
in addition , set the AR Key and AR Type for the resource package that displays the AR content .
the third step is to create an AR Fr@@ ag@@ ment and add the Fr@@ ag@@ ment to your layout .
the AR SD@@ K provides a C@@ all@@ back interface .
it contains three inter@@ fac@@ es@@ - one sharing interface , one URL sending interface , and one AR black@@ list call@@ back interface .
by now , AR integration has been completed .
next , we will introduce the i@@ OS version .
let &apos;s take a look at the content of the AR SD@@ K for i@@ OS .
first , the AR SD@@ K folder has a speech synthesis AR SD@@ K , AR @-@ T@@ TS , and a voice recognition AR SD@@ K , AR @-@ Voice .
it also contains the resource package , header files , and customized UI .
let &apos;s take a look at project configuration .
first , in the project , set the Bun@@ dle ID as the i@@ OS package name that you entered when creating the app .
second , choose Buil@@ d S@@ etting in project configuration and set Other Lin@@ ker Fl@@ ags .
third , if the AR SD@@ K of the general availability version is used , you need to import the ai@@ p.@@ license .
fourth , enable the relevant permissions .
fifth , add third @-@ party system libraries required by Dum@@ ix AR .
let &apos;s go to a relevant target project to perform detailed configuration .
first , add the third @-@ party system libraries , AF@@ Net@@ working and Z@@ ip@@ Archi@@ ve.@@ a , which are required by Dum@@ ix AR , to the project .
then , add Baid@@ u@@ AR@@ .@@ bundle and its resource files to the project .
then , add Open@@ UI , the include folder , and Dum@@ ix AR to the project .
then , set Other Lin@@ ker Fl@@ ags in Buil@@ d Set@@ tings .
then , in the Inf@@ o list , enable the camera permission , photo library permission , and microphone permission .
then , add the required third @-@ party libraries to the Buil@@ d Ph@@ ases page , including system libraries , AF , and Z@@ ip .
by now , the project configuration for AR SD@@ K integration has been completed .
next , let &apos;s take a look at how to set the Ap@@ p ID , API Key , and Secret Key .
in Ap@@ p@@ Deleg@@ ate , import Baid@@ u@@ AR@@ SD@@ K .
then , when the application launches , an if @-@ statement is required to judge whether your phone model supports AR or not .
if so , set the B@@ und@@ le@@ Path , that is , the resource path .
then , set the AP@@ P ID , API Key , and Secret Key .
by now , the whole AR project has been completed .
that &apos;s all for today .
for more information , visit the Baidu Au@@ g@@ mented Re@@ ality website at ar@@ .@@ ba@@ id@@ u@@ .com .
thank you .
hello , everyone !
I &apos;m Li Peng from Baidu Institute of Deep Learning .
welcome to our course , De@@ eping Learning by P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
in this course , we will focus on basic technologies while keeping track of the cutting @-@ edge progress .
after this course , we hope that you will have a basic understanding of machine learning , know how to use deep learning to solve basic problems related to image processing and natural language processing , and learn to use P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle to realize related models .
this is a 3 @-@ unit course , including eight lessons .
in Unit 1 , I will give you a brief introduction on the basics of machine lean@@ r@@ ning .
in Unit 2 , we will learn basic image processing technology and its realization through two tasks , hand@@ written digit recognition and image classification .
in Unit 3 , we will focus on five problems , that is , word embe@@ dding , re@@ comman@@ d@@ ation system , sentiment analysis , semantic role labeling and machine translation , to show you how to use deep learning to tackle N@@ LP problems and how to realize
well , for your convenience , we have also prepared an interactive ebook . for the configuration details you can refer to the introduction in Beg@@ inner &apos;s Guide .
all right . we are ready . welcome to our course , De@@ eping Learning by P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle !
hello , everyone !
our course is about the art of coding .
to begin with , I &apos;ll introduce myself .
I &apos;m the technical leader of the B@@ FE Team of the Operation and Maintenance Department .
I &apos;m also a member of Baidu &apos;s Py@@ th@@ on and Gol@@ ang code master com@@ it@@ tees .
if you want to know more about me , you can visit my wi@@ ki page .
firstly , I &apos;d like to talk about why we have this course .
many of you have just graduated from college and come to Baidu .
I &apos;d like to point out first that programming in Baidu is quite different from that in college .
when you were students , you programmed for your course assignments or your teachers &apos; projects .
so I assume mediocre coding would just do .
however , in Baidu we are making industrial products for hundreds of millions of users , which requires codes with higher quality .
secondly , I want to clear up some of your misunderstandings through this course .
many of you call programmers &quot; coding farmers &quot; in a self @-@ mo@@ cking way .
many of you believe that you &apos;ll no longer have the energy to continue writing codes after the age of 35 .
some of you reckon that the only way for programmers is to become managers .
so this course aims to shed a new light on the profession of programmers , as well as to give you a correct understanding of software programming .
we often ask which one is more important , knowledge or action .
you have to have a proper knowledge to take a proper action .
we also hope that through this course you can find your way as a software engineer .
it is often said that art is created by artists .
actually an artist has his or her own way of perfecting the skills .
in short , we hope that you will gain a brand new understanding of the profession of software engineers .
now we will have a look at Baidu Trans@@ late API .
how do we invoke the open API of Baidu Trans@@ late ?
we can log in to the platform address ap@@ i.@@ f@@ any@@ i.@@ ba@@ id@@ u@@ .com .
then we will see a page with four tabs .
home Page introduces how to apply for permission and how to access the Baidu Trans@@ late API service .
in API Doc@@ umentation are more detailed descriptions , including definitions of some parameters , descriptions of error codes , some demo programs , and FA@@ Q .
in Help and Support you can find what languages this open platform supports and how to call the service .
in Management Con@@ sole you can manage your developer account and find your usage log .
now , I will show you how to use the API .The picture on the left shows the procedure of application .
for example , if I am a developer and I want to call Baidu Trans@@ late , what should I do ? I should apply for permission on the previous page . once we receive your application , an AP@@ P ID and a secret key will be assigned to you .
then you can access the translation service with the AP@@ P ID and secret key .
actually you are accessing to the server of Baidu Trans@@ late API . after the server receives requests , it will distribute them to translation terminals .
after the translation terminals finish translating , the results will be returned to the developer .
for example , we send a request for translating a very simple word &quot; Hello . &quot;
after receiving the request , Baidu Trans@@ late API server will assign it to a translation terminal , and then the er@@ minal returns the translation result of &quot; Hello . &quot;
shown next is the detailed API documentation . we can visit this address .
I will give a quick explanation on some of the field names used in the documentation .
the first field name is q for query .
the query field indicates the text that we need to translate . it need to be UT@@ F @-@ 8 en@@ coded .
the second field is named FROM .
the FROM field indicates the source language , for example , whether the source language is Chinese or English , or Arabic , or any other languages .
if you don &apos;t specify a language here , you can set the field to auto .
if it is set to auto , our system will automatically determine the source language .
the third field is named TO .
the TO field indicates the target language .
of course we cannot set its value to auto , because we have to specify which language we want to translate the source text into .
the next field is named app@@ id .
it indicates the AP@@ P ID assigned in the application , which can be seen in the Management Con@@ sole .
the next field is for a user @-@ defined random number .
with the AP@@ P ID , the query , the random number and the secret key , we can generate a MD@@ 5 value , that is , a signature .
it is mainly for security reasons .
so , in what format is the result returned by the translation API ? it is in J@@ SON format .
the result returned by the translation API is in J@@ SON , consisting of three fields .
one is the FROM field , indicating the source language .
the second is the TO field , indicating the target language .
the third is the field of translation result .
it contains two sub@@ fields : the source text and the translation . the translation is exactly the result we need .
here is a simple example . it has only 27 lines of code . you &apos;ll see how to use the API from this example .
for example , we can save the file as trans@@ ap@@ i.@@ ph@@ p , and you can copy this paragraph to your own program .
by setting the q field , the FROM field , the TO field , and setting the app@@ id and the secret key , we can do the translation .
OK , let &apos;s run this program now .
the line on the top is the command we need to run the program .
for example , if we set the source language field to auto , the system will automatically determine the source language .
a@@ and the target language is set to Z@@ H , standing for Chinese .
all the supported languages and their corresponding codes can be found on the website .
for example , we want to translate such a sentence &quot; What are you doing now ? . &quot;
OK , let &apos;s type it into the program .
after par@@ ing the returned J@@ SON string , we can see that the translation result of &quot; What are you doing now &quot; is returned .
you can use this program to translate anything you like .
here are two application cases .
on the left is a case of S@@ ans@@ ung Mobile calling Baidu Trans@@ late API . it is S @-@ pen Trans@@ late .
for example , hovering your S @-@ P@@ en onto any words on the screen of your Samsung mobile phone , the translation you want will instantly show up in front of you . you don &apos;t even need to leave the current screen and switch to another app .
for example , when we read on a brow@@ er any foreign @-@ language text that we don &apos;t understand , we usually copy the text and paste it to a translation software to get the translation .
but with the S @-@ pen Trans@@ late feature , we can di@@ ec@@ tly select the words we want to translate .
the picture on the right shows a case of Z@@ TE Mobile calling Baidu Trans@@ late API .
they combine speech and translation technologies to provide speech @-@ to @-@ speech transl@@ tion .
of course , speech @-@ to @-@ speech translation is also a feature of Baidu Trans@@ late Ap@@ p .
Baidu Trans@@ late API was launched in May 2012 . it now supports translation among 28 languages .
the number of languages it can translate is increas@@ ing. and the advantage of this API is that there is no limit on access frequency , and the service level agreement , S@@ LA , is up to 99.@@ 99 % .
each month you can enjoy a free translation service for no more than 2 million characters .
if you have more to translate , we will charge a fee accordingly . but It &apos;s not high , it &apos;s obsol@@ utely reasonable .
at present , 20 thousand developers are using the Baidu Trans@@ late API .
among them are King@@ soft IC@@ I@@ BA , Hua@@ wei , op@@ po , Z@@ TE , Samsung , Ali@@ pay , and the World Intellectual Property Organization .
all of them have established a good cooperative relationship with Baidu Trans@@ late .
other users and developers are also welcome to access Baidu Trans@@ late through API and experience the service of Baidu Trans@@ late .
thank you .
hello , everyone !
welcome to the advanced course on the UN@@ IT dialogue system .
I am Sun Shu@@ qi , an R &amp; D engineer for the UN@@ IT platform .
in this lesson , we will learn about dialogue states and action triggers .
during the previous lesson on dialogue management , we learned about the various dialogue management functions on UN@@ IT , which are performed by using dialogue states and action triggers .
in fact , a dialogue state is passed over each turn of a dialogue .
we may often find dialogues like these when booking a hotel , for example .
in a multi @-@ turn dialogue , int@@ ents , slots and other information of each turn need to be passed , and they constitute the entire dialogue state .
a dialogue state is also called a session .
it is stored in the bot _ session field of the request interface and the response interface .
all of you should have seen this field in the documents .
it is passed between UN@@ IT and the developer , or the requ@@ ester .
and , it is updated by UN@@ IT .
when certain conditions have been fulfilled , the developer can also clear the dialogue state , that is , to reset it .
for example , we can clear it when there is a change of int@@ ents .
we may also configure the system to not store sessions before the N@@ th turn of dialogue .
it works just like in the diagram on the left .
first , we have an empty session and we pass it to UN@@ IT .
unit responds and at the same time updates the session .
then , during the second round of request , the session is passed as it is , and so on and so forth .
unit will clear the session when a certain condition is triggered .
the requ@@ ester can also send an empty session to clear the current one .
with dialogue states , we can trigger dialogue actions based on some Bo@@ ol@@ ean rules .
Bo@@ ol@@ ean rules essentially involve the operations of AND , OR , and NOT .
they can be used to determine what the intent of the previous turn is , Whether the slots of this turn or the previous turn have been filled , and if so , whether it contains something or whether it equals to something .
the picture on the right shows such expressions on our system interface .
there are a series of trigger rules and some expressions .
these rules can be placed into groups within which they are of the AND relation , and among which they are of the OR relation .
we can trigger a series of dialogue actions based on such Bo@@ ol@@ ean expressions .
what kinds of dialogue actions specifically ?
as we can see , there are three .
the first one is answering , the second one is guide toward a dialogue intent , and the third is guide toward a Q &amp; A intent .
answering include two types , namely answering in text form and executing functions .
you can read the detailed descriptions of these types of answering in the diagram on the left .
I shan &apos;t go over them in detail .
next , I have two tips to share .
first , we can have different actions triggered in different sequences .
second , we can provide multiple dialogue actions for the developer , or the caller at the same time , then allow them to decide which ones to execute , ranging from all to none .
OK , that &apos;s about it .
thank you !
everybody wants to make some changes in life , only that life is not so easy to be changed .
there is one fairly easy way you might count on though : through design .
the following pictures show a designer of our company .
he says his mom sees him as an artist and a good drawer .
in the eyes of his friends and clients , he is a mani@@ ac with crazy ideas .
designers , according to the public , are more or less a group of ec@@ centr@@ ics .
but what exactly are those designers like ?
I &apos;ve just said something about the designers .
now perhaps , since we &apos;ve known more about them , we could return to this question : what is design ?
to define or explain the connotation of design sounds like a con@@ un@@ drum , so here I &apos;d prefer to share with you some of what I call the great works of design .
the public always holds that designers create very fancy works .
only those splendid works , such as a particular object or a car , or only the Italian designs , are thought to deserve the title &quot; great . &quot;
that is not true .
look around and watch closely , we will find in our life a lot of great designs .
like this product here , whose global sales have far surpassed that of I@@ Phone .
it &apos;s a core product of 3@@ M , named &quot; the Post @-@ It note . &quot;
so could this be called a design ? what is this ? it is nothing so fancy , but it is a truly great design .
then there is the z@@ ipper , invented during World War II .
it looks neither so fancy nor so cool , but it is essential to us .
let &apos;s take a look at this one . it is a simple , square card , but it helps conduct financial , cash and bank settlement in a unified system .
all those are great designs in our life .
they are not necessarily created by a master , but could rather be the creation of any one of you .
now let &apos;s take three minutes to make a simple design , a very small one . let &apos;s design a toothbrush .
I want to do this because I &apos;d like to tell you how designers work .
now there are already so many kinds of tooth@@ brushes on the market , how can we create a new toothbrush that is different from them ?
first , we have to look from a different angle . in what aspect can our toothbrush be different ?
to find where it could be different from others is the first step .
second , we have to watch closely and notice the details .
why does this toothbrush have pointed bri@@ st@@ les , and that one , thicker bri@@ st@@ les ?
that means different functions and different demands from consumers .
we also need to think about technologies beyond the scope of toothbrush manufacturing , for example , is there any new material or new possibilities for our toothbrush ?
and of course the trend is also our concern .
we &apos;ll study how people would like our design to go in future , and what they &apos;d really want .
after studying so many resources and basics , we &apos;ll compare and find a possibility , which is not necessarily a toothbrush though .
then we learn to translate this possibility into a tangible language , which might generate many sub @-@ possibilities .
but not all of them can be successful in market .
we have to filter , layer by layer , through the consumers , the market and our clients . and finally there is the best one left .
here I also want to introduce some designers to you .
some of them perhaps you are quite familiar with .
who is it ? it is a designer . so is he .
this is a designer of music .
his name is John Len@@ non .
and Wright Brothers , who invented the airplane .
and Zhang Y@@ im@@ ou , a designer of films .
this is our great chief designer , who designs our life .
this is a designer in science .
this is a designer in music .
and this is also a designer .
designer is not a stereotyp@@ ed occupation .
the only thing that matters is whether you can think different , take different perspectives and catch things that el@@ ude others .
once I visited a friend in a German design company .
the first thing I saw in his office was a k@@ ay@@ ak suspended from the ceiling .
so I asked him for the reason .
they said because the most beautiful part of a boat was its bottom .
designers must dare to look beneath the surface and see things others don &apos;t see .
that &apos;s the crucial key - thinking different .
unfortunately , Chinese people are prey to the herd mentality .
if a girl wears a min@@ isk@@ irt , then it is quite possible that one or two days later her colleagues will wear a min@@ isk@@ irt too .
this herd mentality in consumption restr@@ ains our independent thinking .
there is another hindrance .
for over two thousand years China was governed by imperial powers , whose rule depended on uniformity .
in our company , there is a popular saying that goes , which goes , Chinese businessmen are all like Wu Dal@@ ang , a famous Chinese fictional dwarf .
they can &apos;t stand employees who are more capable than themselves . they will just lay you off if you stand out .
all the things above contribute to the media &apos;s gr@@ illing : why does China never have a Steve Jobs ?
the reason is we dare not challenge the authority , the standards , or ourselves .
challenging things should be the first step to be taken .
we must change ourselves if we want things to change in life .
here I &apos;d like to share with you how , as designers , we can change ourselves . there are three steps .
first , never yield to standards .
second , try to break down the standards .
third , try to create something new .
those three steps are the tril@@ ogy that marks a good start for a designer .
then what exactly is design ?
actually even till now I haven &apos;t yet figured out how to describe or define it .
over twenty years of designing experience have taught me one thing : design is in fact a way of thinking and working .
the g@@ ist is to think from different angles .
so if we want to change our life and design our own destiny , we &apos;d better learn to change ourselves first and invent a new way of thinking .
that &apos;s all I want to share with you today as a designer .
thank you !
