so this is our last stop , and we came back to our head@@ quarter in Beijing .
I am very excited to have such a large and enthusiastic audience like you guys .
so you have just now learned a bit about our speech technology .
in fact , what we offer is a technology that converts speech , namely what we say , into text .
my job is actually to support the voice technology .
what we need to do , is to figure out a pro@@ pre@@ r way to interpret the information that a text conve@@ ys so that the machine could truly understand the meaning of the text .
so my topic today is &quot; UN@@ IT Language Understanding and Inter@@ action Technology . &quot;
first , let us recall a bit , what is AI ?
it is actually quite simple .
the concept of AI was proposed as early as in 1960s .
since then , scientists and IT engineers have been working relent@@ lessly to achieve one thing , that is , to empower a machine with the capabilities of a human .
so what human capacities we expect from the machine ?
as presented before , first we need the voice capability .
we need the machine to listen and to talk .
apart from that , we need the ability to reco@@ gi@@ ze images .
as I mentioned , the machine need to recognize people and draw a certain images as well .
it should also have the language competence that enables it to understand the language ， i.e. to understand the ac@@ tural meaning behind it .
finally , we expect that the machine have the ability to act , that it can exc@@ ec@@ ute some operations autonom@@ ously .
on top of that , we wish that the machine would be able to think , that it could think and reason as human do .
in addition , we hope that the machine could acquire knowledge , for instance , it should be able to accumulate knowled@@ age and use it during the process of thinking , just as humans do .
then , the last yet very important capacity that we expect from the machine is self @-@ learning .
among all these capacities , I &apos;d like to focus on the language capacity .
first , why do we invest so much in language @-@ related AI technologies ?
because we believe that language is the carrier of our thoughts and knowledge .
why is language considered the carrier of thoughts ?
think about it and we will find out that many of our thoughts and expressions are eventually delivered in the form of language .
just like now , I am giving my presentation through language to express my thoughts .
apart from that , we believe that language en@@ codes knowledge and is the carrier to pass it on .
now , let &apos;s have a look at these pictures , they show the evolution of language from the Ji@@ ahu symbols in ancient times , then or@@ acle bone script , to Internet images and texts of today .
the form that carries knowledge changes and updates constantly .
we will have even more forms in the future .
but what does not change ? language doesn &apos;t .
language enables us to understand knowledge .
we have a 5,000 @-@ year culture .
there are cultures that stretch even longer time , passing on over thousands of years disp@@ ite all sorts of obstacles .
the messages recorded by those languages may probably be the same .
so we believe that language is crucial to AI .
then what do we expect in the modern era ?
actually , we have entered the era of AI , and we expect language to play an important role here .
what role is it ?
over the past years , we have proposed the concept of &quot; Dialogue as a Platform . &quot;
that is , we expect to interact directly with a machine through dialogue , enabling the machine to understand what we say , and say what we expect from it .
now , let &apos;s watch a video .
Xia@@ od@@ u Xia@@ od@@ u , how &apos;s the weather today ?
it is sunny today .
Xia@@ od@@ u Xia@@ od@@ u , go to Kerry Center , Beijing .
I have found three routes .
which one would you prefer ?
the first one .
Xia@@ od@@ u Xia@@ od@@ u , how long will it take to get there ?
it will take one hour and 29 minutes to get there .
Xia@@ od@@ u Xia@@ od@@ u , go to Jo@@ y City , Cha@@ oyang .
the route to Jo@@ y City , Cha@@ oyang is planned .
what do you wanna eat later ?
hot pot .
okay !
Xia@@ od@@ u Xia@@ od@@ u , search for the hot pot restaurants nearby .
which one to go ?
the first one .
start navigation .
Xia@@ od@@ u Xia@@ od@@ u , let &apos;s drop by a gas station !
the route to a gas station on the way is planned .
the function has already been launched .
you can just open Baidu Map and have a try .
so , why do I show you this video ?
actually , it presents a key technology which enables us to con@@ rol a device easily and make it follow the instructions as expected through conversation .
it actually involves capacities such as an@@ ap@@ hor@@ a resolution , multi @-@ turn dialogue , natural language understanding , and ger@@ ner@@ alization of expressions .
these capabilities are actually supported by our core N@@ LP language recognition technology , which is supported by our UN@@ IT platform .
so these capabilities are available on our UN@@ IT platform .
following the example , let &apos;s take a close look at the composition of the dialogue system .
how does the computer generate such a dialogue ?
it simply involves two fields .
the first is voice .
when we say a sentence , the AS@@ R module will convert it into a piece of text .
secondly , it goes to the N@@ LP field .
in this field , we use N@@ L@@ U technology to extract some core knowledge of a text , to figure out its intention .
then , we have dialog state tracking , f@@ using knowledge in multiple turns of the dialogue to determine the last action based on previous states .
next , with a module called N@@ L@@ G , namely natural language generation , we integrate the conversation history , the information we expect the computer to express and the knowled@@ age we have retrieved , to generate a passage that we expect .
then , we synthesize the speech through T@@ TS and let the computer speak .
this is the composition of a complete dialogue system .
such a system seems quite sophisticated , because it involves many key technologies .
we have mentioned various voice technologies , including recognition and synthesis .
as for N@@ LP , you can see that there are many underlying technologies .
in fact , more fundamentally , it also relies on some basic lexical analysis as well as massive user behavior data to learning , which en@@ powers it the capability of fluent conversation and generalization as we have just seen .
so as a matter of fact , for a not @-@ so @-@ large R &amp; D team like us , it &apos;s rather difficult to im@@ por@@ ve these technologies to a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition .
but never mind , we have opened the platform .
we opened UN@@ IT to solve this problem , to enable our developers to achieve this kind of configurations via our platform .
all we need to do is to make simple custom@@ ization on intentions and slots , and provide a training corpus .
now , let &apos;s look at the specific supports provided by the platform .
firstly , as mentioned before , we have technologies .
secondly , we have strong capabilities for custom@@ ization .
we also have massive big data from the real world .
all of these are offered as a package on UN@@ IT .
we wish to open our technologies and apply them to various products .
meanwhile , we can work with our developers to jointly create a resonant eco @-@ system .
this involves two most critical technologies .
one is N@@ L@@ U , and the other is multi @-@ turn interaction .
most importantly , the two critical technologies are supported by our fundamental technologies and data .
let &apos;s look at the platform in detail .
firstly , it provides the ability to understand intentions and slots .
this is actually easy .
for example , when a user says something which we call it a &quot; query , &quot; our recognition module will recognize it as an intention of restaurant reservation .
then , we extract the key information from the query and norm@@ alize it , like the name of the restaurant , the reservation time and the number of customers .
in real scenario like this , users normally would not give all key information to the machine in one go .
for example , when we discuss having a meal together with our friends , we usually do not tell them &quot; Let &apos;s go to Quan@@ j@@ ude tonight at 6 p.m. &quot; at once , do we ?
we tend to express our needs step by step .
so such a way of expression is actually crucial for us to express our needs .
therefore , it naturally comes down to our multi @-@ turn interaction technology .
now , let &apos;s look at the example .
&quot; please reserve a 10 @-@ people room at Quan@@ j@@ ude for me . &quot;
during this process , he actually did not mention the time of reservation .
that &apos;s OK .
our machine will automatically ask me &quot; What time would you like the reservation for ? &quot;
OK .
all we need is to say is , &quot; Well , at 6 p.m. , &quot; then it &apos;s done .
besides , we can realize a simple extension via the platform , namely recommendation .
for example , it can ask further &quot; Do you need a taxi at that time to take you there ? &quot;
OK .
all we need is a simple configuration on the platform .
then the system will naturally recommend such a dialogue and guide users to continue custom@@ ization .
this and what mentioned on the last page constitute the convers@@ ational understanding ability in terms of intentions and slots , which is the first function we provide on UN@@ IT .
the next comes to a situation encountered by many of our friends .
that is , I have actually created a big Q &amp; A dat@@ as@@ et .
but I do not intend to build an intention for each of the questions .
all I expect is to pump the Q &amp; A dat@@ as@@ et into my system .
then when a new query comes from a user , for instance , about how to apply for these stuff .
then the platform will automatically find the most sem@@ an@@ tically similar answers from our dat@@ as@@ et and recommend them to the user .
in this way an intelligent conversation for the purpose of customer services or consulting services is finished .
such function is also available on our UN@@ IT platform and was launched at phase II , approximately in September .
well , as I just said , all you need to do is to directly pump a question &amp; answer dat@@ as@@ et into our platform and that is it .
then , after the platform receives some generalized questions from users , it will automatically search for answers in the pool , and finds the most pertinent answers for us .
similarly , a question &amp; answer dat@@ as@@ et in the category of customer service actually need multi @-@ turn dialogue data .
this is because when users ask questions , they usually don &apos;t know what they really expect .
for example , a user expects to know about the loan application process , but he doesn &apos;t know what kind of loans we offer .
that &apos;s OK .
we actually need to guide him step by step with a multi @-@ turn conversation .
after completed the conversation , we recommend a result to the user .
such capabilities are also available on our platform .
so we simply need to integrate the multi @-@ turn conversation mechanism with the question &amp; answer mechanism in order to complete a dialogue of this kind .
as I mentioned before , the above @-@ mentioned two capabilities are our two different solutions for a smart dialogue scenario .
however , such capabilities actually are not fixed , but can be customized according to domain knowledge provided , logic of interaction and via model training .
users can then train their own models according to their business requirements .
these models can in fact be customized on the UN@@ IT platform .
although we just opened the UN@@ IT to the public in July this year , we have been operating it in Baidu for quite a long time .
so we have been accumulating some experience in different scenarios , such as smart customer services , assistants , household appliances , vehicle systems and robots .
now , let &apos;s see ... I &apos;ll present two examples of what else the platform can do .
please play the video .
hello .
hello , Madam .
this is the credit card service center of Innovation Bank , and my ID No. is 100@@ 5 .
I wonder if you have an Innovation Bank credit card in use .
no .
I &apos;m calling to inform you that Innovation Bank has issued a platinum credit card that is free of annual fee permanently .
it granted with a minimum credit of twenty thousand to one hundred thousand , and guarantees free transaction for inter @-@ bank withdraw@@ ls and des@@ pos@@ its in different cities acc@@ ross the country .
since it is a platinum credit card , I &apos;d like to make sure if you have any other banks &apos; credit cards in use for more than 6 months ?
are you a bank staff ?
I &apos;m just calling to introduce you our platinum credit card free of annual fee .
you will be soon contacted by a manager of co@@ stom@@ er service of Innovation Bank and you will have more details of the card .
I have too many credit cards .
madam , it means that your are a longtime credit card holder and you have a good credit record !
please relax , I am just introducing the card , I am not getting you the card .
we have a lot of promotions for our anni@@ ver@@ say .
so I invite you to join .
why not check it out ?
do you have any other banks &apos; credit cards in use for more than 6 months ?
yes , I do .
it offers free lifetime annual fee .
yes .
and if I need it , I will go to the bank .
madam , as you see , you work on work@@ days and bank counters are not always open .
it would waste your time .
isn &apos;t it con@@ vi@@ en@@ ient to do it via a phone call ?
excuse me .
do you have a stable job in Beijing ?
no , I have no job .
Oh , it does not matter , as long as you have fixed income , repayment capacity and fixed phone number for contact .
do you have monthly fixed income ?
I retired long time ago .
Oh , sorry .
thank you for your time .
thanks for taking my call .
have a good day .
good bye .
it fails at last .
but what I intend to show you is actually such a capability .
that is our sales assistant system .
the caller and the receiver are real person .
we often find such a situation about our sales@@ persons .
well , I wonder if you are familiar with this industry or not .
what I want to say is that there are not many sales@@ persons who are very good at selling and saying the right thing at the right time .
in fact , most sales@@ persons need a long @-@ term training , during which they learn what to say under different circumstances .
and the cost and time cost of the training are quite high .
but actually what our system provides is such a function .
during a call , the system pop@@ s up the most appropriate utter@@ ances for a salesperson based on the dialogue scenarios between two persons without much in @-@ depth training .
and the salesperson just need to read them out .
in this way , the successful rate of sales can be greatly improved .
on July 5th , we ann@@ ou@@ ced a develop@@ pers contest called A@@ star .
the contest actually had the full support of our UN@@ IT platform .
and the contest resulted in many interesting innovations .
this is one of the award @-@ winning works in the contest .
it is done by students from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences .
now , let &apos;s watch a video . play the video , please .
recommend me a recipe .
what ingredients would you like to use ?
we have selected the following recipes for you .
sole fish .
how much time do you want to spend on cooking ?
we have selected the following recipes for you .
half an hour .
it &apos;s done .
the third step is to cut the sole fish to small pieces , and mar@@ inate them with two spo@@ ons of cooking wine , a little black pepper and salt for 20 minutes .
wait for 10 minutes .
we will remind you in ten minutes .
show me the picture !
next step .
it &apos;s done . congratulations .
as you can see , it involves the combination of the AS@@ R module and the N@@ L@@ U of our UN@@ IT .
such a product was built by a team of 2 to 3 students .
and it was a interesting product .
now , let &apos;s have a quick refresh@@ er on the core technologies we use at the background to support it .
firstly , the entire UN@@ IT is such a framework that only requires developers to provide some customized goals and training data to start the learning process .
then through rapid validation and continuous optimization we can build a model based on the data .
then we can launch the model directly online , providing all users with the interactive understanding service at the cloud .
the core is the technologies of understanding and matching .
we have applied more than one set of technologies in the model .
actually , we have several sets of technologies working together , supporting the capacities of pres@@ etting , rapid validation and continuous learning .
when combined , these capabilities can provide various functions including N@@ L@@ U and generalization .
these are something more crucial , for instance , our intention recogn@@ iz@@ tion is a neural network model like this .
it can achieve a accuracy of over 80 % in the domain of movie and map , based on 2,000 pieces of data .
as for our semantic matching , no custom@@ ization or training is needed .
I only need to pump dictionaries into the system .
based on our semantic matching technologies shown in the middle , we can map this user &apos;s query in natural language , at the bottom , to the question on the top .
moreover , data is also a driver of upgrading the model .
now we provide two mechanisms on our platform .
one is knowledge recommendation , and the other is active learning .
so we can automatically search for more expressions of questions in Baidu &apos;s big data and recommend them to you to use them in model learning .
in addition , we have abundant capacities for dialogue management , supporting intention conc@@ at@@ en@@ ation , intention change , slot change , clarification , and embe@@ dding .
we also have some rules for cohesion and mechanisms for state memory .
all these are available on our UN@@ IT platform .
now , let us take a look at our development .
as I said before , we launched UN@@ IT on July 5 .
since then , we have had release and upgrade of related technologies every month .
in December , actually this month , we worked out our proposal for commercial deployment .
so you can consult us for more stable commercial deployment .
we will launch our background resource management API this month .
we will also release a chat@@ bot , together with some pres@@ et scenarios this month .
next year , spo@@ iler alert , we will release our strategy 2.0 at the beginning of next year .
what will happen after the release ?
it is very simple .
I just got the performance report for our final experiment yesterday .
about 100 pieces of data were input into our model , which mo@@ cked the real scenario of a online product .
we evaluated the precision and we got an precision over 90 % and a recall over 80 %
that &apos;s what we can do with 100 pieces of data .
we will open the model for you to use at the beginning of next year .
of course we have more than these .
our architecture for training , data analysis , and our capability to help you analyse user queries will all be opened at an appropriate time next year .
so we would like you to use it and give us more feed@@ backs so that we could further upgrade our platform .
OK , at last , I &apos;d like to show you the URL , which is very simple , un@@ it.@@ ba@@ id@@ u@@ .com .
you are welcomed to use it as much as possible .
OK !
that &apos;s my part for today .
next , let &apos;s welcome Ms. Li Ji@@ ar@@ ui , CEO of B@@ ot O@@ range , an important partner of UN@@ IT , to share with us a story of the cooperation of Baidu UN@@ IT and B@@ ot O@@ range .
we have traveled to five cities .
today we are in Beijing , which is our home field , so we are very excited .
before I present the Baidu Open AI Platform , let &apos;s watch a video recorded during our trip in the past five cities .
play the video , please .
on the registration day , a photo was required for AF@@ R sign @-@ in authentication .
I deliberately provided a photo taken three years ago .
to my surprise , Baidu &apos;s AF@@ R sign @-@ in machine recognized me right away .
as an AI company , Baidu owns advanced algorithms in many fields , such as image recog@@ in@@ ition , voice interaction and deep learning .
the three demo demonstrated by the engineer are all well made .
our front @-@ end dev@@ e@@ o@@ pl@@ ers are excited about Baidu AI E@@ cos@@ ystem Partner Program , because it liber@@ ates them from operation and development of underlying technologies , and allows them to focus more on technologies and .
since 20@@ 14 , we have closely worked with Baidu &apos;s AI Department .
the business of Yun@@ va Tech also grew rapidly in 20@@ 14 .
we have enjoyed great benefits of Baidu &apos;s opening of core technologies .
this robot is designed with many technologies from Baidu Open AI Platform .
Baidu &apos;s advantages in big data and AI can quickly improve user experience .
there is no platform so open as Baidu Open AI Platform in China .
I expect that our team can get involved in Baidu AI E@@ cos@@ ystem Partner Program .
partners and developers are welcome to join us .
OK .
after traveling to five cities , we are making steady progress on the program .
we have worked with many partners to promote and implement this program in various industries .
I &apos;ll give you a detailed introduction about this later .
now , I &apos;ll present Baidu Open AI Platform to you .
just now , Mr. Wang briefly introduced Baidu Open AI E@@ cos@@ ystem .
right ?
Baidu started from building a search engine , and has acquired a huge amount of data and technologies .
based on these data and technologies , it developed AI technologies and made them available through platforms like Cloud and terminals .
as for different layers that have been opened , we have got data , algorithms and computer capabilities at the underlying layer , as well as the upper perception and cognition layers .
we have also got voices , images , videos , AR , V@@ R , natural language , knowledge mapping and user profile , which are the most important capabilities at the perception and cognition layers .
we have opened capabilities on the AI platform hoping to hel@@ f enter@@ pr@@ sies and developers develop more innovative business in various industry .
that is the layout of Baidu AI technology ecosystem .
you can take a look at our currently open capabilities shown on the layout .
we can say that Baidu Open AI Platform is the only well @-@ rounded open AI platform with the most technologies available in China .
up till now , we have opened nearly ninety technologies .
our technologies involve voice , O@@ CR , human body recognition / AF@@ R , image cens@@ oring , image recognition , video , natural language understanding , knowledge mapping , AR , data intelligence , and open data set , covering most of the AI areas that we know for now .
we have opened some AP@@ Is and platforms as well as the upper and lower layers .
the lower layer is a deep learning framework which has also been opened .
at the upper layer , we have developed many scenario @-@ based solutions according to the capabilities .
these scenario @-@ based solutions enable developers and partners to integrate the capabilities into their products , and implement them in the industries .
now , I &apos;ll talk about the deep learning platform .
why do I start with it first ?
the deep learning platform serves as a core part of the AI industry and its application .
it integrates modules , methods and capabilities of deep learning into a platform , and made them open @-@ source .
being open @-@ source means that developers can read each code line and find out how it is implemented .
you can rewrite or modify the codes , and apply them in your services .
this is the overall structure we just saw .
P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle is the only deep learning framework launched by a domestic enterprise in China .
we hope that it will be a platform that best meets the requirements of Chinese developers .
as a Chinese company , we understand best the requirements of developers , enterprises and partners in China .
our P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle platform has been open @-@ sourced for more than one year during which it has witnessed a rapid growth of our community .
we have put in many efforts to make it easy to learn and to use .
we know that in China , there are not many developers who truly master the deep learning technologies and can develop deep learning technologies .
according to our estimation , there are only a few thousand developers capable of doing so .
however , we predic@@ ate that tens of thousands of developers will be in demand in the coming years .
so there is a huge gap .
we hope to build a deep learning platform that is simple and easy for more developers to learn and to use , so that they can bring it into play in various scenarios .
moreover , Baidu has been developing applications of deep learning for many years , so we have got many scenarios at Baidu .
next we will open certain industrial applications .
now , let &apos;s see the two charts of community activity .
according to G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b , our framework is as efficient and fast as others , or even more efficient and faster in terms of bug reporting and community expansion .
this is attributed to a huge quantity of users in China .
in addition , our framework is highly internation@@ alized .
we have developed a bilingual system for communication in Chinese and English , which is widely used by many developers across the world .
meanwhile , we have been constantly innov@@ ating our technologies .
we &apos;ll release P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle Flu@@ id , a new and large @-@ scale version .
with this version , developers can compile programs for deep learning with high @-@ level programming language while making sure these programs run as steadily as expected .
we will release this version soon , making it available for developers .
more importantly , we will open more than 20 industrial models .
these models are trained in many scenarios to provide the capabilities which can be downloaded from G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b , an open @-@ source community , and from the model base of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
they can also be applied directly in applications .
as I mentioned before , the demand for AI talents has greatly increased .
now , here are two charts .
some of you may have seen them , and they are from an AI index report recently released by Stanford University .
according to this report , the proportion of AI @-@ related jobs grew very fast in the America in the past few years .
the other chart shows an increasing demand for AI @-@ related talents .
we can find that the growth rate of jobs related to machine learning is the highest .
accordingly , its demand is the largest .
the data comes from a global report from Lin@@ ked@@ In .
according to the report , the demand for AI @-@ related jobs has increased by eight times over the past three years .
I talked about this with a fellow from Lag@@ ou , and he told me that the demand of AI @-@ related jobs increased by 4.2 times in the last one year .
so we can see that on the market , the demand for both AI technologies and talents increases rapidly .
I think that Baidu , as an AI company that continuously innov@@ ates technological concepts , should put more efforts in education .
recently , we have launched a training camp platform on P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
we hope to help more developers to transform into to deep learning engineers .
for example , we provide tut@@ orials on deep learning and over a dozen algorithms of basic models , and share their principles and implementation codes .
we also provide tut@@ orials on P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle for beginners and guidelines for senior developers .
moreover , we provide a MO@@ OC with video courses prepared by Baidu &apos;s deep learning engineers .
some practical cases are available .
they involve our program jointly developed with one of UN &apos;s commissioner a few days ago .
this program aims to help fresh food supermarkets reduce food wasting .
these cases were real@@ is@@ zed with the help of deep learning algorithms .
we can get the source codes from the platform and apply them .
besides , I think the education requires more than just a single company like Baidu .
there are many relevant organizations in the UN .
we &apos;re founding the first deep learning teaching school alliance in China .
in this way , we can support the talent cultivation of deep learning in a more holistic way .
so , what is the deep learning teaching school alliance ?
it focuses on helping developers and students who need to take deep learning courses , study online and offline , and participate in hands @-@ on practices , including contests .
also , they need to have knowledge of AI engineering standards and obtain certificates of AI engineers .
so we collaborate with enterprises in every aspect .
for example , Baidu Institute of Technology has designed a series of courses which can be found in the training camp of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
we &apos;re also working on online courses in collaboration with Ge@@ eks College , J@@ is@@ u@@ an@@ ke , U@@ AI , and UD@@ AC@@ ITY .
moreover , we have te@@ amed up with Bei@@ hang University to offer a course of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle deep learning at their software institute .
we will first promote these courses to the undergraduates and post@@ graduates of Bei@@ hang University .
in the future , we &apos;ll work with more training institutions .
we &apos;ll hold some deep learning contests with U@@ AI and K@@ esc@@ i .
through these contests , I expect that more developers can get inspired and step into the field of deep learning .
moreover , we expect to collaborate with competent institutions and authorities to establish standards and certification systems for deep learning engineers .
Baidu can provide support for the establishment of such standards and systems , including contents .
we offer an all @-@ round tutorial that covers the fundamental parts and the more complicated ones . the tutorial also includes courses on model base .
as for the realization and financial support for P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle , we are in discussion with Du Xia@@ om@@ an Financial Education Credit .
students can apply for our education loan to get an opportunity for education more quickly .
we believe that there will be no problem for them to pay back their loans in the future if they are well trained in deep learning .
we have held many events on campus together with Baidu Education to facilitate the implementation of these courses .
the deep learning platform of Baidu Cloud also serves as a platform for more developers to experience .
Baidu can provide R &amp; D support through the National Engineering Laboratory for Deep Learning Technologies and Applications .
we expect to share Baidu &apos;s resources and cooperate with institutes in each step of deep learning education .
with a comprehensive cooperation and an edu@@ action alliance , we hope to help more developers , including students , to become deep learning engineers that meet the needs of the society , individuals and enterprises .
so this is what we are trying to advance .
we also look forward to working with resourc@@ eful organizations in the training of AI engineers .
next , I will briefly introduce the application of technologies on Baidu Open AI Platform , such as AF@@ R , voice and image .
later , our colleague will introduce the applications and cases in detail to help you better understand and learn about how to apply and implement these technologies .
now , let &apos;s talk about the AF@@ R technology .
in fact , Baidu &apos;s AF@@ R technology is the most open of its kind in every way .
when we talk about AF@@ R , we only know that it is just a facial technology .
actually , it involves a set of capabilities consisting of face detection , face comparison , and li@@ veness detection .
the whole set of capabilities have been completely opened on the open AI platform , including interfaces , SD@@ K@@ s and many custom@@ izable functions .
all of these are now open @-@ source on the platform .
we also provide solutions for various scenarios .
let &apos;s take online AF@@ R @-@ enabled ID verification as an example .
in this hall , all of you have experienced the AF@@ R sign @-@ in .
as for membership verification . later , one of our partners will elaborate on AF@@ R @-@ related solutions and their application .
the solutions also include the the auto @-@ gate project enabled by face recognition .
this is just a part of our solutions .
we provide a concise inter@@ operation procedure which can be carried out from inter@@ operation to implementation within just three days .
in Shanghai , we have announced that the interface of our AF@@ R technologies will be permanently free for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
yes .
for developers and certified enterprises , we provide two Q@@ PS@@ s and five Q@@ PS@@ s for free permanently .
for corporate customers , we provide a guaranteed service in AF@@ R .
now , I &apos;d like to present the O@@ CR .
since Baidu has processed a huge amount of Internet information in the past , it is reasonable to say that Baidu &apos;s O@@ CR capability is second to none .
many partners have adopted our O@@ CR technology , and the number of our O@@ CR developers grows the fastest .
let &apos;s see some cases .
our O@@ CR technology exc@@ els in the recognition of texts in web images , and receipt recognition .
it also delivers great results .
we know that there are many sub@@ divisions in the realm of image recognition , such as fine @-@ gr@@ ained image recognition and image moderation .
in the past years , Baidu has acquired vast technologies of content moderation when working on the Internet search engine .
now we have also opened these technologies .
in this way , the companies inv@@ ov@@ led in a large number of applications or contents on the Internet can quickly adopt these technologies or use the interfaces to meet the cens@@ oring requirements .
there is also an image @-@ based searching platform which I won &apos;t elaborate here .
it can help enterprises in providing highly @-@ customized image search services .
this is a customized image recognition platform , which is one of our main focus now .
we have found that there are a lot of highly distinctive scenarios where the image recognition cannot be trained in advance .
so we provide a simple platform for people to upload their t@@ agged pictures , then we can help them train the model .
we also provide an environment for the deployment of the service to rapidly implement the O@@ CR technology .
based on the O@@ CR technology , we have developed a video processing technology , including the analysis of video contents and selection of video th@@ umb@@ nails .
we have integrated these technologies into our video technology solutions on Baidu Cloud so that you will have easy access to them .
we have also got our voice technologies .
in terms of voice technologies , Baidu has opened all its cutting @-@ edge technologies because we value openness .
in the last stop , we announced to permanently and freely open all the interfaces of Baidu &apos;s voice technologies .
the voice technologies cover the three key aspects which are AS@@ R , speech synthesis and voice wake @-@ up .
what we &apos;ve opened includes the technologies of low @-@ volume voice recognition , meaning that even your whis@@ pers can be recognized .
it can also recognize speech mixed with English and Chinese , languages like Mad@@ arin and Cantonese , as well as varieties like Sic@@ hu@@ anese .
in addition to short conversations , it can recognize long speeches , which can be very useful for making meeting minutes .
we also have the far @-@ field recognition , which is widely applied in smart hardware .
and there is speech synthesis .
in this field , we have opened all capabilities for free permanently .
in this way , more developers can easily get access to these technologies .
this is the purpose and expectation of Baidu AI E@@ cos@@ ystem .
this picture shows our partnerships of voice technologies in various fields .
of course , in terms of natural language processing which Baidu is especially good at , we have also opened a large quantity of N@@ LP operators .
I won &apos;t elaborate on it here .
as for Baidu UN@@ IT , our architect Mr. Sun K@@ e will bring a detailed introduction later .
Baidu UN@@ IT is a leading platform in China for training and developing machine conversation .
with simple configurations on this platform , you can develop applications with robots who can communicate with people automatically .
the platform helps to quickly realize a large quantity of applications , such as smart hardware or online intelligent customer services .
one of our partners is here today to talk about how he applies UN@@ IT to implement a plurality of functions .
there are also solutions for robot vision processing of which we gave a presentation specifically during our tour in Chengdu .
more than that , for example , Mr. Wang talked about our AR Open Platform , which was presented in Hangzhou .
we also have the machine translation platform , which has a long history and has been widely used in the entire industry .
moreover , we have the Smart Open Platform for Data .
as we can see , Baidu Open AI Platform really has a variety of technologies .
besides these abilities , we provide an environment for development , learning , and communicating , like our AI Forum , P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle , and communicating platform in G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b where you can exchange ideas with other developers .
a self @-@ service function is now ba@@ isc@@ ally available on our AI Forum .
many new developers became moder@@ ators or ment@@ ors on the forum to guide more developers and students .
meanwhile , you can except more from Baidu than just technologies , since many developers including our partners have not owned their exclusive brands or technologies yet .
so we have launched Baidu AI E@@ cos@@ ystem Partner Program in Shenzhen .
this program aims to provide support in terms of customer resources , marketing activities , corporate operation and investments in addition to technologies .
we &apos;ll also select excellent partners to join our AI Acc@@ eler@@ ator Program .
we &apos;ll launch this program later on today .
Baidu AI E@@ cos@@ ystem Partner Program is basically solution @-@ oriented .
we hope that the companies in the industry chain can join and collaborate with us .
we provide a variety of resources , such as technological resources , joint branding and customer sharing .
I won &apos;t go into details on the Acc@@ eler@@ ator Program which will be presented later by my colleague .
we hope to build the most open , well @-@ rounded and fai@@ rest AI technological ecosystem in 20@@ 18 .
we also hope to work with partners to train more deep learning engineers , and help more start @-@ ups .
this is our vision for the AI technology ecosystem .
these are some partners that have joined our community recently .
and I feel really honored today to have some representatives of our partners to join us today .
we &apos;ll award them with our partnership certificate later .
that &apos;s all , thank you !
good afternoon , everyone !
I &apos;m very glad to have this opportunity to introduce Baidu &apos;s current voice technology to you .
in fact , the voice technology is a highly focused technology .
we focus on two aspects only .
the first aspect is to recognize the sounds of all things .
the second aspect is to synthesize sounds , and our objective is to synthesize the sounds of all things if possible .
however , 99 % of our work is to recognize and synthesize human voices .
so , I &apos;d like to talk about some achievements recently made by Baidu in the voice technology .
I think that Baidu attaches the greatest importance to the voice technology among all the Internet companies .
we have been constantly and resolutely investing in the voice technology for many years , and we apply every breakthrough technology to our products promptly .
so , if you use Baidu &apos;s products , you can find that almost all of them provide excellent voice @-@ recognition experience .
here are some of these products , and I highly recommend our Baidu Ap@@ p .
the voice search experience on Baidu Ap@@ p is really amazing .
when using it , you can just press the microphone button and speak instead of typing with your fingers .
now , our voice recognition is highly accurate .
we have been constantly investing in this technology , and made new breakthroughs in the voice technology almost every year .
as you can see , in 2012 , we became the first one to apply the deep learning technology and the D@@ N@@ N technology to products among the Internet companies in China .
we all know that the deep learning technology was first developed in 2010 and 2011 .
but breakthroughs lied mainly in academic conferences and public test sets .
in 2012 , we fully migrated the deep learning technology to our product line .
we completely engineered it .
in fact , if you have ever involved in the project , you should know that the accuracy improvement of a public or private test set is greatly different from that of a high @-@ traffic product line .
for example , if you try the voice search function on Baidu Ap@@ p now , you can find that the result is displayed quickly on the screen .
that is , the characters are displayed on the screen as soon as your voice comes out .
we have done a large amount of work to achieve such top @-@ level user experience by shortening the system response time to 100 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds , 50 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds and even 20 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds .
we have also made improvements on the models every year .
I will not talk about them one by one .
later , I will talk about our recent advances in the acoustic models .
our current main breakthroughs are almost concentrated on the so @-@ called end @-@ to @-@ end voice recognition model .
unlike the end @-@ to @-@ end model , the conventional voice recognition model includes the acoustic model and the language model .
the speeches are converted into texts via a deco@@ der after being processed by AM and L@@ M in sequence .
however , we have experim@@ ented with the end @-@ to @-@ end model for a long time .
at the beginning , our idea was to catch the sound waves and convert them directly into Chinese characters by our deep learning model .
this was a complete end @-@ to @-@ end model , but we met challenges on it .
although we achieved a higher accuracy rate on some test sets compared to the previous models , we encountered two challenges .
one is to recognize speeches mixed with English and Chinese .
nowadays when we speak , many of us are used to speaking Chinese with some English words , right ?
for example , many expressions like &quot; When will this &apos; iPhone &quot; be available on the market ? , &quot; &quot; Where does &apos; Angel@@ ab@@ ab@@ y &quot; shoot recently ? &quot; and &quot; S@@ ongs of &apos; T@@ F@@ boys &quot; &quot; have combined both Chinese and English words , which brings new challenges to the voice recognition technology .
the other one is to recognize new words .
for the deep learning model , once the output terminal is fixed , it cannot be changed or updated dynamically .
we used four to five thousand Chinese characters , but still failed to include the newly created Chinese characters .
so we made many technological explor@@ ations to solve this problem .
so far , we have made a new breakthrough in the end @-@ to @-@ end technology .
I briefly presented it at Baidu World Conference .
we changed the modeling unit from previous Chinese character unit to the current high @-@ frequency phon@@ eme unit .
as a result , our modeling ability was greatly improved .
we also overcame another problem . that is , if the modeling unit is small , it may easily cause over @-@ fitting during training .
by using the phon@@ eme modeling method , we have made great breakthroughs in voice recognition for Chinese or English speeches , natural utter@@ ances and randomly long speeches .
we will continuously optimize this end @-@ to @-@ end model , and we believe that it is a favorable trend of developing the voice recognition technology in the future .
so far , many competitors claim that their voice recognition rate is 97 % or 98 % .
in fact , this is for the near @-@ field voice .
the so @-@ called near @-@ field voice is just like how I speak right now .
the distance between the sound source and the receiver is less than one meter , and my voice is clear .
this is called the near @-@ field voice .
the near @-@ field voice technology has been optimized after constant technological breakthroughs in recent years .
here are some applications of the near @-@ field speech recognition .
I won &apos;t elaborate .
you can try the voice recognition on our Baidu Ap@@ p , Baidu Map , and T@@ alk@@ Type .
when you whisper , your voice will be accurately recognized even if your vocal cords do not vibr@@ ate .
this model is highly robust for the near @-@ field voice .
therefore , we think the near @-@ field speech recognition is sophisticated and advanced with high accuracy , although there are many different opinions on its accuracy and recognition rate .
the sole thing we need to do is to make horizontal applications based on the accurate near @-@ field voice recognition .
horizontal applications are our most important objective . they involve recognition of dial@@ ects , Chinese , English and other minority languages worldwide , as well as conferences and speeches .
at this point , creativity and intelligence of our developers are strongly appreciated .
so far , the near @-@ field voice technology is quite satisfactory , and we expect that it can be widely applied in different Ap@@ ps .
I want to talk a bit more about this .
so far , what degree has our near @-@ field voice technology reached ?
for example , we randomly pick some voice search queries from Baidu Ap@@ p .
the users are of different age groups and from different regions , so they have different acc@@ ents .
we randomly pick 50 queries and have some people and our online models listen to it .
if you randomly ask a person to compete with our online model , this person probably will fail .
our model would only fail if more than 20 people cooperated to challenge it .
under this circumstance , there is a chance that the model would fail .
the accuracy rate is high for near @-@ field voice recognition , and it shows the current status of the technology .
now let &apos;s take a look at some of our queries online .
let &apos;s listen .
&quot; Bo@@ on@@ ie B@@ ears . &quot;
the online query comes from the search engine .
so , it is a direct statement , and does not contain any context .
a single word or phrase suddenly comes out .
actually , this is a quite difficult scenario for context @-@ based voice recognition .
&quot; Bo@@ on@@ ie B@@ ears . &quot;
I wonder what you hear from this .
&quot; Bo@@ on@@ ie B@@ ears . &quot;
look .
this is a little kid searching for the cartoon .
let &apos;s listen to another one .
&quot; Bo@@ on@@ ie B@@ ears . &quot;
now it sounds like what it is .
however , if I play it to you suddenly , you may fail to understand it .
&quot; how to make B@@ raised Dong@@ po Por@@ k ? &quot;
I have heard that one of our audience already recognized it .
&quot; how to make B@@ raised Dong@@ po Por@@ k ? &quot;
&quot; how to make B@@ raised Dong@@ po Por@@ k ? &quot;
such queries fall into many different categories .
for example , we find that most children are searching for their expected cartoons .
&quot; a lot of Ul@@ tr@@ amen . &quot;
it &apos;s hard for ordinary people to recognize what a kid shouts suddenly .
&quot; a lot of Ul@@ tr@@ amen . &quot;
&quot; a lot of Ul@@ tr@@ amen . &quot;
I assume that we may still fail to recognize what it is even if we re@@ play it several times .
so this voice recognition technology is highly robust for the near @-@ field voice .
&quot; a lot of Ul@@ tr@@ amen . &quot;
we can understand it when listening to it at this time .
so we are highly willing to get such a voice technology available on ai@@ .@@ ba@@ id@@ u@@ .com .
there are mainly three aspects : recognition , synthesis , and wake @-@ up .
later , I will focus on our wake @-@ up technology , because we have the faith that our voice technology could help people &quot; wake up everything , &quot; and enable all devices to use our wake @-@ up words .
our Baidu is called &quot; Xia@@ od@@ u . &quot;
we can simply wake it , and then talk to it .
we knew that this technology was important when we get involved with it .
later , we further discovered that among the three aspects including recognition , synthesis and wake @-@ up , the most difficult technology is wake @-@ up , and we hold the same view even inside Baidu .
the best voice wake @-@ up is extremely hard to achieve , but it will be a very good experience for users .
there are a lot of collaboration cases .
I will not talk about all of them .
our platform has been established for quite a long time .
it currently bears heavy traffic .
therefore , we have accumulated many partners and enjoyed good cooperation with them .
we mentioned that we are going to open some technologies at Baidu Cre@@ ate this year .
we will fully open our technologies .
that is , we will not simply provide an online interface and ask you to use it directly .
instead , we will fully open these technologies from terminals to the cloud .
you can use our SD@@ K on your terminals .
we will enable your terminals to have excellent voice recognition and bar@@ ge @-@ in capability to cut off the voices properly , and send them to our cloud for more accurate recognition .
we will also get other aforesaid voice technologies available for you .
in addition , we will open our new voice contents , including some regional dial@@ ects , Chinese and English speech .
now , let &apos;s talk about our challenges and solutions for the voice technologies .
this is our newly launched voice recognition function for the call center .
we are also engaged in many projects for commerci@@ alization , and so we have optimized our model for the call center .
if you have related applications , you can use this technology .
okay , let &apos;s watch a video clip , it &apos;s a demonstration of a long speech .
please play it for us .
welcome to the AI Develop@@ er Conference .
I &apos;m very glad to demonstrate Baidu &apos;s voice technology .
our voice technology mainly consists of voice recognition , voice wake @-@ up , and voice synthesis , etc .
long speech recognition is also outstanding .
like my speech now , it can be recognized in real time , and it works with whispering too .
now I am in a meeting .
I will call you later .
the sound of singing can also be recognized .
let &apos;s listen to a part of the song The Road to Ordin@@ ary .
I &apos;ve crossed mountains and oceans , and wandered through crowds .
everything I once had faded away in the blink of an eye .
I was once frustrated and disappointed , lost all direction , until I saw that the only answer lies in the road to ordinary .
this handsome guy is our engineer , specializing in neural network language models .
you can take out your mobile phone , and use our Baidu Ap@@ p and Baidu &apos;s voice input method to have a try .
these two approaches are exactly the same .
at the last Baidu World Congress , we also introduced the technology that displays texts converted from real @-@ time speech .
because of limited time , I won &apos;t demonstrate it today .
now , I &apos;ll talk about some new scenarios and challenges that we have encountered .
these scenarios and challenges actually come from far @-@ field voice and voice wake @-@ up .
as I mentioned before , the modeling capability and data accumulation for near @-@ field voice recognition have reached a mature level .
however , they are different for the far @-@ field voice .
in far @-@ field , what &apos;s crucial is the capability of voice recognition .
far @-@ field refers to the distance beyond one meter , three meters or five meters .
some people believe it &apos;s beyond six meters or eight meters .
my microphone is in such a distance away from me , and I expect that you can recognize my voice when I speak .
this is similar to our conversations in daily life .
when we talk with people face to face , we feel comfortable at a distance from one meter away .
therefore , the first challenge is actually our capability of voice recognition .
echoes come from a far distance , and far @-@ field sounds bring echoes .
moreover , noises can easily come from a far distance .
so different noises and reverber@@ ations are mixed to weaken your capability of voice recognition .
in this case , we expect to have the capability to properly process signals of received sound waves .
this is not just a problem of voice recognition modeling , but a problem of whether you have a great signal processing capability .
and the hardware different from such a microphone is also involved and called microphone array .
it is a ring that can locate sounds , and can receive sound waves from a specific direction .
the quality of the received sound waves directly determines whether the recognition is accurate .
due to this new challenge , the core voice technology has gradually changed .
it used to only involve recognition .
but now it involves two parts .
one is digital signal processing , and the other one is voice recognition .
if you fail to get these two parts perfect , you may fail to achieve good voice recognition .
so it is a huge challenge for us .
another challenge is wake @-@ up .
the voice for wake @-@ up comes from a natural state of our daily conversation .
for example , if I want to talk with you , I will first call your name to get your attention .
the wake @-@ up function works in the same way .
our wake @-@ up word is &quot; Xiao Du . &quot;
if you don &apos;t say &quot; Xiao Du , Xiao Du , &quot; the speaker or remote controller will not respond to your voice .
according to our experience , it is extremely difficult to make this function perfect .
you have to put a huge amount of time and efforts in it for success .
first , the wake @-@ up function must be highly sensitive .
if you call me and I respond in one or two seconds later , you may think that I &apos;m stupid and not clever .
this is the same for devices .
if you call the name of a device and the device replies you in two seconds later , you may think that this is a really stupid device .
another serious challenge is false wake @-@ up .
that is , I do not call you , but you think that I &apos;m talking to you and start to recognize my voice .
then , a terrible experience comes from this incident , including chatting and playing songs in the middle of the night .
it is also difficult to solve the problem for false wake @-@ up because of various coming @-@ in sounds .
for example , if you turn on the television , you can hear various sounds from the TV program .
when you are at home , you may hear the sounds from cooking in the kitchen and voices from people in the living room .
we have this term called &quot; rejection , &quot; which means to reject recognition .
it is very difficult to achieve a higher accuracy rate for rejection .
now , we have achieved perfect functions for our best devices , but false wake @-@ up still happens about every other day .
it is really difficult to overcome this challenge .
in a noisy environment , we can guarantee that wake @-@ up occurs by mistake once in a two @-@ day period , and it reaches the extreme level for the existing technologies .
last year , we did two things only .
one is for far @-@ field recognition , and the other one is for wake @-@ up .
we have undertaken a great number of projects and made many technical innovations , and now we are satisfied with our technologies .
these are the challenges I said before .
it is not easy to overcome them .
however , according to our experience , you can achieve a great user experience if you do a good job .
that is , if you call it by name , it will say &quot; Master , what do you want to do ? &quot; or &quot; O@@ k , &quot; or &quot; Yes . &quot;
that &apos;s really great as you have a considerate assistant to serve you at any time .
what I have talked about may be not enough , because many technologies are involved .
so I &apos;d like to tell more about these technologies .
one of the difficulties for voice wake @-@ up is that you can &apos;t locate the sound source , because you do not know the direction of the coming sound .
therefore , you have to constantly collect sounds from all directions , and determine whether the collected sounds are the wake @-@ up words .
after being w@@ aken up , you can determine the source of the sound and start recognizing voices from the specific direction .
so , signal processing is one of the key technologies for the far @-@ field voice recognition .
another technology named &quot; Be@@ am@@ forming &quot; is about locating phon@@ em@@ es , and it is also crucial .
if you devi@@ ate even a little bit , your ability for collecting sound may get much worse at a distance from three or five meters away . as an old Chinese saying goes , &quot; a miss is as good as a mile . &quot;
in the past year , we made many technological innovations on how to eliminate noises and echoes by means of digital signal processing , and how to how to perfectly locate the source of a sound .
let &apos;s watch another a video .
please play it .
I &apos;m three meters away .
Xia@@ od@@ u , Xia@@ od@@ u .
I &apos;m here .
how &apos;s the weather today in Beijing ?
I &apos;m five meters away .
Xia@@ od@@ u , Xia@@ od@@ u .
hello !
what day is it today ?
today is Saturday .
I &apos;m six meters away .
Xia@@ od@@ u , Xia@@ od@@ u .
I &apos;m here .
what day is National Day ?
October 1 .
I &apos;m eight meters away .
Xia@@ od@@ u , Xia@@ od@@ u .
hello !
what &apos;s the time now ?
it &apos;s 17 : 32 .
I &apos;m ten meters away .
Xia@@ od@@ u , Xia@@ od@@ u .
I &apos;m coming .
play the song .
&quot; at Least I Have You &quot; of Sandy Lam .
we see that when the distances are six meters , eight meters and ten meters , our product manager has to shout .
the farther you get away , the more difficult it will be for the machine to locate the sound .
so it &apos;s really difficult to get this technology perfect .
however , we find a great user experience , because we keep a certain distance with people in the daily conversation .
right ?
in this way , you will feel that you are talking to a person instead of a device .
this is a brand new user experience .
&quot; listen to a quiet song for good sleep . &quot;
this is our data enhancement technology .
in order to achieve higher accuracy of far @-@ field recognition , we create enough far @-@ field data by adding the recorded impulse response function to the near @-@ field data .
the clip just played shows the near @-@ field voice added with the impulse response in the room .
we can listen to it .
&quot; listen to a quiet song for good sleep . &quot;
it sounds like a far @-@ field voice .
right ?
we have quickly converted the near @-@ field data of tens of thousands of hours into far @-@ field training data .
in this way , we ensure that our accumulated near @-@ field data can be used in our far @-@ field model .
&quot; listen to a quiet song for good sleep . &quot;
it is slightly different from the real voice .
another challenge comes from noise synthesis .
stringent requirements are proposed for the noises in a car , because the car is full of various noises , especially when you drive on an expressway .
regardless of an open or closed window or other situations , noises always exist , and so they need to be synthesized as well .
play a song of Jay Ch@@ ou .
the environment is quiet .
now we add the noises arising from a car into it .
play a song of Jay Ch@@ ou .
yes , like this .
we cooperate with manufacturers for the vehic@@ ular system , such as the rear @-@ view mirrors and the front d@@ ash@@ board .
in the future , we will find a variety of vehic@@ ular voice appliances with Baidu &apos;s voice recognition technology on the market .
recently , we have released the updated Baidu Map , which is fully hands @-@ free .
when using this Baidu Map , you don &apos;t need to hold it .
all operations are carried out by means of voice instructions .
this is our new technology .
this is what I talked about just now .
in addition , errors can be corrected according to the voice prompt for our input method , which was made available online long ago .
for example , if there is a typ@@ o , you can say that &quot; the Chinese character for &apos; B@@ ing &quot; in Fan Bing@@ bing &apos;s name is not the one indicating soldier in Chinese , but the one indicating ice . &quot;
then it will be changed to the right one .
at last , I &apos;d like to tell you that as developers , we will make our best efforts to develop perfect technologies of any kind .
and we are willing to get our technologies available for you , and we expect that you can get more use out of them .
we also appreciate your feedback , and will continue to make improvements .
thank you all !
well , that was a wonderful speech .
and I &apos;ll elaborate a bit more on the part of dialogue .
we can enter &quot; un@@ it.@@ ba@@ id@@ u@@ .com &quot; in the browser &apos;s address bar to reach the home page of the UN@@ IT platform , then click &quot; Use &quot; to open the actual background management page .
on the UN@@ IT platform , the range of tasks that a robot can handle is defined as a scenario .
generally speaking , one scenario corresponds to a robot that handles a specific task .
therefore , I will use &quot; robot &quot; instead of &quot; scenario &quot; later to make it easier to understand .
next , let &apos;s take a practical case as an example to see how to build a robot on our UN@@ IT platform to handle practical tasks .
okay , the first step , click &quot; New S@@ cen@@ ari@@ o &quot; and name the robot .
for example , we now name a robot as Hor@@ oscope Assistant , which helps people check their hor@@ os@@ copes .
then click &quot; confirm , &quot; and a null robot is created .
we can see a new row is added .
it &apos;s the dis@@ cription of this robot .
and it has some fields that dis@@ cri@@ bing the current state of the robot .
then click view to enter the configuration page of the robot .
robot configuration consists of three parts on the UN@@ IT platform .
the first is to define what the robot can do .
the second part is to define what knowledge should be taught to the robot so that it could understand human instructions .
the third part , robot to learn , digest and absorb the knowledge .
and I can verify online what capacities the robot has acquired and whether it has learned what we taught it as we expected .
each robot on the UN@@ IT platform is made up of a number of units .
well , as K@@ e @-@ san just said , it mainly consists of two parts .
one deals with dialogues , and the other deals with questions and answers .
because it &apos;s a simple scenario , hor@@ os@@ copes , I mean , so we just need to create one dialog unit .
of course you can assemble a variety of units to build a particularly complex robot .
a dialogue , by definition , involves at least one who asks and one who replies .
when we define what the robot can do , obviously we need to consider things .
one is what a user would probably ask for , and the other is under what circumstances the robot would reply .
for the user request part , did you notice the two concepts mentioned before ?
one is &quot; In@@ tention , &quot; and the other is &quot; slot . &quot;
&quot; intention &quot; refers to a task or a range of tasks that the robot is intended to do .
&quot; slot &quot; refers to conditions required by the task .
as for Hor@@ oscope W@@ id@@ get , obviously it is to offer hor@@ os@@ copes information .
we can simply call it L@@ UC@@ K @-@ SE@@ AR@@ CH , and give it an ali@@ as &quot; fortune teller . &quot;
in this way , the range of tasks has been clearly defined .
then ， the conditions . before we give out hor@@ os@@ copes , we need to know your star sign and what day &apos;s hor@@ oscope you want to read .
so we need two conditions , one is a star sign and the other is a date .
on the UN@@ IT platform , we realize this by creating slots .
for example , we are creating a condition like &apos; star signs &apos; , we can name it with this English word .
then , clarification , which means when a user does not clearly state his star sign , you can ask an extra question : what is your star sign ?
and then click &quot; Next . &quot;
we know that star signs are enum@@ erable .
there are 12 star signs .
therefore , we can upload a user dictionary in advance .
I won &apos;t show you the dictionary , which may includes 12 word lists .
and then click &quot; Next . &quot;
in this way , very simply , a slot of star signs is built .
the second slot is for dates .
but obviously dates are not as enum@@ erable as star signs .
if you follow the approach of our previous N@@ L@@ U tasks , you need to enumer@@ ate all dates , which is obviously impossible .
but for the convenience of users , UN@@ IT platform allows one to directly reuse the built @-@ in capabilities of our system .
so in the sa@@ ame way we create a condition called &quot; user _ date . &quot;
and the question would be &quot; what day are you interested in ? &quot;
as we see , UN@@ IT has many built @-@ in slots , such as movie names , person names , institution names .
users only need to check the box instead of uplo@@ ading their own slots .
for example , for Hor@@ oscope Assistant , I only need to select the built @-@ in sy@@ s _ time ， then click &quot; Next &quot; and &quot; com@@ firm . &quot;
in this way I have finished defining what users might ask .
our demonstration now might be a little too long .
in practice it takes about only one minute to define what users might ask .
then the second part is situ@@ ational response , that is , how the robot responds to a request .
now let &apos;s enter a simple sentence , &quot; OK , I &apos;ll check for you . &quot;
we know that when we are actually doing an application , we need to add the resource retri@@ val part in addition to the language understanding part .
for example , when checking hor@@ os@@ copes , obviously you are curious about the hor@@ oscope for a certain star sign on a certain day .
so before offering the service we have to collect all resources needed for the two conditions .
and if these two slots are indispensable , you have some way to set them on UN@@ IT .
here we provide a simple solution which can generate the conditions automatically with one click on &quot; smart generation &quot; instead of adding them one by one .
the two auto @-@ generated conditions indicate that only when a user has clearly stated the date and the star sign , the robot starts checking hor@@ os@@ copes
otherwise ， it responds by asking for clarification .
then click &quot; Save . &quot;
in this way , what the robot can do is defined .
to sum it up , we have defined what a user might ask , and the conditions under which the robot responds .
this is the first part , teaching the robot what to do .
secondly , I need to prepare some knowledge for the robot , which it learns in a particular way to understand what I am asking him to do .
in the interest of time , I &apos;ll upload a word list , uh , a sample prepared before .
OK , let &apos;s look at an example .
what does the robot need learn ?
to put it simple , hor@@ oscope is what we need to teach the robot when the user says &quot; I want to check my hor@@ oscope . &quot;
I need to tell the robot that the user &apos;s intention is to get his hor@@ oscope and no condition is stated .
we just need to save this after the anno@@ tation .
or the user might make it clear he want to check A@@ ries hor@@ oscope .
obviously what he intends is still to get hor@@ os@@ copes and one condition is A@@ ries .
similarly , if he intends to check today &apos;s hor@@ oscope , we just need to label &quot; today &quot; as a date condition .
if the user gives a complete sentence , &quot; I want to check tomorrow &apos;s T@@ aurus hor@@ oscope , &quot; then we just need to tell the robot that the user &apos;s intention is to get hor@@ os@@ copes and his two condition are T@@ aurus , the star sigh , and tomorrow , the date .
I annot@@ ated about ten samples to teach the robot how to respond accordingly when users say any of these ten sentences .
I am using the ten samples to illustrate what our UN@@ IT platform is capable of , that is , the robot can learn far more than the ten sentences after giving them the ten samples .
when we have defined what the robot need to do , in Unit Con@@ fig@@ uration , and have prepared knowledge in Data Center , the only thing left is to teach these knowledge to the robot .
on UN@@ IT platform we add a button &quot; Tr@@ ain and Val@@ idate . &quot;
select the sample that was uploaded just now , and click &quot; Tr@@ ain . &quot;
then the robot starts the learning process .
we are running out of time , so I &apos;ll show you the exact Hor@@ oscope Assistant we &apos;ve done before .
let &apos;s take a look at this .
its configuration is exactly the same .
the user request part and the robot response part are the same .
and in its data center , the same ten Sem@@ ple is used .
it has been successfully trained .
we will skip the machine training process .
now we can test what the robot have learned through these ten samples .
we can make a comparison .
what the robot has already learned is displayed on the right side .
we can add an example to the left .
for example , I say &quot; get hor@@ os@@ copes , &quot; which is obviously not from the ten samples .
but the robot has actually learned it ， hasn &apos;t he ?
the robot responds by asking &quot; what day do you mean ? &quot;
OK , and I say &quot; Next Saturday . &quot;
OK , we can see that the robot has not only known the intention , but also recognized next Saturday as the date .
and it asks &quot; what is your star sign ? &quot;
well , we add a reply , &quot; A@@ ries . &quot;
OK , in this way the slots are filled and an exact search is done , or in our terms , full@@ filled .
this is an example of a multi @-@ turn dialogue .
let &apos;s look at an example of a single @-@ turn dialogue to see how the robot would respond when we clearly state all necessary conditions in a single turn .
everyone can see these ten sentences clearly , right ?
get hor@@ os@@ copes .
get A@@ ries hor@@ oscope .
get today &apos;s hor@@ oscope .
for example , now the user says , &quot; Tell me next Sunday &apos;s Scorpi@@ o hor@@ oscope . &quot;
obviously I &apos;ve never given the robot this sent@@ ence.@@ But the robot under@@ stan@@ t@@ ds it , doesn &apos;t he ?
let &apos;s try this .
the robot can fully understand this sentence .
it knows that the user wants hor@@ oc@@ opes , his star sign is Scorpi@@ o and the date is next Sunday .
let &apos;s see what the UN@@ IT platform can do for developers for the input &quot; next Sunday . &quot;
it identifies next Sunday as a specific date , which is December 3 , 20@@ 17 .
you can check it out .
this is also a special feature of UN@@ IT .
the validation page ， as we see , is where developers check how well the robot works .
after the configuration , it provide a complete background service which can be called via API .
in addition , we have now opened up an access to Du@@ er@@ OS , our Baidu &apos;s operation system .
as long as you build a sen@@ ari@@ o , or build a robot , on UN@@ IT , you can submit it to Du@@ er@@ OS with one click .
of course Du@@ er@@ OS will review your submission .
once approved it will get into the Du@@ er@@ OS Sk@@ ills Store .
the Hor@@ oscope Assistant I just demonstrated has already been released in the Du@@ er@@ OS Sk@@ ills Store .
this is the configuration process of a simple scenario on the UN@@ IT platform .
well , now let &apos;s welcome K@@ e @-@ san .
OK .
thank you , Xia@@ oming !
uh , at last I will brief you our entire development process .
on July 5 we released the UN@@ IT platform .
and we made a lot of upgrades in four months .
actually on J@@ y@@ ly 5 we only released the understand ability of the dialogue unit .
and in early August we released our SD@@ K .
you can directly use our SD@@ K for voice capability .
actually we have an i@@ OS SD@@ K and an Andro@@ id SD@@ K .
in September , we launched the Q &amp; A unit .
and we released the share function .
then in October , we launched S@@ lot Reg@@ ul@@ arization , which means you no longer need to define slots by uplo@@ ding word lists one by one .
you can define slots using regular expressions .
in addition , our A@@ star contest concluded .
more than 700 teams participated , over 200 entered the final round , and 8 won prizes .
now here we are in November .
in this month , there are two things .
one is we launched &quot; submission to Du@@ er@@ OS , &quot; which means our two dialogue platforms , one ecosystem @-@ focused and one technology @-@ focused , have been integrated .
then on Baidu Cre@@ ate , we didn &apos;t have too many releases , but for financial Ser@@ iv@@ ces we announced a voice bank transfer function in cooperation with the Agricultural Bank .
and we announced Top Seller for smart customer service .
besides , our Q &amp; A robots for smart airport were also released there .
in fact we have been supporting ba@@ id@@ u &apos;s dialogue understanding tech@@ ol@@ ologies as its brain .
what comes next in December will be more interesting .
I can tell you now that first we will be able to support commercial deployment .
and next , we will release background management AP@@ Is , which allow you to pump word lists or to trigger training via API , in next month .
and our chat@@ bot , which you are waiting for , will be released next month .
then after December , next year , what I mentioned are scheduled in the first and second quarter .
and firstly , our Q@@ U and DM capabilities will have a major upgrade .
I will give you the specific details then .
now I would like to keep a secret@@ e .
secondly , for our training architecture , we will have a major upgrade concerning the stability of training and efficiency of validation , which is also scheduled in early next year .
and we will upgrade our data management capacity in the data center .
all these will be launched in early 20@@ 18 .
we have a lot more than these .
my project schedule is pages long .
I only picked out something that will come out soon .
all these capacities are coming soon , with the efforts of all our engineers .
our platform was lau@@ ched four months ago , but it is vigorous and growing rapidly .
and I hope that you could use it more and give us more comments and suggestions , which will help our platform to d@@ evel@@ p faster and better .
there were lots of functions , you know , that were from our developers &apos; feedback .
we scheduled them as quick as possible and made them happen .
the address of our UN@@ IT platform is un@@ it.@@ ba@@ id@@ u@@ .com .
you are welcome to visit and give it a try .
next , let &apos;s welcome Mr. Chen Jian@@ hao , C@@ TO of Ver@@ y@@ Star , an important partner of Baidu UN@@ IT , to share something wonderful with us .
please .
dear leaders , guests and AI developers , good afternoon !
welcome to Shanghai Station of Baidu AI Develop@@ er Camp - Cre@@ ate with AI .
I am Xia@@ od@@ u , your moder@@ ator today .
and I am very honored to participate in this event with you .
last month , Baidu AI Develop@@ er Camp was launched in Shenzhen , and later held in Chengdu and Hangzhou .
it fully presented Baidu &apos;s more than 80 AI @-@ inf@@ used functions , and officially launched its AI E@@ cos@@ ystem Partner Program called Li@@ ao@@ yuan for AI developers and partners .
today , senior AI engineers from Baidu came to Shanghai with Baidu &apos;s latest AI technologies to discuss the new cutting @-@ edge technologies with you for jointly creating a new era of artificial intelligence .
first of all , let &apos;s welcome Mr. Yu You@@ ping , general manager of Baidu &apos;s AI ecosystem division , to present Baidu Open AI Platform and Baidu &apos;s Li@@ ao@@ yuan Program .
well , thank you !
I &apos;d like welcome you all to the third stop of our camp .
I have a few things to share with you today .
the first thing I &apos;ll share with you is an overview of the strategies and ecos@@ y@@ tem of Baidu Open AI Platform .
then , we &apos;ll take a look at Baidu &apos;s AI @-@ inf@@ used capabilities .
the open platform takes pride in its ample AI @-@ inf@@ used functions .
I mentioned in Shenzhen last time that up till then the platform were able to offer 82 or 83 AI @-@ inf@@ used functions .
now , it can offer nearly 90 AI @-@ inf@@ used functions .
that means within just a month , the platform becomes much more capable .
so I &apos;ll walk you through these functions .
my co @-@ workers and our partners will elaborate on them later .
at the end of my presentation , I will introduce our Li@@ ao@@ yuan Program , because it &apos;s one of our key programs .
this time we are doing this series of events , at one hand , for our developers , in a hope that more developers will get to use Baidu AI .
on the other hand , which is also very important , we are doing this for our partners .
all those who use Baidu AI and help bringing AI to application are our partners .
we hope that all of them will work together with Baidu .
and we will offer all kinds of support , as much as possible , to help them grow .
OK .
let &apos;s take a look at this picture first .
it shows the whole picture of Baidu &apos;s open AI ecosystem .
it also embodies the strategy that Baidu has mentioned on various occasions , including the Baidu World Conference last week .
what is the core issue to be solved by this wave of artificial intelligence ?
it is to develop new computing platforms on which the cloud and terminals will be more intelligent .
the cloud is a new intelligent cloud for Baidu , in which there are lots of intelligent elements empowered by Baidu Brain .
there are also terminals .
this picture shows two largest terminals on which Baidu tends to realize its technologies in the AI era .
one is called Apollo , which is a open @-@ source operating system for vehicles .
the other is Du@@ er@@ OS .
Du@@ er@@ OS is an operating system for div@@ ices used in various scenarios including smart home , which , as we put it , &quot; awak@@ ens everything . &quot;
of course , Baidu Brain can also work on mobile phones , and new dev@@ ic@@ eds like cam@@ ar@@ as and robots .
I will talk about this later in detail .
we &apos;ll focus on Baidu Brain today .
yes , let &apos;s take a look at what Baidu Brain contains .
Baidu Brain , in short , is a collection of Baidu &apos;s AI technologies .
you may have heard a lot about AI technologies .
right ?
you have heard about AI on many occasions . right ?
you may have different understanding about AI .
however , there are some commonly used concepts when we talk about it .
first of all , the two most essential concepts in AI development and application are the perception layer and the cognition layer .
perception , corresponding to abilities of human eyes , ears and mouths , involves speech recognition and image recognition .
of course our speech capabilities also include speech synthesis .
then , our capabilities of Video and AR / V@@ R are actually extensions of image recognition and speech recognition .
when a computer is enabled with perception , the more important abl@@ ility needed is cognition , including natural language understanding , and better services based on knowledge graph and user portrait .
so these two core concepts , perception and cognition , are currently the two most important aspects of artificial intelligence .
of course , these capabilities are derived from the infrastructure in many aspects , such as data , algorithms , and computing power .
Baidu started search engine service a long time ago , which is a huge AI project .
with years of practice , Baidu &apos;s capabilities have become sophisticated .
and today we present all of them on Baidu Open AI Platform .
so we can take a look at the capacities available on Baidu Open AI Platform .
it can be seen that more than 80 capabilities are currently open .
these capabilities include speech , O@@ CR , which refers to optical character recognition , face recognition , human detection , image moderation , image recognition , video , natural language understanding , knowledge graph , AR , data intelligence , and the data set released at the latest Baidu World Conference .
above all these are our solutions for different scenarios and industries .
these solutions are concerned with specific problems in specific scenarios and are easy to integrate .
behind these capabilities , you can find P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle , a deep learning platform .
previously , you might have seen the video about peach classification based on P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle and the sign language .
right ?
they are actually not prevailing scenarios , and they cannot be solved by general capabilities .
more often , we need a relatively general deep learning framework like P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle to provide computing power , with which we could be able to solve specific problems concerning different data and scenarios .
next let &apos;s have a quick look at all those I &apos;ve just mentioned , including the deep learning fr@@ am@@ work and all of our technologies .
this page shows all the products and services currently available on our Open AI Platform .
you can see that there are quite a lot of them .
now , I &apos;ll briefly talk about P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
if you have have a basic understanding of deep learning , you may know that deep learning framework is the core of AI technology .
why is it so ?
we have accumulated a large number of methods through our work on deep learning , because there are a lot of methods concerning neural networks of deep learning , which can be consolidated into models .
then a deep learning framework is such an open @-@ source platform that share all these models .
now , Baidu is the only company that provides open deep learning framework in the industry in China .
compared with other deep learning frameworks in the world , Baidu &apos;s P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle has several features .
firstly , its community is rapidly expanding .
secondly , it is easier to learn and use .
thirdly , it will open more industry @-@ level applications .
it is noticed that the community activity of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle has grown remarkably , compared with the deep learning frameworks of other companies like Google , Amazon , Microsoft and Facebook , although P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle went open @-@ source merely one year ago .
such prominent growth has made us proud .
recently , it was mentioned a foreign article that Google intends to come back to China , bringing along their deep learning framework .
according to a Google survey , P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle in China has seen a remarkable growth in usage , over@@ taking T@@ ens@@ or@@ Flow .
now , I want to briefly talk about P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle Flu@@ id .
this is an important upgrade of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle we just announced last week at Baidu World Conference .
in fact , this upgrade results in a lower use cost of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
it is well balanced in easy programming , which means you can easily realize a deep learning model , and operational efficiency .
now as long as you are familiar with some basic algorithms in some high @-@ level programming languages , you can realize any capacity of the deep learning framework which used to be difficult .
moreover , abundant industry @-@ level models are opened by Baidu .
as we all know that industry @-@ many level models are repeated refined using massive data .
Baidu has fully open @-@ sourced these models .
we all know that the enterprises in China actually need to protect private data in a lot of their day @-@ to @-@ day scenarios , which gives rise to the application of these models .
however , considering the foundation of AI in China , we are less capable and put less effort in terms of data .
so we have open @-@ sourced many models , including CT@@ R estimation , recommendation , ranking , text classification , and etc .
for example , the peach sorting model we mentioned previously .
in fact , we have fully open @-@ sourced the model in the community .
that is , if you expect to make such a device for another peach orchard , you can use the existing model to do it within a short time .
of course , we are exerting our efforts in education .
yesterday , my colleague and I discussed how many people in China are capable of doing deep learning development .
and in my estimation the number might be somewhere around 2,000 .
however , such a talent reserve is far from enough to support the vigorous development of AI .
so now we are , together with a large number of institutions , doing a lot of work in preparing AI textbooks and courses .
we hope that we could train more professionals in this area .
this is actually a part of our Li@@ ao@@ yuan Program .
now we are also cooperating with some institutions .
now , I &apos;d like to briefly talk about some related technologies on our current platform .
the first is face recognition , because you may know more about face recognition .
when we talk about face recognition , you may think what it does is to recognize your face .
as a matter of fact , face recognition involves a bunch of compl@@ ec@@ ated technologies .
for ex@@ mam@@ ple , we opened 14 face recognition technologies , that is , we have 14 basic interfaces for face recognition .
and we need to choose the right ones according to real situations .
for example , face detection , face verification , face search and li@@ veness detection are some of the basic face recognition technologies .
I will not go into details .
you can learn them on our platform .
in addition to these basic technologies , we have also provided a lot of solutions , including the solution for face identification .
this is a solution for online face identification .
Lag@@ ou , one of our partners , will introduce how they apply face identification to identify those who post job vacancies on Lag@@ ou .
for example , we actually have had a taste of face sign @-@ in when we came in .
and the solution for face membership was mentioned in a pro@@ vious video clip .
today we have an announcement to make .
we decide to provide SMEs and developers our AF@@ R interfaces for free permanently .
yes , free @-@ of @-@ charge permanently .
for all users with developer accounts , we offer 2 free Q@@ PS for every interface .
yes , we no longer charge by API calls .
yes , free .
for enterprises that have completed the authentication of Baidu Cloud , each of our 14 interfaces allows 5 free Q@@ PS .
according to our investigation , 86 % users have a usage less than 5 Q@@ PS .
and for users who need more than 5 Q@@ PS , we charge for the extra part at a very low price , that is , 500@@ RMB per Q@@ PS per month , with industrial S@@ LA provided .
so we expect to popularize face recognition , which used to be high @-@ end and difficult in the past , and make it easily acquired by all our developers and partners , and widely applied in various products and innovations .
now , I &apos;d like to talk about our other technologies , such as the Optical Character Recognition technology .
undoubtedly , our O@@ CR technology is currently the best in the industry .
it has been evaluated by a large number of users .
in fact , O@@ CR is one of our products that have the fastest user growth .
we provide a variety of O@@ CR interfaces for character recognition on texts , cards and certificates , web pictures , spread@@ sheets , and receipts , etc .
I can show you a few examples .
the first example is the front page of a book .
you can see a very high accuracy .
it &apos;s all correct .
and the two in the middle are actually O@@ CR on web pictures , which might be exclusive to Baidu .
Baidu has accumulated rich experience through processing a large number of web pictures , and can do it well .
we also have O@@ CR on receipts , which is very difficult .
in the past , such an interface would cost a lot .
now , we open it with a high free quota .
we also have image recognition and moderation technologies .
we are engaged in online services .
right ?
lots of students have joined it for lean@@ r@@ ning .
so we undoubtedly have strong capability in image recognition and moderation .
so Internet companies can directly use our capacity , which is highly valuable .
moreover , we have offer reverse image search , which can be used in a veri@@ ety of scenarios in industry , agriculture , and online e @-@ commerce .
this is a platform which we released recently for customized image recognition .
this platform mainly deals with scenario @-@ based image recognition , so actually it is not intended for general use .
for example , the project , which we did with National In@@ stitutes for Food and Drug Control , for Chinese herbal medicine verification is actually a cou@@ stom@@ ized image recognition task .
so we now transform such a task , or such a scenario that requires recognition of specific images , into a product .
as long as you label some images , and upload them to this platform , we can help you train a model that meets your needs and scenarios .
we also have video processing technology , which incorporates capacities of O@@ CR , voice recognition , and image object recognition .
we also have voice recognition technology , which we open @-@ sourced three years ago .
it is the most open and cutting @-@ edge technology in the industry , it has been and will always be free of charge .
recently we launched long @-@ speech and far @-@ field @-@ voice recognition technologies , because there are more and more demands for long @-@ speech and far @-@ field @-@ voice recognition .
there are huge demands for far @-@ field voice recognition in enterprise applications , for example , in scenarios such as intelligent customer service , robots and smart homes .
we also have the capability of voice synthesis .
Xia@@ od@@ u , our moder@@ ator , is ac@@ ually an application of the voice synthesis technology .
and we have voice w@@ ake@@ up , which is a technology mainly used in scenarios such as vehicles and homes .
these are some of our partners who use our voice technology .
they are actually from a veri@@ ety of industries .
now I &apos;d like to talk about our natural language processing .
as we all know , N@@ LP is the core capability for a search engine .
we have more than 30 N@@ LP operators .
so far , we have opened the eight most frequently used operators .
these operators have enabled best N@@ LP interfaces in the industry .
and we have UN@@ IT , which will be presented later by my colleague .
it is actually a platform for chat@@ bot training , which is highly valuable .
developers or enterprises who work on robots , intelligent customer service or smart conversation should pay more attention to this .
and we have this robot vision solution , which we announced previously in Chengdu , right ?
there are so many application scenarios in the active fields of robots .
we have released quite a lot commonly used capacities on our platforms .
of course we have more , for example , the open platforms of augmented reality , machine translation , and data intelligence .
recently we rolled out Baidu B@@ road , a dat@@ as@@ et platform of Baidu .
all we do is intended to serve the whole ecosystem , our partners , and developers .
because we see the most essential point is that the AI technology will be applied as a fundamental technology , or an revolutionary technology to various aspects and fields .
it is impossible for Baidu to implement AI technology in so many fields .
we need to open these capabilities , so that more developers and enterprises can create more by making a full use of the AI technology .
this is the overall strategy when we are doing all these .
we all know that artificial intelligence may be the greatest wave in the future 10 , 20 or 30 years .
so Baidu firmly holds its open strategy and expects to help friends from all industries .
of course , we also provide a good environment for many students , developers and practitioners to develop , learn and communicate .
for example , we have an AI community on our Open AI platform .
now , many questions in our AI community are answered by users .
I recently have been giving presentation at universities .
lots of students have joined it for lean@@ r@@ ning .
and lots developers are communicating there .
some even found jobs there .
so this is a pretty good environment .
and P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle also have a section for discussion on G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b , the sou@@ ce code management platform .
all I &apos;ve mentioned are the technologies and product capabilities Baidu offers to the AI ecosystem .
but we think that we have not done enough , because many partners told me , &quot; we wanted to do some business . but our brand is not so recognized . people don &apos;t trust me , and don &apos;t think that I can get the job done . &quot;
for example , we recently contacted a university in northern China .
it intended to apply face recognition in dormit@@ ories and can@@ teens .
our partner has the capability for implementation , and we have the brand and technology .
so we gave them an endorsement .
we worked with them to formulate a proposal , and helped them to realize it .
then , our partner won the customer and scenario .
well , this is what we expected .
we launched Baidu AI E@@ cos@@ ystem Partner Program about one month ago in Shenzhen , and we called it Li@@ ao@@ yuan , con@@ not@@ ating the idea that a single spark could kin@@ dle a whole prairie , just like what we expect from our program .
in this program , we expect to deliver not only our technologies and product capabilities , but also our resources regarding customers , marketing , enterprise operation and investment support , to help our customers grow .
we plan to implement this program in two stages .
the customers who need Baidu &apos;s AI technology services can apply to become our AI eco @-@ partner , and we can support them in many aspects .
we will select excellent companies to get into our AI accelerator , and provide them with support in investments and operation courses , etc .
we have released the program for nearly one month .
now , we have received a large number of applications .
our first AI accelerator is expected to be officially launched in Beijing on December 7 .
and you can see that that we have provided a lot of support for our partners .
we will also categor@@ z@@ ie these partners , and provide them with support in many aspects , such as technical resources , joint branding and customer sharing .
for the partners admitted into our AI accelerator , we will provide them with customized courses , or even funds , and more in @-@ depth technological support .
well , this camp will open in December .
you can also scan the Q@@ R code to see the overall program for our partners .
so far , there are dozens of partners who have applied for it after we announced the Li@@ ao@@ yuan Program .
in Beijing we may make a comprehensive demonstration of the current status of our ecosystem .
to sum up , we expect to build a most open , well @-@ rounded , and fai@@ rest AI ecosystem .
we expect to work with 500 eco @-@ partners , and train 5000 deep learning engineers .
we will select 60 start @-@ up companies to get into our accelerator , and invest in more than 10 AI start @-@ up companies .
this is our commitment to the industry and the ecosystem .
we really hope that what we have done can benefit the entire industry , push forward the application of AI in China and make continuous progress .
OK ！
please follow Baidu Open AI Platform , and join us to realize AI in our everyday life .
thank you all !
hello , everyone , I am an algorithm engineer from P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle team .
my demo is a bit more down @-@ to @-@ earth .
we will do it through command lines , but it is not going to be too complicated .
it &apos;s actually a script I wrote before , which basically consists of one @-@ click commands .
today we will show you three exam@@ pl@@ es.@@ They are relatively simple .
all of them are from P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle open source community .
if you are interested , you may pull them from P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle open source community after the conference and have a test on your local machine .
the results you get should be the same as mine today .
we start with the first demo .
the first demo is intended for prediction of house prices in a certain area .
as everyone knows , house prices are determined by various factors , such as the location .
it matters whether you buy an apartment near West Lake or in the suburbs .
other factors such as the air quality in that area also matter .
here , we use the house price data in Boston to train the model for such predictions .
first , let &apos;s see what the data look like that we will feed into the model .
you can see that there are two charts here .
the one on the left is the raw data that we will feed into the machine .
it consists of fourteen columns , and each row is a piece of data .
in the first thirteen of them are the data features that we &apos;ve just talked about , every one of which is described in this chart on the right .
the four@@ teenth column contains the actual house prices arranged according to these features .
we feed these data into the model , it will be trained through iter@@ ations , then it will find out a certain relationship between these features and the actual house prices .
then , after multiple iter@@ ations , the model is capable of capturing such a relationship .
then , when we feed new data into the model , it will output a price that it thinks a corresponding apartment could have .
we can do some training and see how such a model training process works .
after we have started the training , it will iter@@ ate for numerous times .
every Pass means that an iteration on every piece of data .
on the right , we have a real @-@ time iteration of training , and on the left , it outputs the Bat@@ ch , and it outputs the Cost .
the Cost is the loss from the objective function for the data .
the lower the loss , the better .
from this chart on the right , you can see a real @-@ time demo of our training process .
after the training is completed , it will save the intermediate results after every 10 passes of training , then we can choose a pass that shows better training results , or parameters , as our predictive model .
we can see that the output models are here .
there are nine in total because one model was saved for every 10 passes , starting from zero .
now here we select the model we &apos;ve saved from the for@@ tieth pass , and use it to predict on our new data .
let &apos;s see what our new data look like .
we can see that the prediction results are in the same format as our training data .
in the first three columns are features , and in the last column are the real values .
we randomly pick one of these rows , this one for example , for prediction , to see what our model will output .
Oh , something is wrong !
our actual house price is , we can see from here , our actual price is 13.@@ 4 , and the price we predicted is 13.@@ 89 .
this result is relatively satisfactory since house prices fluctu@@ ate quite drastically .
from 13.@@ 0 , as we see now , to 16.@@ 0 , this margin of error is acceptable .
let &apos;s look at another one .
we can see that the actual price is 14.@@ 1 , and the price we output is 14.@@ 72 .
there is a little difference , but it is generally acceptable .
of course , our training data seem insufficient .
when we have more training data , the prediction results should be better .
this is just the first example of our demo .
if we think broadly , we can not only predict house prices but also predict other things , for example , stock prices in scenarios like green investing that has gained in popularity in recent years .
so , can we predict stock prices using such a model ?
I believe so .
if you can collect some features affecting stock prices , put them together into a big training dat@@ as@@ et and train the model , then we may make predictions on stock prices .
it &apos;s worth a try .
next , we are going to show the second demo , which will be more interesting .
the second demo is Chinese poetry generation .
it it an interesting application that appeared recently .
you all might have tried it before .
when I input a poem line , it will output the next line , or give you an ac@@ ro@@ stic .
let &apos;s look at how such application is realized .
we may first look at some of its training data .
OK , this one , let &apos;s adjust it a bit ...... let me look at this training data .
now the data is like this .
it has two columns .
the first column is what we feed into the machine , and the second column is what we want the computer to output .
they are taken from some classical poems .
when we feed these data to the machine , it will find out data distributions .
and when it has been trained for enough times , it will have a certain degree of understanding .
then , when we input new data that is not in the training set , it can also output a relatively good sentence .
let &apos;s see how well it works .
such training takes time , so since we have limited time here , we are going to use a model that has been trained before to show what it will output .
let &apos;s look at what the input data look like .
they are like this .
you can see that they are some lyrics from Chinese rap songs , and they are rhythmic .
then we input these data into the model , and see what kind of sentences it will output .
since this model is large , it takes time to load for the first time .
of course , in the second time , we can reuse our model .
so , in general , the prediction is quite efficient .
we may try something randomly .
for example , I &apos;ll input this sentence and see what our machine will output for us .
here the machine outputs five rows .
there are two columns .
in the first column are the scores , and in the second are the output sentences .
the scores reflect the quality of the sentences .
the higher the score , the better the quality .
we can see that such results are quite good .
the machine has indeed learned something .
they are somewhat rhythmic .
next , let &apos;s look at another one .
as you can see , it is quite good .
this indicates that through training the machine has grasped a certain distribution in sentences .
so , in this case , when we give new inputs , it will output some satisfactory results .
based on this , we may think broadly .
are there other scenarios for this application ?
I would first think of applying it to smart conversation .
smart conversation is like this , for example , when I say a sentence , I expect the machine to give me some feedback .
this could be in a form of a chat , or Q &amp; A .
or for example , I can make a smart writing assistant .
it works like this .
when you get stuck during writing , you can input a sentence , the model will provide you with some candidate results .
from them you may choose some that you think are appropriate .
of course , scenarios are not limited to these .
there are others .
you may think broadly and see if there could be other scenarios for application .
next , we are going to present the third example .
in the third example , I will input an image into my model , and I expect that it will outline , or detect the objects of interest in this image .
the objects may be , for example , a cat , a dog , a car or a train .
it can not only recognize them but also locate them precisely in the image .
let &apos;s look at how its training data look like .
the training data are labeled .
for example , in the first image , there are two cats .
they are not only labeled as cats but also annot@@ ated with their specific position information .
and in the second image , which is more complex , there are a lot of chairs .
these chairs are different from each other , and the background is also more complex .
in the third one , there are a man and a horse , and the fourth one , a car .
so , after we have labeled them and marked their positions , we feed these data to our model .
after iterative training , the model will capture some features of the objects in these images .
then , when we input a new image , it can outline the objects of interest in the image .
since this involves images , it takes a long time to train .
here , to save time , we &apos;ve also prepared the model in advance .
we are going to show how the pre @-@ trained model works on a new image input .
these are the images we are going to feed into the model .
these are some of the paths .
and we expect that the model will outline the objects of interest in the image .
now we are going to run it .
now the model is loading .
the model is large and involves many layers , like the conv@@ olution layer and the po@@ oling layer , as well as some other complex operations .
after the model is loaded , we may input the image .
I &apos;ll input the previous one .
you can see that the image on the left is the one we feed into the model and the image on the right is the output from the model .
here , we can see a man and a horse , which have been correctly outlined and recognized with the confid@@ ences of 0.@@ 9@@ 48 and 0.@@ 9@@ 99 .
the confid@@ ences are very high , so they &apos;ve been outlined .
there are also objects with low confidence , so in the middle of the process , they were discarded .
of course , there are different horse breeds .
for example , there are also different breeds in our training data .
although this one might not be included in the training data , the model can still outline it .
let &apos;s see the next one .
this is a train .
the train is quite long .
but based the distributions learned from our training data , our model can also accurately outline an object like the train in the image .
although the train is quite long , it is outlined with a relatively high confidence .
the train can be detected .
how about a car ?
there is quite a difference between cars and trains .
let &apos;s see how well it does on cars .
as you can see , there are two cars in the input .
you might not notice there is another car at the far end .
of course , our model still outlines it with a confidence of around 0.8 , which is quite high .
you may wonder why we , human , might not notice the car at the far end , but the machine can detect it and give it a relatively high confidence .
please look carefully . the car on the far end has two wheels standing out .
it is possible that in the training set , the model has a high response to car wheels .
so in this case , it can still outline it and give it a relatively high confidence .
you may ask &quot; there are also a traffic light and a house in it , and why they have not been detected ? &quot;
that is because they are not in our training data .
you may feel that these images are relatively simple .
they are indeed not complex .
so , we are going to input a more complex image and see what the model can do .
you can see that there are a lot of things in the image .
there are two people , one bottle and one table .
the model still outlines them with relatively high confid@@ ences .
the table gets a 0.@@ 4@@ 05 , which is relatively low , but it is also acceptable .
you may think that these are simple applications .
maybe we can think broadly . are there any other application scenarios ?
I &apos;ve just thought of one . we can do explosive detection .
for example , if I &apos;m from a security agency , and I want to check and ensure no guns in any image passing through my router .
anyone with a gun might be a terrorist or even carry explosives .
so , we can create such a dat@@ es@@ et , a collection of data of guns and explosives .
then we train the model .
after the training , if any image that contains guns or explosives is input into the model , it will be detected .
this will save considerable money on labor costs .
so , that &apos;s all for my demo .
these are relatively simple examples .
of course , if you have more complex tasks , P@@ add@@ le@@ Pad@@ s@@ dle also provides a rep@@ o P@@ addle Model .
you can visit it and see if there are any models that suit you .
to end this presentation , I &apos;d like to do an advertisement .
our P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle offers a variety of services for developers .
if you are a beginner and don &apos;t know much about deep learning or machine learning , you can visit our P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle Book .
it has eight chapters , and they start from the basics then gradually go deeper .
also , if your tasks are even more complex , we also have a rep@@ o &quot; Model@@ s . &quot;
you can have a look in models to see if there are any models that you need .
in that way , P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle can work not only for Baidu but also for all AI developers .
I hope more and more people will join P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle and continue to make P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle the most significant and most reliable open source community in China or even around the world .
thank you .
good afternoon , everyone !
I &apos;m Luo Tao from the P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle Team .
today , let me introduce Baidu &apos;s large @-@ scale distributed deep learning framework - P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
usually , AI developers have a preferred framework , so P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle is very important to Baidu .
P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle is to Baidu what T@@ ens@@ or@@ Flow is to Google , and Ca@@ ffe@@ 2 to Facebook .
it is a framework that Baidu strongly supports and fully promotes .
P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle framework was first established in 20@@ 13 , and then used for Baidu &apos;s deep learning application and research .
after three years of development , it was open @-@ sourced in September 20@@ 16 , and now it has been open @-@ sourced for one years and two months .
now , the company attaches great importance to our P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
Mr. Lu Qi , our CO@@ O , has stressed in many occasions that all machine learning and deep learning platforms of our company should be unified into P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
the business platform should be fully transferred to P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle , and the technology platform should be shared to P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
as developers working at the front@@ line of the platform , we &apos;re under huge pressure .
we need to make P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle as good as possible , so the platform could better support the needs from various applications within the company .
in addition , many people have asked us whether Baidu has an internal version of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle that is different from the public version .
here , I can tell you that P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle does not have an internal version .
we also use the public version on G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b , an open source community .
therefore , please feel free to use P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
we have the determination as well as the ability to make it an excellent platform , and we will never hide anything for our own good .
for P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle , we are building it into the best deep learning platform in China , that &apos;s our short @-@ term goal .
our medium and long @-@ term goal is to compete with the world top deep learning frameworks such as T@@ ens@@ or@@ Flow and Ca@@ ffe@@ 2 .
the opening of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle is actually an opening of four major elements of the development of artificial intelligence technology , including framework , large @-@ scale computing , big data and applications .
first , I &apos;ll talk about the framework .
framework is the core element , which defines the whole process of deep learning , including data preparation , model training , prediction and deployment .
the framework of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle are being continuously optimized and improved .
at present , we are re@@ factor@@ ing P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle , trying to present a more user @-@ friendly and more efficient framework for users .
P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle will be combined with cloud computing technology , through which , we hope that developers can enjoy Baidu &apos;s large @-@ scale computing capability , then ordinary developers can also conduct large @-@ scale model training .
the third element is open data .
we know that data is crucial for machine learning and deep learning , sometimes even more important than model itself .
therefore , we will work with our partners to open some data that was inaccessible before .
developers will be able to use the data for free .
the fourth element is large @-@ scale application .
large @-@ scale application means industrial @-@ level application .
we will open some model configurations for scenarios frequently using deep learning .
even , we will train some models , and put them on the platform so that users could use their own data to deliver applications they want .
in this way , the R &amp; D of AI technology will be accelerated .
first , I &apos;ll introduce the open application model library of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
we can see that there &apos;s a rep@@ o called models maintained under the official path of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
here we &apos;ve stored some frequently used deep learning models , for example , the CT@@ R prediction and learning @-@ to @-@ rank models in the first line .
the CT@@ R prediction model evaluates the reach rate , while the learning @-@ to @-@ rank model ranks search results .
both models are relevant to Baidu &apos;s core revenue business .
please look at the AS@@ R in the second line .
the AS@@ R Project was developed based on a speech recognition project initiated by Andrew Ng when he was in Baidu .
this project achieves pretty good recognition rate even in noisy scenario .
now , we &apos;ve open @-@ sourced it .
we hope users could use the model to train their own AS@@ R models .
at the same time , we will train a good model with tens of thousand of hours of voice data in Chinese and English and open .
as for this AS@@ R project , we plan to make it independent from the rep@@ o of models , and to promote and maintain it as an independent project .
in the third line , we can see some applications of text processing , including text classification , text generation and machine translation .
applications of text @-@ processing have always been one of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle &apos;s advantages .
because Baidu has quite a lot text @-@ related business .
therefore , P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle has always been performing out@@ stand@@ ingly in sequence @-@ to @-@ sequence learning .
P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle will have specific optimization for some common R@@ N@@ N units , including L@@ ST@@ M , GR@@ U and dual @-@ way structure .
P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle also supports ne@@ sted two @-@ layer R@@ N@@ N structure , thus it &apos;s able to support more complex text structures .
in addition , our R@@ N@@ N adopts a computing method without p@@ adding , so its computing power is one to two times stronger than that of T@@ ens@@ or@@ Flow .
for more details , you can visit our benchmark on G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b , where we &apos;ve posted a chart of performance comparison .
we opened those models for we hope that when users are training or designing their deep learning algorithms , they could go to our Rep@@ o and find similar applications .
thus , they only need to prepare their own data and modify models slightly , next they could train models rapidly , then start iterative development and speed up application .
for text classification and image detection , my fellow colleague Mr. Zhao Cheng@@ du@@ o will bring us a workshop for demonstration .
many applications of models are inspired by Baidu &apos;s lines of business or prototype algorithms in some academic theses .
we &apos;re glad to see that some developers have managed to make a difference by using P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
this is an intelligent peach sor@@ ter for peach farmers , which is invented by some undergraduates from Beijing University of Technology .
let &apos;s watch a video first .
play the video , please .
my family has been growing peach trees since my grandfather .
in busy seasons , we can &apos;t handle all of the trees and have to hire some part @-@ time workers .
they are less @-@ experienced , so they could just do some auxiliary work .
when talking with peach farmers , we realized that they always put too many efforts in the classification process .
we learned from the news that Baidu &apos;s AF@@ R technologies are pretty cool , so we decided to develop an au@@ omatic peach recogn@@ izer .
we &apos;re familiar with mechanical control , but the deep learning stuff seemed formidable to us .
so we searched on the Internet and found that P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle could meet our demands .
through learning the tut@@ ot@@ ri@@ als on the open source platform P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle , we trained our own model and used it for peach sorting .
however , the accuracy rate of our sorting was a bit low .
we put forward this problem on G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b and got some help from P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle Community , achieving a great result .
the whole device comprises four parts : conveyor , a pushing and pulling device , control circuit , and a main@@ frame .
the main@@ frame is for running P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle &apos;s algorithms .
after properly trained , the elements that the image classification algorithm can extract are much more rich and comprehensive than that from manual classification .
the more training the machine gets , the more data are accumulated , the more accurate the sorting and classi@@ fying will be .
over these years , we have seen that some high technologies have been used in traditional industries , which could solve many practical problems .
we hope that this new technology could be applied in Kenya to help farmers with smart sorting of vegetables and fruits .
the peach sor@@ ter invented by Beijing University of Technology could lower labor cost .
we used to sort pe@@ aches by hand , now we can use machine to do the heavy work , it really helps us a lot .
what will they invent in the future ?
automatic picking robots , packaging robots , which will help us a lot more in the future .
that &apos;s all of the video .
this is a typical example of how AI changes a traditional industry .
from this video , we see that the undergraduates from Beijing University of Technology utilized P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle and brought actual benefits to peach farmers , letting people in the traditional industries gain from the development of AI .
as for these students from Beijing University of Technology , they don &apos;t have any background in deep learning .
they don &apos;t know much about image classification , what they are good at is mechanical control .
for professional AI developers , what they see is probably just an image , a simple image classification problem .
however , it &apos;s very hard for these undergraduates .
but by using P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle they could quickly train an image classi@@ fier , which tells whether a peach is of good or bad quality .
then they could focus on mechanical control that they &apos;re good at , and integrate technologies on P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle into their device .
we really appreciate this kind of effort , and we encourage people to do the same .
we also help these under@@ gradu@@ ages a lot with their research and development .
we hope that more people could join us , together we can use AI technology to bring more innovations to traditional industries .
besides the open application model library mentioned before , we will also open some large @-@ scale data .
we will work with teams from Baidu and some external partners to open some large @-@ scale data together .
these data includes tens of thousands of hours of voice recognition data we talked about earlier , and some data mentioned in this P@@ PT slides , such as processed traffic data , and some text data from Baidu .
we &apos;ve always been pushing and implementing these plans .
we hope to build an integrated open platform of algorithms plus computing plus data .
through the opening , we hope that ordinary developers could get access to cutting @-@ edge research subjects .
after having models and data , the biggest challenge faced by individual developers , as well as small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , is the lack of computing resources .
not all developers and small and medium @-@ sized enterprises have the ability to maintain the expensive G@@ PU clusters .
a G@@ PU server with four P@@ 40 chips costs RMB 200,000 , then the maintenance for a cluster of ten G@@ PU servers could cost more than one million RMB .
P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle solves this problem through the combination with Cloud computing technologies .
what we are doing now is to define a P@@ addle Cloud general computing cluster .
it adopts Ku@@ ber@@ net@@ es distributed operation system .
via the services on P@@ addle Cloud , users could prepare data , train models , make predictions and deploy applications .
it &apos;s a one @-@ stop service .
users could im@@ por@@ ve their models based on data they obtained , then accelerate the development of AI through continuous iter@@ ations .
here I &apos;d like to point out that P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle is the first open @-@ sourced deep learning framework that officially supports Ku@@ ber@@ net@@ es .
in the same way , we &apos;re maintaining a Cloud Rep@@ o under the official path of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle , specifically for this general computing cluster .
in addition , we &apos;ve got the National Engineering Laboratory for Deep Learning Technology and Applications .
the laboratory was established in Baidu early this year .
led by Baidu , the laboratory was built in collaboration with Tsinghua University and Beijing University of Aer@@ onau@@ tics and Astr@@ onau@@ tics .
this means a recognition at the country level for Baidu &quot; efforts in deep learning .
so this platform needs to open deep learning technology , algorithms , hardware , data , models and so on .
meanwhile , the only deep learning framework supported by this platform is P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
I &apos;ve mentioned the opening of four elements of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle before .
they will be available on the platform simultaneously .
here we list some important links .
the first one links to core codes of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
it &apos;s a place for our code research and development .
the second one , P@@ addle Cloud general computing cl@@ us@@ eter .
the third one is models , the open application model library .
the fourth one is some of our works for mobile terminals , mainly for model prediction acceleration on mobile terminals .
I am not going into details here .
if you &apos;re interested , please visit the link to try P@@ addle Mobile .
your comments are welcomed .
you guys must be curious about how our P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle team work .
we are quite a special team inside Baidu .
we work in a different way from other teams , because we are probably the only team in Baidu that focuses on open @-@ sourcing .
we had a flat organizational structure with little hierarchy .
we organize people according to tasks .
so this is how we work : if we have an idea , like improving an algorithm or developing a new function , we will post a PR on G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b for our design document .
then we will invite friends in the community for review and discussion .
if the idea is found problematic , unreasonable , or nobody wants to do it , the PR will be closed .
if the idea is agreed to be good , reasonable , and commonly understood , we will proceed to breakdown the work .
normally we will have one or more people on the task .
after task assignment , we &apos;ll start to code .
once the coding is completed , we need to merge the codes with our trunk .
next we make some pull requests regarding the merge of codes , then invite those who are familiar with this part to review .
after re@@ viewers give their comments , the programmer will modify their codes based on the comments until all re@@ viewers have no problem with it , then we could merge the work with the trunk .
we really hope that everyone here could be a contributor to P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
the smart peach sor@@ ter we talked about before is a very good example .
besides , when we were working on the AS@@ R project Deep Speech 2 , some developers showed great enthusiasm .
each time we opened new codes , they would pull and test them , and give us suggestions .
sometimes they would even make pull requests to us .
we &apos;re very glad to see such developers and encourage what they do .
besides individuals , developers at the enterprise level are welcome to join us too .
this July , we had our first enterprise level developer - Intel .
in AI era , we know that the computing power of G@@ PU is crucial .
in the wave of AI development , Intel was once at a disadvantage .
but in recent two years they tried to catch up .
they had some major acquisitions , meanwhile they opened M@@ K@@ L @-@ D@@ N@@ N , a library for accelerating deep learning on CPU .
it &apos;s a con@@ ter@@ part of N@@ V@@ ID@@ IA cu@@ D@@ N@@ N .
Intel hopes that M@@ K@@ L @-@ D@@ N@@ N could be integrated into the mainstream deep learning frameworks .
they tried to integrate the library into C@@ affe and have also done a lot of optimization work there .
if you &apos;re interested , please search the Intel C@@ affe Project in G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b .
however , for some reasons , the base was not integrated into C@@ affe official framework .
so they came to us this July for cooperation .
since then , Intel has contributed almost 10,000 lines of codes to us .
what we achieved through cooperation is that the V@@ G@@ G network trained using M@@ K@@ L @-@ D@@ N@@ N runs three to four times faster on Intel Sk@@ yl@@ ake than the network trained only using M@@ K@@ L .
for related links you can have a look at our Ben@@ ch@@ mark .
P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle is the first deep learning framework that officially supports M@@ K@@ L @-@ D@@ N@@ N .
our collaboration with Intel has also accelerated some performances of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle on CPU .
thank you for your attention and support to P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle open source community !
this is a great era , in which the AI technologies develop with each passing day .
we hope that everyone here could learn and grow from the development of AI , realizing your own value .
if you are already using P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle , keep going .
your comments are welcomed .
if you haven &apos;t tried P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle yet , please give it a try .
I believe you &apos;ll benefit a lot from it .
above is a general introduction .
how about the application cases of the open model library ?
next we will have my col@@ leg@@ ue Zhao Cheng@@ du@@ o to give us an introduction .
it &apos;s your time , Cheng@@ du@@ o .
welcome Cheng@@ du@@ o !
good afternoon , everyone !
my presentation today has two parts .
the first is a general introduction of Baidu Open AI Platform .
the second is about our recently @-@ launched Baidu AI E@@ cos@@ ystem Partner Program .
as we know , Baidu launched its business by develop@@ ping search engine , and we have spent more than a decade in the R &amp; D of AI .
our comprehensive layout of AI technologies started to take shape around seven or eight years ago with our efforts on N@@ LP , voice technology , machine learning , image technology , etc .
now , We have a complete layout of AI technologies .
based on the layout , we unveiled the strategies of Baidu &apos;s open AI ecosystem at Baidu Cre@@ ate in July .
as a complete ecosystem , it includes two parts , the cloud and the terminals .
Baidu Cloud is a colossal computing platform .
it is available not only within Baidu , but also to our developers and partners as a basic support platform .
Baidu Brain , backed by Baidu Cloud , offers various AI @-@ inf@@ used capabilities and is the core of Baidu &apos;s AI .
above the brain is vertical solutions and ecosystems , such as Du@@ er@@ OS .
based on voice technology and N@@ LP , Du@@ er@@ OS is a next @-@ generation natural language @-@ based human @-@ computer interaction OS , aiming at industries such as smart home .
next is Apollo .
Apollo , an open plat@@ fo@@ m for smart driving technologies and elements , aims at the automotive industry .
the whole strategy features two key words : one is openness , and the other is ecosystem .
we expect to achieve a strategic goal by opening up every layer and building them jointly with our partners .
now I will briefly introduce Baidu Brain .
Baidu Brain is the technological layout of Baidu AI technologies .
the basic layer incorporates data , algorithm and computing platform .
it is essential to Baidu Brain .
what is perception layer ?
take human for example . the perception layer is to Baidu Brain what the visual and auditory perception are to us .
these abilities allow us to directly perceive the outside world .
the other layer features cognition , which is an ability unique to human .
it includes linguistic competence , the abilities of understanding , dig@@ esting , summarizing , and applying knowledge , and the ability of understanding one another .
on top of these is the Open AI Platform , which is the source of all AI @-@ inf@@ used functions .
it un@@ folds all the functions from the layers below .
with Baidu Brain , we hope to shape a virtuous eco @-@ circle by jointly building a technological platform with partners from all industries .
we hope that innovative applications could flourish in this ecosystem , which could benefit us all with AI @-@ inf@@ used cap@@ abil@@ ites .
OK , next I will talk about Baidu Open AI Platform in detail .
up to now , this platform has opened more than 80 cap@@ abil@@ ites .
some can be directly used , some are going through public or private beta testing , and others will be made available in the near future .
theses functions can be classified into three layers .
the first is the framework layer , which is P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle , an deep learning platform developed by Baidu .
P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle is now a open @-@ source platform .
it is the fundamental framework and the source of the development of all cap@@ abil@@ ites .
then there are scenario @-@ based machine learning cap@@ abil@@ ites .
P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle is the most comprehensive AI platform . it incorporates various cap@@ abil@@ ites , such as voice , O@@ CR , face and body recognition , image moderation , video , natural language understanding , knowledge mapping , AR , data management , etc .
I believe that P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle is the most comprehensive platform country@@ wide , even worldwide .
above P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle is our solution layer .
the solution layer is not only an integration of all cap@@ abil@@ ites , but also a program that has been thoroughly optimized based on every scenario .
it can be used by our developers and partners .
now I will briefly introduce the capabilities on each layer . first of all , P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
the goal of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle is to become the deep learning platform that meets best the need of developers in China .
first , it understands best Chinese . why ?
because it is deeply rooted in China and benefits from the profound experience that Baidu has acquired in processing Chinese for over a decade .
now P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle makes it available in the form of source code .
second , it satisfies best the needs of Chinese enterprises .
we know that data is the means of production of AI , and data security may be what most Chinese companies are concerned about .
our P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle offers stand@@ alone deployment and distributed deployment to help companies secure their data .
third , it suits Chinese developers best , because it was developed by Chinese developers , right ?
only what &apos;s unique to a nation can be precious to the world .
while constantly opening up various technologies and source code , we also developed deep learning curriculum according to the current technological context , so as to help our developers and engineers make more progress .
we know that AI is another major opportunity for developers in the way the past era of mobile devices rallied a large group of Andro@@ id and IOS engineers .
our own curriculum , along with those we developed together with Ji@@ ke Xu@@ yuan ( literally translate to &apos; Ge@@ ek Acad@@ amy &apos; ) , intends to help our developers and engineers become AI engineers .
then let &apos;s talk about facial recognition technology .
our facial recognition offers not only basic capabilities such as face and body recognition , face li@@ veness detection , face comparison , face search , etc . , but also solutions optimized based on region scenarios .
these solutions include AF@@ R @-@ enabled ID veri@@ fic@@ aton , AF@@ R @-@ enabled sign @-@ in , which you have seen when you came in , membership verification through face recognition that you saw in the pro@@ mo video , and the auto @-@ gate solution enabled by face recognition .
Wu Y@@ any@@ u , one of my co @-@ workers , will give you a more detailed introduction later of these solutions and basic capabilities , so I won &apos;t go into details here .
in short , we made face technology available with the goal to make every face recognizable .
next , our advanced text recognition .
it is fair to say that Baidu &apos;s text recognition may be the most advanced technology in the industry , way ahead of its competitors .
and text recognition consists of several cap@@ abil@@ ites .
first , the capability of general text recognition .
the second is card recognition , including ID cards , bank cards , driving licenses , vehicle licenses , etc .
third , web image recognition , which entails the recognition of W@@ ord@@ Art .
the fourth is the table and form recognition , which can adequately recognize and reproduce structured data in scanned copies .
it also be used in receipt recognition .
well , let &apos;s take an example .
first , common type@@ faces can be well recognized by line .
and W@@ ord@@ Art and distorted characters in web images , can also be properly recognized .
moreover , information on tickets and receipts can be identified by line with perfect accuracy .
in addition to these general capabilities , we will also open the customized O@@ CR templates in the near future , because we not only have to identify the characters correctly , but also reproduce the fields as you wish .
for example , here we have a medical bill .
the first one is a template customized by the user .
after the user defines the fields and values ​ that he or she wants to use , we upload a new medical bill .
the one in the middle was taken and uploaded by a mobile phone .
we use AI @-@ inf@@ used algorithms and image transformation to extract the subject we want to identify .
meanwhile , we identify the fields that the user wants to use , restructure and return them to a document .
in this way , we can meet specific needs of many developers and partners .
then there are all the capabilities of image recognition and image moderation , including subject detection .
it covers over a million tourist attractions , products and medicines .
common object identification can be used in almost a thousand scenarios .
it can categor@@ ize objects and detect subjects , etc .
as for the brand logo recognition , we cover more than 20,000 logo , and this logo library can be built by users themselves .
as for plant identification , we can identify more than 20,000 kinds of plants and more than 8,000 kinds of flowers ;
as for animal identification , we can identify thousands of animals ;
as for food identification , we can identify more than 50,000 kinds of foods and return their calories at the same time .
next we have vehicle model identification and vehicle damage identification .
we can detect more than 3,000 vehicle models and damaged parts .
as for image moderation , we have opened the capabilities to identify pornography , terrorism , politically sensitive contents , advertisements , sick photos and image quality assessment , etc .
this helps our moder@@ ators cens@@ or the content generated by UGC with greatly improved efficiency .
let &apos;s look at an example .
it is a video about vehicle damage assessment .
this is an application developed to assess vehicle damage .
it involves vehicle model identification and vehicle damage assessment .
by taking a picture of the whole vehicle and then full @-@ shot , mid @-@ shot and close @-@ shot pictures , we can assess the damage of the vehicle according to its model and damaged parts .
don &apos;t move !
we can see that the bumper , f@@ ender and head@@ light are damaged .
okay .
well , AI identified that the damaged parts are the bumper , f@@ ender and head@@ light , perfectly consistent with what had happened .
okay .
in addition to the common capabilities of image recognition mentioned above , we also have a customized training platform .
what are its advantages ?
you don &apos;t have to be an expert in image or image recognition to use it .
instead , it can automatically train itself and manage the models .
for example , this is one of our project and it is about Chinese herbal medicine .
you can feed it data of the medicine and it will then train itself .
taking this one for example , we can see that according to its estimation , the medicine is highly likely to be a sal@@ via , and it is I@@ need .
based on this platform , we have also worked with a partner and developed an application to identify th genu@@ in@@ eness of Chinese herbal medicine , such as Rho@@ di@@ ola ro@@ sea .
after proper training , the platform can verify the genu@@ in@@ eness of Chinese herbal medicine , which is impossible to an un@@ trained eye , with an accuracy rate higher than 95 % without human intervention .
next , let &apos;s talk about the reverse image search platform , including the search of similar and identical images .
this is very helpful in retail when users are searching for or sharing the picture of a commodity with one another .
specifically , as for searching for identical images , the platform can find the original or identical images whether or not they have been trimmed or scaled , as in the case of the first one .
second , even the image &apos;s resolution is low , the platform can also find images with higher resolution .
third , the platform can find the subject even if the background is different .
fourth , when the subject is too small , the platform can still find identical subjects , which is the search of identical images .
then as for the search of similar images , let &apos;s look at an example .
this is the search of identical images .
if you want to buy a product but don &apos;t know how to describe it or don &apos;t know its brand , you just need to take a photo .
this capability has been fully integrated into our Baidu Ap@@ p , you can just take a photo and start search , and it will show you similar or identical products , then you can make your real @-@ time purchase decision .
this is very helpful to the retail industry .
the next is a powerful intelligent video processing technology .
there are several aspects , and one of them is video content analysis .
what is video content ?
it includes people , text , sounds , and scenes at any particular time in the video .
we can use the technology to analyze these elements and then output them in a structured form .
another is the selection of video th@@ umb@@ nail .
as we know , for a video , the selection of th@@ umb@@ nail is crucial for its clicks .
we can increase the clicks of a video by selecting the best image according to our understanding of the video .
also , we can search for videos with reference , which means we can search for videos through image , and longer videos through a short video , or conduct data de@@ duplication in a video .
the popularization of live streaming has brought huge pressure on video content moderation because any violation might lead to the shutdown of a company .
now , with video content moderation we can screen out any forbidden content .
I &apos;ll give you two examples .
first , let &apos;s look at a case of video content analysis .
this is a clip of a film .
we can see that by using Baidu &apos;s video content analysis , we know what the scene is , whose faces appear at which time , what text in the scene appears at which time , what sound is made at which time .
so this is a very comprehensive system of video analysis .
by using this ability , we can convert all of our life experiences into structured data as long as we record them .
it means that it will be more and more difficult for wrong@@ do@@ ers to commit crimes in the future , and our world will become increasingly safer .
so if you want to do anything bad , hurry up when you still can . just kidding !
the next one is an example of video content moderation .
this is also a demo of video content moderation we made based on a film clip .
play it again , please .
when the content is normal , this box is green ;
when there is adult content in the video , this box turns yellow .
if there is pornography , sorry , it will be edited out !
OK .
we also have made voice technology available .
it mainly has three aspects : voice recognition , voice synthesis , and voice wake @-@ up .
voice recognition encompasses near @-@ field ones and far @-@ field ones , including whis@@ pers , long speech , etc .
and now this capability has greatly surpassed human &apos;s own ability to recognize voice .
my co @-@ worker Kang Yong@@ gu@@ o will give you a comprehensive introduction of voice technology later , so I &apos;ll give you just one example of voice recognition .
let &apos;s listen to a voice message , and tell me what it says .
you said &quot; Leg@@ end of White Sn@@ ake . &quot; what is it ?
does someone know it ?
let &apos;s listen to it again .
you said &quot; Leg@@ end of White Sn@@ ake . &quot; what is it ?
I &apos;ll give you a hint if you haven &apos;t got it .
it is a beautiful story about Hangzhou , and I read this story many times while I was a child .
let &apos;s listen to another one , &quot; 9@@ 6@@ 3@@ 68 cigarette order platform , &quot; can you hear it clearly ?
&quot; 9@@ 6@@ 3@@ 68 cigarette order platform , &quot; again . &quot; 9@@ 6@@ 3@@ 68 cigarette order platform . &quot;
so it is obvious that it is hard for us to figure out what the speaker is saying .
OK , let &apos;s look at an example of long speech recognition .
welcome to Baidu Cre@@ ate 20@@ 18 , I &apos;m very glad to give you a demonstration of Baidu &apos;s voice technology .
our voice technology ranges from voice recognition , voice wake @-@ up and voice synthesis to other technologies .
our ability to recognize long speech is also outstanding .
what I &apos;m saying now can be recognized in real time .
besides , whisper can be recognized , too .
I am in a meeting now , I will call you back later .
it can even recognize singing .
let &apos;s listen to a short piece of The Road to Ordin@@ ary .
I &apos;ve crossed mountains and oceans , and wandered through crowds .
everything I once had faded away in the blink of an eye .
I was once frustrated and disappointed , lost all direction , until I saw that the only answer lies in the road to ordinary .
it is a classic song .
then let &apos;s talk about basic technologies of language processing .
based on its sophisticated fundamental technologies , Baidu has opened the operators of technologies including basic lexical analysis , syn@@ tactic analysis , word vector , language model , semantic similarity between words , similarity between short text , comment and opinion extraction , and sentiment analysis and classification .
Baidu UN@@ IT is the most advanced platform in China for chat@@ bot training and development .
its capabilities consist of four aspects .
first , the understanding of needs , which means it can fully understand your intentions .
second , this platform provides dialogue management and flexible configuration .
it means that you can configure the dialog logic including what to say first .
third , it can quickly customize dialog units , including your domain of knowledge and Q &amp; A knowledge , all of which can be customized here .
the last one is a mechanism of sustainable optimization . through this platform , we can continuously optimize our models and products , so as to provide a better experience .
it can be applied in many fields .
for example , this is our developer , please play the video .
what ingredients would you like to use ?
we have selected the following recipes for you .
sole fish .
how long do you plan to cook this meal ?
we have selected the following recipes for you .
half an hour .
you would like to cook ...
because she did spend half an hour cooking , so that part is cut out from the video .
it &apos;s done .
the third step is to cut the sole fish into small pieces , and mar@@ inate them with two spo@@ ons of cooking wine , a little black pepper and salt for 20 minutes .
wait for 10 minutes .
we will remind you in ten minutes .
let &apos;s stop here .
such a complicated cooking process can be created with UN@@ IT , let alone the customer support in a retail scenario , right ?
it is also the fact .
the customer service robot we made by UN@@ IT for Du Xia@@ om@@ an &apos;s customer service center can solve more than 80 % of the problems , it greatly improved the efficiency of customer service .
next let &apos;s talk about the solution for Baidu robot , it is a combination of software and hardware .
it has several capabilities .
the first is visual iner@@ tial SL@@ AM .
second , relocation .
third , the design of open source hardware .
then there are depth map and the detection of obstacles as well as objects in scenes , etc .
let &apos;s watch an introduction video of this platform .
Baidu Open Rob@@ ot Vision Platform provides an integrated solution combining software and hardware .
the open @-@ source hardware module consists of a bin@@ ocular camera and an iner@@ tial sensor .
the robot SL@@ AM adopts a bin@@ ocular visual iner@@ tial algorithm , and the positioning result features short delays and small errors .
slam is optimized for robots and can cover a wide range of complex scenarios .
when receiving images , the bin@@ ocular camera obtains accurate and complete information of the obstacle through deep neural network .
the map @-@ building algorithm uses the positioning system of SL@@ AM to spl@@ ice obstacles and then obtain a two @-@ dimensional map , which helps the robot walk around independently .
the solution of robotic vision is connected to Baidu Cloud API .
with face recognition technology , it can quickly and accurately find the current user &apos;s information in a database of up to tens of thousands of people .
object recognition can identify various commodities and objects , while O@@ CR is used for text recognition .
Baidu &apos;s open robot vision open platform allows the machine to understand the world as human does .
imagine how efficient the distribution and delivery will be if such capability is integrated into our logistics robots .
okay , there are more AI @-@ inf@@ used capabilities and open platforms .
they include AR platform .
I won &apos;t go into details here .
later , my co @-@ worker Ma Xia@@ oxin will introduce the capabilities of AR .
in addition to these capabilities that we have opened , we also offer complete service and provide the best environment for development , learning and communication , including some development kits , as well as supports from the developer community , where developers can discuss their their works and exchange ideas .
if our developers have any questions , they can ask us or make requests through our official website portal or mobile portal . we may also talk about cooperation .
okay , we know very well that some of the capabilities we have opened and the work we have done are far from enough , so we launched Baidu AI E@@ cos@@ ystem Partner Program , hoping that our efforts could encourage our developers and partners to make greater achievements in implementing AI technologies .
this is our Li@@ ao@@ yuan Program .
let me explain .
what does Baidu E@@ cos@@ ystem Partner Program , namely Li@@ ao@@ yuan Program , mean ?
it means providing resources at multiple layers , such as in technology , customers , marketing , business operations and investment support to companies in the AI field , helping partners succeed in their business and sharing a AI @-@ them@@ ed future .
yes , if you become a Baidu AI ecosystem partner , you will be supported in terms of technology , clients and marketing resources .
meanwhile , we will choose some of our best partners to take part in our AI accelerator .
in the accelerator , you can take courses on business operation and receive investment .
so who can become our ecosystem partners ?
first , solution providers .
they integrate Baidu &apos;s AI technology with its own product and services to serve specific markets or mid @-@ end users , SI or IS@@ V .
second , the industrial chain manufacturers .
they are our hardware partners who have integrated Baidu &apos;s AI technology in their products , and the software or hardware manufacturers who help implement our AI technology .
then the ecosystem partners are divided into three levels of stars , namely one@@ - , two@@ - and three @-@ star .
the level is measured from dimensions such as registered capital and developers .
partners on different levels enjoy different rights and interests
mainly in three aspects .
first , technological resources .
our technological resources involve free access to AI services , a priority over product beta testing , regular training and learning , and invitation to events like our ecosystem partner program .
second , joint branding .
they are authorized to use Baidu &apos;s AI brand , the exclusive promotion channel of Baidu &apos;s AI , and joint B@@ T@@ L events of Baidu &apos;s AI .
third , customer sharing .
we are certainly far from achieving the ideal goal of our AI era with our own efforts , so we must share potential clients so as to implement AI together with our partners .
also , we can give them the priority to customize their needs .
in addition , their product services can be placed on our platform and we are responsible for the publicity and promotion .
moreover , we give our partners the priority of joining the accelerator that provides the following core resources .
first , courses customized by top instructors .
we have top @-@ level instructors in areas such as technology , products , entrepreneurship and investment .
there will be a three @-@ month intensive course and offline customized guide , and we have completed the curriculum design .
second , our ecosystem partner can enjoy the privil@@ edge of the three @-@ star level .
the third is Baidu Investment .
if you buy our shares and your program is highly in line with Baidu &apos;s business , you can obtain Baidu &apos;s cash and technology investment .
other high @-@ quality programs will win the attention of investment institutions such as Baidu Vent@@ ures .
third , technological support .
for the projects in the accelerator , Baidu can deploy the AI technological engineers and solution teams to work for the projects , so as to support their custom@@ ization and implementation .
our registration started last month , and it ends on November 17th .
you may want to consider scanning the code to register before the due date .
of course , please refer to the following website for details . if you have any questions , you can also contact us via email .
my co @-@ workers from Baidu investment division are here too , you can have a talk or consult with them after this presentation .
we hope to build the most open , well @-@ rounded and fai@@ rest technological ecosystem in 20@@ 18 .
in 20@@ 18 , we will work with 500 ecosystem partners , train 5,000 engineers specializing in deep learning , select 60 start @-@ ups into our acceler@@ ators , and invest in 10 AI start @-@ ups .
finally , I &apos;d like to say that the trend of AI is not a gust of wind but a tor@@ rent .
I hope that our open platform and Li@@ ao@@ yuan Program can really help our developers and partners improve their ideas and products , tackle technological hardship , and advance in their business !
OK , thank you !
in this lesson , we will discuss in detail how to write codes .
there are two issues that need to be addressed .
first of all , we need to establish a concept that codes are also a way of expression .
then , we will discuss the details about writing codes , including how to write a module , how to write a function , and how to write and name a code block .
now , I &apos;d like to discuss about the concept that codes are also a way of expression .
in a project , on which part do we spend most of our time ?
some of you may say that we spend much time in writing codes and documents .
well , according to a software engineering book , 50 % of our time is actually spent on communication in a project .
moreover , in the life cycle of software , we spend much more time in maintenance than in development .
how do we communicate in a project of software development ?
there are many ways , and some of them may have never come to our mind .
for example , we can talk face to face , or write E @-@ mails , documents and codes .
yes , codes are actually a way of communication .
so , I &apos;d like to emphasize that codes are mainly written for people .
in the early days of computer@@ ization , when we wrote programs in machine code , assembly language , or C language , we might think more about how to execute programs more efficiently with our codes .
nowadays , code compil@@ ers are remarkably efficient , thanks to the progress we &apos;ve made these years .
many of the code compil@@ ers have spared us the need of writing special codes .
so now when we write codes , we mainly focus on how to better get them through to other people .
this is why we should have coding standard .
then , what does coding standard usually involve ?
first , the programming methods , and the dos and don &apos;@@ ts when we use programming languages .
so what &apos;s our most ideal scenario ?
we can understand the codes written by others as if they have been written by ourselves .
when reading these codes , we think more about their logic instead of their formats .
in short , the most ideal scenario is &quot; don &apos;t make me think , &quot; as a book dec@@ ri@@ bes .
it means that we don &apos;t have to think too much when writing or reading codes .
next , I &apos;d like to talk about the problems we have often encountered in writing modules and functions .
let &apos;s take a look at this picture .
we can see that a module is a basic component of a program .
in a module there may be data , functions or classes .
then , a .@@ P@@ Y , .@@ C or .@@ Go file is a module in a Py@@ th@@ on , Go or C program , respec@@ tiv@@ ley .
when it comes to writing modules , we often put emphasis on cohesion rather than coupling .
in other words , it &apos;s important that each module has a specific function .
so we should deli@@ br@@ ate over how to split programs into modules throughout the process of compiling software .
well , I &apos;d like to present one of my frequently used methods of splitting programs into modules .
before splitting programs into modules , we should know which are data modules , and which are process modules .
a data module in data encapsul@@ ation or object @-@ oriented programming module mainly encapsul@@ ates data .
it is realized by the variables in a module or the internal variables in a class .
you can look at the right side .
I &apos;ll show you an example of Py@@ th@@ on classes .
here we have internal data , which is defined as the self.@@ table .
then , we have to provide other interfaces which can be called by this data module .
and the functions of these interfaces should be clearly defined .
in addition , the interface implementation and internal algorithms are both included in the module .
you can see the example on the right side .
in this demo , we have provided the Table module with two interface functions .
one is called &quot; set , &quot; and the other &quot; get . &quot;
that is , one interface is generally used for writing or setting , and the other is used for getting .
in the process of writing programs , we often have to define the data modules in the systems first .
this has something to with the data @-@ centric programming philosophy .
the reason why many programs are difficult to maintain is because the programmers fail to define the data modules .
that is , the data is not properly encapsul@@ ated .
a common example is to take data as a global variable and put it in all the components of each program .
the second category of module is process module , which does not contain data .
the process module can read a data entry from a file , or carry out related operation .
let me give you an example here .
this module can call other data modules and process modules .
I &apos;d like to reiterate the importance of this module .
just now , I talked about the importance of modules for software development .
properly splitting programs into modules is the cornerstone for the stabil@@ ty of software .
when building a house , we first build its structure , and then decorate the house .
if the structure is solid , we can easily change the decoration .
otherwise , it will cost a lot to demol@@ ish the house and build a new one .
software development is similar to building a house .
that is , if the programs are split properly , the potential re@@ factor@@ ing of the software will be within the scope of each module .
so there is no need to change the relationship of different modules .
if the software is poorly designed in the first place , it will be difficult to re@@ factor later because all modules need to be re@@ written .
moreover , we should try to reduce the coupling between modules as much as possible , as I have mentioned before .
if the relationship between modules is chaotic , such as using of a lot of global variables or the relationship between interfaces being unclear , the software will become expon@@ entially complex .
the clear relationship between modules , in fact , is conducive to the reuse of software in the future .
if the modules of the software are given specific functions , they can be easily se@@ per@@ ated and re@@ used in other systems in the future .
we have dis@@ c@@ used the modules .
now let &apos;s move to , classes and functions , which are two completely different models .
there used to be a mis@@ conception that function seemed out of date after object @-@ oriented programming emerged .
in fact , these two models have their respective scop@@ es of application .
as far as I &apos;m concerned , it may not be a good idea to describe the whole world with one uniform model .
I think that Java is a negative example .
it &apos;s a powerful object model .
you can write a simple process and implement it by using just one function in C .
however , you have to write a full class in Java .
so it actually makes a simple issue more complicated .
second , I &apos;ll share with you my experience in the experiment .
that is , if you have implemented a function irrelevant to the member variables in a class , it &apos;s recommended to extract it and use it as a separate function .
why ?
this will make it easier to reuse this function .
we have a function called Function , which is not related to the member variables in our class .
in this experiment , we have extracted this function from the class , and taken it as a separate function .
this is a simple example .
now , I &apos;d like to talk about object @-@ oriented programming .
first of all , I think that it is a good idea .
however , only a small number of people really understand and master it in China .
many people write non @-@ object @-@ oriented programs in a language with object @-@ oriented capabilities , such as C + + .
in fact , these programs are poor in data encapsul@@ ation .
what is the core of object @-@ oriented programming ?
it is data encapsul@@ ation .
therefore , when we start to write programs , rather than only focusing on the logic of code execution , we have to think about the associated data in the system and how to encapsul@@ ate it from a data @-@ centric perspective .
unfortunately , many people tend to think about the entire process of code execution when they get a project for system design .
there is another mis@@ conception .
it &apos;s that C + + language is object @-@ oriented , and C language is process @-@ oriented .
this is a common cognitive error .
well , C language is in fact object @-@ based .
that is , its major difference with C + + language is that it does not involve poly@@ morph@@ ism and inheritance .
the abuse of C + + language is quite often , because it has powerful functions and many variable components .
what is the most important task for a software engineer ?
it &apos;s to achieve the expected functions , rather than to be ver@@ bal@@ ists , to explore the different uses of C + + language , and to know the different results of execution .
moreover , I want to stress that the poly@@ morph@@ ism and inheritance in C + + language should be used carefully in our system .
if there are more than three layers of inheritance in a system , it &apos;s hard to know the complexity .
another paradox is that you can &apos;t properly design inheritance until you clearly understand a system .
however , we often start designing software without a clear understanding of the system .
the software might be a simple prototype in the beginning , and gradually takes shape .
given its object @-@ oriented nature and multiple inheritance layers , C + + language di@@ ms the possibility of a good initial design for the software .
therefore , we have to perfect the software through constant iterative development and refinement of the system .
now , let &apos;s talk about the components of the .@@ C file in a C program or the .@@ P@@ Y file in a Py@@ th@@ on program .
first , we have to write a file header to briefly describe the functions of the module .
secondly , we need to keep a proper record of revising the document , including the time of modifying the contents and the names of the programmers .
however , we often find that the names of the programmers are not shown in a lot of codes .
we also have to write other necessary instructions for the module .
in this module , we need to ensure that the contents are in a consistent sequence .
why ?
if the contents of the module are not in a consistent sequence , you have to search through the file for an item .
if the contents are in a consistent sequence , you can easily find what you want in the module .
here is an example of the file header in a Py@@ th@@ on program .
the first is the path of the Py@@ th@@ on interpreter .
I have written the basic overview of the module .
then I have written the history of writing the module , including the description of some key functions .
this is a simple example .
hello , everyone !
I &apos;m Wu Peng , a front @-@ end engineer from Baidu .
today , I will teach you the development of Mobile Inst@@ ant P@@ ages , also known as MI@@ P .
this lesson focuses on how to develop MI@@ P .
with this lesson , I hope that you can learn about the whole process of developing MI@@ P and eventually develop a simple MI@@ P .
today &apos;s lesson has four parts .
first , we will review the MI@@ P specifications .
then I will show you how to develop an MI@@ P , including its final validation and preview .
now , let &apos;s review the MI@@ P specifications .
MI@@ P specifications consist of two parts .
the MI@@ P @-@ HTML specifications and standard practices of MI@@ P Can@@ onical tags .
we have given you two Q@@ R codes .
you can scan them to see the details , or click the links here to see the contents in a PC browser .
on this page we can see that the MI@@ P @-@ HTML specifications involve many sections .
including head sector specifications , page elements specifications , HTML attributes , custom sty@@ ling specifications , and finally , the validation specifications , etc .
next , I will take this page of our official website as an example to show you the functions and purposes of these specifications .
OK .
the first part is the head sector specifications .
at the top of a MI@@ P , we can see the &lt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE &gt; tag .
what is this tag for ?
it is used to declare that the page is written in HTML 5 .
in the meantime , we will add a MI@@ P attribute to this tag .
this attribute is for identifying a page .
in other words , it tells the search engine that this is a MI@@ P .
similarly , we need to use the two tags , head and body , in a MI@@ P .
for the head tags , we recommend to use un@@ ic@@ ode UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding .
for the view@@ port , we recommend to set the minimum @-@ scale to 1 .
in this way , page style will not be altered as we zoom in and out on the page .
when developing a MI@@ P , we need to import the MI@@ P.@@ c@@ ss .
in here we may define general MI@@ P styles , as well as solve the compatibility problem between different browsers .
similarly , when writing a MI@@ P , we need to import an MI@@ P.@@ j@@ s file .
the mi@@ p.@@ j@@ s actually con@@ figures a basic environment on an MI@@ P .
we have defined many functions in it , including the whole operation cycle of the MI@@ P components .
and we have provided some common utility functions for web@@ masters .
these utility functions enable web@@ masters to easily use the functions for developing components .
next , I will talk about an important tag , link can@@ onical .
this tag makes one @-@ to @-@ one links between each MI@@ P and its original H@@ 5 page .
it aims to keep the weight of a search result page unchanged after we transform it to an MI@@ P .
when using this tag , we specify a URL in the h@@ re@@ f .
if the MI@@ P we are developing has a corresponding H@@ 5 page , we need to fill in the online address of the H@@ 5 page here .
if the MI@@ P is a transformation of the original page , and it does not have a corresponding H@@ 5 page , this h@@ re@@ f directs to the online address of the page being transformed .
next , I will introduce the MI@@ P elements specifications .
MI@@ PS allow two types of page elements .
the first type involves the officially released internal and external components , and the components customized by web@@ masters as they see fit .
we can use them on our MI@@ Ps .
the other type are some of the native HTML tags .
however , their use are subject to certain rules and restrictions .
on one hand , MI@@ Ps do not allow tags that may hinder pages from loading .
on the other hand , we do not use tags that may degrade the page performance .
OK now let &apos;s take a look at this table , which shows the tags allowed and dis@@ allowed in MI@@ P .
first , you can see these four tags .
image , video , audio and i@@ Fr@@ ame .
these tags , however , degrade the page performance .
therefore , they have been replaced with officially encapsul@@ ated components .
when developing MI@@ P , web@@ masters and developers must use these officially released components instead of the native HTML tags .
similarly , when defining the style in MI@@ P , there are also specifications to follow , which mainly involve two aspects .
firstly , the style tag can &apos;t be used for defining a style directly .
secondly , it is not recommended to link a c@@ ss .
the reason is that doing so will affect the page performance and the loading of pages .
so we officially specify to set a mi@@ p @-@ custom attribute to style .
in this way , we can write the styles of the whole page within the tag .
the style tag can be used only once in the head tag .
OK , next one is the script tag , which is also dis@@ allowed in a MI@@ P .
however , there are two special cases in which the script tag is allowed .
first , if it is used to link a j@@ s script of a MI@@ P component , it is allowed in the MI@@ P .
second , if the script tag is defined in j@@ son format , it is also allowed in the MI@@ P .
other types are dis@@ allowed .
in fact , MI@@ P also allows a series of tags , such as s@@ v@@ g , button , link and a tag .
the following elements , like the above ones , will degrade the MI@@ P performance during page loading .
therefore , they are also dis@@ allowed .
now , we move to the HTML attributes .
MI@@ P does not allow the attributes beginning with on , such as on@@ click and on@@ m@@ ouse@@ over .
the reason is that MI@@ P specifies an &quot; on &quot; attribute , in which we can write codes to bind and trigger all the events .
for details , you can refer to the official documents .
next , I will show you the specifications of using customized styles .
since this section has been covered before , we will take a quick look at it .
we mainly specify the style tag through a MI@@ P @-@ custom attribute and we can write styles of all pages in this tag .
other ways are not allowed , for example , the internal link shown here .
these are the specifications of validation .
it will be detailed in the later specifications for page development , so we will skip it here and elaborate it later .
that &apos;s all for HTML specifications of MI@@ P .
next , let &apos;s review and learn more about the specifications of MI@@ P Can@@ onical tags .
I have mentioned the specifications of Can@@ onical tags in the part of the MI@@ P @-@ HTML specifications .
but here I will show you the specifications of MI@@ P Can@@ onical tags in a more thorough and systematic way .
first of all , Baidu displays search results in two types of pages .
one is the MI@@ P , and the other is the original page .
the Baidu engine craw@@ ls these two groups of pages , and link them to each other through can@@ onical tags .
now that we have a can@@ onical tag , how do we use it ?
how do we link the original H@@ 5 page to the present MI@@ P ?
we have certain specifications for it .
in the original page , we will direct its address to the MI@@ P .
and in return , we will also direct the address of MI@@ P to the original HTML page .
let &apos;s look at this example .
in a non @-@ MI@@ P or an original H@@ 5 HTML page , we need to create an MI@@ P ht@@ ml attribute in the link tag of the head tag , and direct the h@@ re@@ f address of the non @-@ mi@@ p to the restructured MI@@ P .
we need to define a link can@@ onical tag in the MI@@ P , and direct its address to the address of the native website .
what if the MI@@ P is a result of restructuring of the original H@@ 5 HTML page and now I only have the MI@@ P ?
what can I do ?
how can I link the two pages with a can@@ onical tag ?
it is simple .
we only need to specify a link can@@ onical tag on the MI@@ P and direct the h@@ re@@ f address to the current MI@@ P .
then , in this way the MI@@ P and the H@@ 5 pages are linked .
after the restructuring of H@@ 5 page , it is recommended that the URL of the new MI@@ P comply with our specifications .
this part is quite simple .
we only require that after restructuring , the file name and ID are displayed on the new MI@@ P page as before .
for example , assume that the URL of an original page is m@@ .@@ ba@@ id@@ u@@ .com and its file name is 12@@ 3.@@ ht@@ ml .
let &apos;s look at the examples in the table below .
first we have a look at the four UR@@ L@@ s .
the domain name of the first URL changes into mi@@ p.@@ ba@@ id@@ u@@ .com , but the file name does not change .
the domain name of the second URL does not change , but an MI@@ P mark is added into the URL path .
the domain name of the third URL remains unchanged while the file name changes .
and yet , the previous name of the file remains the same .
both the domain name and the file name of the fourth URL change .
however , the previous name of the file remains the same , too .
all the four UR@@ L@@ s are allowed .
let &apos;s look at the last URL .
although the domain name stays the same , the file name is no longer the defined one , 12@@ 3.@@ ht@@ ml .
this kind of change is not allowed on the MI@@ P .
the file name and file ID must remain the same in the URL of the MI@@ P after restructuring .
these are the suggestion for the URL of the MI@@ P after restructuring , and the specifications on MI@@ P Can@@ onical tags .
now we know how to link an MI@@ P to the original H@@ 5 page and the specifications on restructuring .
when developing a MI@@ P , we should follow these specifications .
now that you have learned the specifications of the MI@@ P HTML and MI@@ P Can@@ onical tags , let &apos;s move on to the next part .
the next part is about page development .
in this part , I will develop an MI@@ P myself , so that you can learn and review the whole process of developing an MI@@ P .
I will talk about five parts .
tool installation , development directory construction , configuration file generation , and MI@@ P creating and editing .
I will develop a MI@@ P using the mi@@ p @-@ image component given by the MI@@ P &apos;s official website .
the goal is to display an image on the page .
OK .
now , the first step , namely , tool Install@@ tion .
this is simple .
we can install the tool globally by running the NP@@ M install @-@ g command .
firstly , install the tool on the terminal by running the NP@@ M install @-@ g mi@@ p @-@ cl@@ i command .
the installation takes a little while .
so let &apos;s go back to the P@@ PT and have a look at it .
the offline tool is a local command @-@ line development tool which supports core codes , MI@@ P components and MI@@ P development .
it provides an instruction set system that is easy to understand and use .
only one condition needs to be satisfied .
it must run in the No@@ de j@@ s environment .
after being installed with the method we have mentioned before , this tool is available globally .
it provides many functions , including file configuration , generation of MI@@ P components and pages , validation and preview of MI@@ P components and pages .
today , we are going to use three commands .
the first one is the mi@@ p in@@ it .
it initi@@ alizes the configuration page .
in this page , we can configure the core functions and component paths for local development .
the second one is mi@@ p add .
it generates an mi@@ p template that complies with the MI@@ P ht@@ ml standards .
we can edit and modify this template until the page is in line with our expectation .
the third one is mi@@ p server .
it generates a service based on mi@@ p con@@ fig and creates an address which can be pre@@ viewed locally so that we can preview the components and core functions locally .
OK .
let &apos;s see whether the tool is installed .
yes , it has been installed .
after the installation , how do we know that the tool is properly installed and ready to use ?
by running a simple test , a MI@@ P command , we can see if the tool is ready to use .
if such data , or information is shown , it means the tool has been installed globally and can be used .
moreover , we can run the &quot; mi@@ p hy@@ ph@@ en capital v &quot; command to find out the current version of the tool .
since the tool has been properly installed , we can move to the following steps .
namely , constructing the development directory , initi@@ alizing the configuration file , creating the MI@@ P , and editing the MI@@ P so that the final MI@@ P matches our expectation .
OK , I &apos;m not going to use P@@ PT to demonstrate this part .
instead , I will directly run some local commands .
first , access a working directory .
in this example , I develop the MI@@ P under the develop directory , and currently the folder is empty .
first of all , I create a folder for storing the HTML page .
let &apos;s name it HTML .
then I create an MI@@ P configuration file .
by running the mi@@ p in@@ it command , a MI@@ P con@@ fig file is generated .
and we can take a look at what kind of configuration items are in this file .
actually there are not many configuration items , and I will not explain them in detail .
today , we intend to develop an MI@@ P , therefore no configuration is needed in the file .
what relies on mi@@ p con@@ fig is the preview function of mi@@ p server .
after creating the configuration file and the page folder , we need to create a MI@@ P .
open the MI@@ P ht@@ ml folder and create a MI@@ P by running the mi@@ p add command with the page name being mi@@ p test@@ .@@ ht@@ ml .
then a MI@@ P is created .
let &apos;s open the MI@@ P with sublime .
we can see that the newly created page needs to be improved in many aspects .
here , take the heading for example .
I should change it to mi@@ p test demo .
the corresponding can@@ onical tag must be filled in with the original H@@ 5 HTML address or the MI@@ P address after the page goes online .
I fill in an online address , for example , mi@@ p test@@ .@@ ht@@ ml .
in this area , we can specify the list of styles of the whole page .
for now we do not need to generate the styles .
now first let &apos;s have a look at the page , to see whether the page has been generated .
I will show you how to do that by using &quot; Hello World &quot; as an example .
OK .
first we input &quot; Hello World . &quot;
sorry , my mistake , it &apos;s &quot; Hello , World . &quot;
and then we initiate a preview task locally by running the mi@@ p server command .
an address for preview is generated locally .
then , we open it in the browser .
on this page , we can see the directories of files edited locally .
now , we open the HTML folder .
and in the folder we can see the mi@@ p test@@ .@@ ht@@ ml page we edited .
open the page . we can see that on the HTML page &quot; hello world &quot; has taken effect .
next , I will demonstrate the simulation on the mobile terminal .
then , I will go to the official website and use the mi@@ p @-@ image component to generate the page we expect .
click the &quot; course &quot; tab on the official website .
and then click the mi@@ p @-@ image in the component list .
the dem@@ os here can be used directly .
so we copy them to this page and use them to replace the character string &quot; Hello World . &quot;
format the codes .
then we replace the picture in this component with a scenic photo .
then , we can see that the final demo is completed and it meets our expectations .
what we do next is to validate the page .
the validation involves two parts .
we can use the offline local command line of the development tools and the MI@@ P Val@@ id@@ ator to perform the validation .
alternatively , the official website provides a portal where a web val@@ id@@ ator is available .
directly paste the codes into this input box , and we could know whether the MI@@ P complies with the validation specifications .
here is the detailed procedure .
go to the Val@@ id@@ ator page of the official website , and paste the target codes into this input box .
we can find that the codes comply with the MI@@ P HTML specifications and the page is therefore validated .
I will also give an example in which the codes fail to be validated .
if an image tag which is not allowed in MI@@ P is inserted here .
some error messages will be displayed , showing the row , column , and detailed error information .
since the page we developed complies with the specifications , we do not change anything .
now , we move to the next part , namely , page preview .
we have pre@@ viewed pages during local development by using the mi@@ p server command .
we can use the other preview method . after the MI@@ P goes online , we enter the MI@@ P URL in the official portal .
then an online mi@@ p @-@ cache page is generated .
on the preview page , we can view the final presentation of the page , its style , etc .
OK .
that &apos;s all for my presentation today .
I have talked about the MI@@ P specifications , MI@@ P development procedures , and page validation and preview .
let &apos;s call it today .
to help you better understand this lesson and the whole MI@@ P developing process , here are your homework .
firstly , get familiar with installation of the MI@@ P tool .
secondly , get familiar with the basic commands required for developing MI@@ Ps .
thirdly , develop a MI@@ P containing the official MI@@ P components or the image components .
the evaluation criteria for your assignment is that your MI@@ Ps can be pre@@ viewed properly and validated successfully by the officially released val@@ id@@ ator .
this is the end of today &apos;s lesson .
for more information , you can visit the official MI@@ P website .
in next lesson , we will talk about the advanced MI@@ P development .
thank you .
hello , everyone !
my name is Ou@@ yang Jian . I am a principal architect of Baidu .
today , I will be introducing the architecture and application of Baidu &apos;s FP@@ GA @-@ based AI processor .
today &apos;s course consists of the following parts .
in the first part , I will explain what an FP@@ GA is .
in the second part , I will talk about the characteristics of AI computing .
in the third part , I will explain why FP@@ G@@ As are not just suitable but excellent for AI computing .
next , I will share with you how Baidu has used FP@@ G@@ As to develop its own AI accelerator in the past six years .
the final part is a summary .
let &apos;s begin by talking about what an FP@@ GA is .
FP@@ GA is short for field @-@ programmable gate array .
it is actually a chip which has a config@@ urable circuit structure .
you can think of it as a blank slate on which you can design specific circuit structures , implement your own add@@ ers , multi@@ pliers , logic gates , and so on via programming .
an FP@@ GA has rich resources inside .
you can look at the picture on the right .
different colors represent different resources .
pink represents look@@ up tables .
an FP@@ GA can contain more than one million look@@ up tables , which are used to implement general logic functions such as logic operations , or some additions and multipl@@ ications .
orange represents registers , which are used to hold data to increase the working frequency .
an FP@@ GA contains a lot of registers .
blue represents D@@ SP@@ s .
D@@ SP@@ s are very important .
they are a basic unit of complex mathematical calculations , including multiplication , addition , and accumulation .
they are critical for AI computing .
green represents block RA@@ Ms , that is , on @-@ chip S@@ RA@@ Ms .
they are used for on @-@ chip data buff@@ ering .
they are also very important for AI computing .
they are critical for data locality , high bandwidth , and low lat@@ ency .
therefore , we must make full use of the on @-@ chip S@@ RA@@ Ms .
I / O is very important for FP@@ G@@ As .
the I / O resource is used for external communications .
for example , we use PC@@ Ie I / O for communications with the CPU and DD@@ R I / O for communications with the DD@@ R memory .
for AI computing , an FP@@ GA cannot complete all calculations alone .
instead , it must work together with the CPU .
therefore , I / O is a very important bridge to inter@@ connect with external computing units .
for FP@@ G@@ As , there is another important part .
take a look at these red lines .
they are interconnection wires inside the FP@@ G@@ As .
these wires inter@@ connect all the resources I mentioned just now , enabling them to perform complex calculations .
FP@@ GA programming is different from CPU and G@@ PU programming , which we are more familiar with .
for micro@@ instruction @-@ driven archit@@ ectures like the CPU and G@@ PU , their programming language is C + + , C , or Py@@ th@@ on .
these languages are converted to assembly languages using compil@@ ers before execution on the CPU or G@@ PU .
an FP@@ GA is essentially a circuit and so a circuit description language is used for its programming .
we usually use Ver@@ il@@ o@@ g .
conversely , for CP@@ Us , C is often used to program its logic , which is then converted into instructions using compil@@ ers .
but for a circuit , we are actually designing its structure by using a set of algorithms .
at the same time , to develop FP@@ G@@ As well , we need the tools provided by the FP@@ GA manufacturer .
for example , to convert Ver@@ il@@ o@@ g into net@@ lists , we need the synthes@@ izer provided by the FP@@ GA manufacturer .
to convert net@@ lists into FP@@ GA binary files , we need tools for placement routing , wiring , and generating bin@@ aries .
these are all highly complex tools .
because FP@@ G@@ As are becoming bigger and bigger , more time is required for the whole development .
generally , for a large FP@@ GA , the time required for placement and routing is between ten to twenty hours .
in the picture in the lower left corner , we can see a small program for FP@@ G@@ As developed using Ver@@ il@@ o@@ g .
we can see that its structure is completely different from that of C and the logic is also completely different .
since it actually involves a circuit structure , it describes a specific operation in a parallel manner .
after synthesis , a gate net@@ list is obtained .
this net@@ list is ir@@ related to the FP@@ GA structure .
it is a gate structure .
after layout arrangement and wiring are completed by using the ED@@ A tool , it can be mapped to specific elements in the FP@@ GA , such as L@@ UT@@ s , registers , D@@ SP@@ s , and B@@ RA@@ Ms .
finally , these FP@@ GA tools are used to choose the wires for inter@@ connecting these logic resources to form a workable unit .
for FP@@ G@@ As , there are two important K@@ P@@ Is , namely resource consumption and working frequency .
suppose you want to implement a specific algorithm , such as this matrix multiplication .
your resource consumption will determine whether your design is good or bad .
at the same time , the working frequency is important .
if , for the same design , my working frequency is 500@@ m and yours is only 200@@ M , then my design &apos;s performance will be more than twice higher than yours .
therefore , these two K@@ P@@ Is are critical for FP@@ GA design .
what are the advantages of FP@@ G@@ As ?
just now , I mentioned that there are many logic cells in an FP@@ GA .
today , a large FP@@ GA , such as the 20@@ n@@ m K@@ U@@ 115 , the 16@@ n@@ m V@@ U@@ 9@@ P or the 14@@ n@@ m Str@@ ati@@ x 10 , has millions of registers , thousands of D@@ SP@@ s , and dozens of me@@ gaby@@ tes of on @-@ chip S@@ RAM .
with so many resources , it is highly suitable for parallel computing .
therefore , FP@@ G@@ As are used in large @-@ scale parallel computing scenarios such as AI .
it is also highly suitable for processing high @-@ speed data streams .
because an FP@@ GA has many internal resources , it is very suitable for stream processing , such as the internal pip@@ el@@ ining of data streams .
because an FP@@ GA is a specific circuit structure , the lat@@ ency of each row and level during data stream processing is highly exact , predictable , and stable .
therefore , we often use FP@@ G@@ As to process critical tasks .
in Baidu &apos;s dri@@ ver@@ less car project , the lat@@ ency must be exact and stay low .
in this case , FP@@ G@@ As are preferable to other processors .
the fourth advantage is their flexible I / O .
we can connect FP@@ G@@ As to CP@@ Us or many other sensors such as cameras , li@@ d@@ ars , and rad@@ ars to form complex single @-@ chip systems .
in addition , we can also customize our own processors to suit the application .
we can create a very flexible system by putting a few small CP@@ Us in an FP@@ GA .
while it has many advantages , it naturally also has its shortcomings .
the first shortcoming is that its development cycle is very long .
just now , I said that FP@@ GA development is different from CPU development .
for CP@@ Us , you only need to convert a high @-@ level language into instructions for execution .
since the circuit structure of a CPU is fixed , you only need to create instructions according to this circuit structure .
however , for FP@@ G@@ As , we need to perform two additional steps for the language to eventually be transmitted to the circuit structure , those being placement and routing .
because an FP@@ GA has a lot of logic cells , it will take a long time to find the optimal layout and routing .
therefore , the development cycle is very long .
moreover , debugging is very difficult .
for CPU debugging , we can find problems easily by using G@@ D@@ B .
but for FP@@ GA debugging , we must use the manufacturer &apos;s J@@ TA@@ G cable to look at internal signals or use simulation to solve problems in some cases .
if simulation cannot solve the problem , we must check the board .
this is very difficult .
in addition , there are time sequence challenges .
suppose that our design goal is 500@@ m .
however , as is usually the case , the first version is only 200@@ M or 3@@ 00@@ M , which is far from our goal .
we need to modify the design through iteration , optimize the time sequence , or take other actions .
this is very time @-@ consuming .
the second shortcoming is as follows : unlike CP@@ Us , CP@@ Us use micro@@ instructions , which can share the same circuit .
conversely , FP@@ G@@ As use fixed logic cells whose circuits are st@@ atically divided .
assume that we assign a logic block to function A .
this logic block then can be used only by function A , but not by function B .
it exclusively occupies that logical block .
therefore , the operator switch@@ over is not as flexible as that in CP@@ Us and G@@ PU@@ s .
next , I will talk about the characteristics of deep learning , from the perspective of computing .
as shown in this picture , there are three typical applications , or in other words , three typical computing scenarios for deep learning .
the first one is the training in data centers .
after we have collected a lot of training data , our algorithm engineers will design sophisticated models so that the data can be used to train out excellent models .
these are all done in the data centers .
after completing a model , we will distribute it to our online large @-@ scale servers .
for example , if we want to sort web pages , we will provide a specific model .
if we want to do advertising , we will introduce our technical models to advertisers .
the computing scale of the online system is usually larger than that for offline training because there are two demands on an online system .
first , it has to respond directly to user requests , for which low lat@@ ency and high service quality are very important .
besides , the user scale is usually very large .
Baidu search and other Baidu services receive a large number of user requests every day , and thus need the support of large @-@ scale clusters .
besides data centers , there is another online application scenario , that is , terminals .
AI will enable many , many terminals by granting them un@@ imaginable comprehension and perception capabilities .
the Baidu dri@@ ver@@ less car is a typical AI terminal .
in addition , our AI algorithms are used in such scenarios as face recognition turn@@ sti@@ le and Du@@ er@@ OS @-@ powered smart home devices .
the three basic application scenarios of AI are training in data centers , online services in data centers , and intelligent devices .
I just talked about three scenarios .
let &apos;s take a look at some of the core AI algorithms .
in the upper left corner , there is a typical D@@ N@@ N algorithm .
in the lower left corner , there is a typical CNN algorithm .
on the right , there are R@@ N@@ N and L@@ ST@@ M algorithms .
from these typical system and core algorithms , we can abstract the core operators , that is , matrix multiplication and conv@@ olution , which is usually used in CNN .
matrix multiplication , including vector @-@ vector multiplication , is commonly used in D@@ N@@ N , L@@ ST@@ M , and R@@ N@@ N .
aside from these major operators , there may be some typical operators such as activation functions , image @-@ related cropping , stit@@ ching , po@@ oling , etc .
if we want to design AI acceler@@ ators , we only need to accelerate these common operators to complete most of the computing tasks .
we &apos;ve talked about two points .
next , I will explain why FP@@ G@@ As can excell@@ ently accelerate AI computing .
let &apos;s take a look from another perspective .
first of all are the advantages of FP@@ GA .
first , its process technology uses the latest technology .
there are only two FP@@ GA manufacturers at present .
the first is Intel , which bought Alter@@ a two years ago , so it now has its own FP@@ GA product line .
the second is X@@ il@@ in@@ x , which is the inventor of FP@@ G@@ As .
it has almost forty years of history in the field of FP@@ G@@ As , and it leads the industry .
both of them are doing very well .
they provide the latest process technologies and use them in FP@@ GA products once possible .
Intel plans to release its 14@@ n@@ m Str@@ ati@@ x 10 FP@@ G@@ As in 20@@ 17 .
it will also release 20@@ n@@ m M@@ CP@@ s , which integrates 20@@ n@@ m A@@ 10 FP@@ G@@ As into general @-@ purpose processors .
X@@ il@@ in@@ x will release the 16@@ n@@ m V@@ U@@ 9@@ P this year .
it actually released the 16@@ n@@ m SO@@ C version last year .
in the next year , FP@@ G@@ As will undergo a great change , for both companies will launch FP@@ G@@ As with HB@@ M .
HB@@ M is short for High B@@ and@@ width Memory .
the memory bandwidth will be between several hundred gi@@ gaby@@ tes per second and one ter@@ ab@@ y@@ te per second .
this is a very large bandwidth .
it is basically an order of magnitude higher than the current server bandwidth .
HB@@ M is integrated into the FP@@ GA , which is beneficial to the FP@@ GA PC@@ B and power consumption .
this is a very good improvement .
by around 20@@ 19 , Intel will release 14@@ n@@ m MC@@ P products .
by 20@@ 19 or 2020 , the FP@@ GA process technology will evolve to 10@@ n@@ m and 7@@ n@@ m through iteration .
so you can see that FP@@ GA process technologies follow the latest technologies .
it guarantees that new process technologies can be used to solve problems for new applications .
the second advantage is its architecture .
just now , I mentioned that an FP@@ GA has a lot of logic resources such as D@@ SP@@ s , B@@ RA@@ Ms , and registers .
these resources are very suitable for AI computing .
in addition to these rich resources , the FP@@ GA micro @-@ architecture is also very innovative .
as we mentioned before , although our process technology is evolving continuously , the development speed is not as fast as it used to be .
during the early phase , a new version was iter@@ ated every 18 or 24 months according to Moore &apos;s law .
now , it takes two , two @-@ plus , three , or even four years to launch a new node .
in recent years , FP@@ GA manufacturers have found many new ways of creating innovative archit@@ ectures and micro @-@ archit@@ ectures to drive the continuous evolution of FP@@ G@@ As .
the second point is that there are new applications such as AI and data center services now .
driven by these new services , as well as by opportunities brought about by G@@ PU@@ s , a lot of innovations have been made for FP@@ G@@ As .
for example , Intel added HB@@ Ms to FP@@ G@@ As , and then integrated FP@@ G@@ As with CP@@ Us to form M@@ CP@@ s .
this will greatly broaden the application scenarios of FP@@ GA .
in addition , FP@@ G@@ As provide hard floating point and rich and flexible D@@ SP@@ s .
X@@ il@@ in@@ x will also provide HB@@ Ms .
in addition , they will provide massive ultra @-@ memories .
the capacity of an on @-@ chip ultra@@ RAM can reach tens of me@@ gaby@@ tes . this is essentially an S@@ RAM with huge data flows .
this is very useful for buff@@ ering AI parameters and input data and performing data locality .
it also provides rich and flexible D@@ SP@@ s .
there are some details of the architecture that cannot be disclosed because of the ND@@ As with the manufacturers .
with the release of new products , you will see more exciting features .
these new features will greatly consolidate the advantages of FP@@ G@@ As in AI computing .
in conclusion , in the FP@@ GA architecture , every subsystem is excellent .
for example , for its memory subsystem , we can use HB@@ Ms to ensure high bandwidth .
the bandwidth is an order of magnitude higher than the CPU bandwidth , and is even higher than the G@@ PU bandwidth .
moreover , we can have large @-@ capacity on @-@ chip S@@ RA@@ Ms , which is not possible with any other chip .
the G@@ PU has only a very small shared memory , specifically , a L@@ 2 cache of about two me@@ gaby@@ tes .
the L@@ 3 cache inside the CPU is about a dozen to thirty me@@ gaby@@ tes .
but its cache is not software controlled .
for a large FP@@ GA , the on @-@ chip S@@ RAM is thirty @-@ plus me@@ gaby@@ tes or even seventy or eighty me@@ gaby@@ tes , which is a lot .
moreover , this large @-@ capacity on @-@ chip S@@ RAM is software or circuit controllable .
therefore , it can be used very flexibly .
the second advantage is its computing subsystem .
an FP@@ GA provides several thousands to over ten thousand variable @-@ precision DSP blocks , which can be used to perform multiplication , addition , and accumulation with different prec@@ isions .
in addition , we can use these DSP blocks to implement other complex calculations , activation functions , and so on .
just now , I mentioned that FP@@ G@@ As feature a very flexible architecture .
therefore , the data path design is also very flexible .
it can be tightly coupled with the CPU , while we can also customize our own pipelines in the FP@@ GA .
let &apos;s take a look at the combined advantages of these three archit@@ ectures .
first , we can pursue the ultimate performance through deep custom@@ ization .
second , we can achieve a balance of performance , universality , and ease of use .
unlike G@@ PU@@ s , which are only suitable for some forms of data computing but not for irregular computing and data analysis , FP@@ G@@ As support diverse application scenarios .
I shall now talk about Baidu &apos;s practices over the past six years .
Baidu started to work on FP@@ GA @-@ based AI acceleration projects around 2011 or 2012 .
we might have been the first company to do so in the industry .
at first , we used the 28@@ n@@ m X@@ il@@ in@@ x FP@@ GA .
we eventually offered an FP@@ GA with approximately 30@@ W power consumption and 3@@ 80@@ G@@ ops to 1.@@ 3@@ T@@ ops performance .
at that time , this was the best performance efficiency in the industry .
after 2015 , we switched to the 20@@ n@@ m X@@ il@@ in@@ x FP@@ GA .
with this FP@@ GA , we also offered the best performance efficiency in the industry .
this year , 20@@ 17 , we switched to a new generation of FP@@ G@@ As of 14 or 16@@ n@@ m , which performance will be two to three times greater than that of the old generation .
at the same time , its energy efficiency will be much greater .
let &apos;s take a look at the architecture diagram .
it is the same diagram described in our paper presented at Hot Chi@@ ps in 20@@ 14 .
the left architecture is Baidu &apos;s S@@ DA , or Software @-@ De@@ fined Acc@@ eler@@ ator .
this was a concept we proposed .
this diagram clearly depicts the architecture of an AI accelerator .
in reality , the data of the D@@ MA on the left comes from the CPU .
in the FP@@ GA , we put the off @-@ chip DD@@ R@@ 3 or DD@@ R@@ 4 memory .
on the chip , the core part is the vector AL@@ U .
we complete the vector multiply @-@ accumulate calculation in the AL@@ U .
there is another small function , that is , activation function and some other calculations .
for the input and output of these computing units , we use a lot of on @-@ chip S@@ RA@@ Ms to buffer data .
the buffer ensures the re@@ usability of data , greatly improving the computing efficiency and reducing the computing power consumption .
we can compare this to the diagram on the right , which is a TP@@ U .
this is the diagram described in the paper presented by Google this year .
this diagram is similar to ours .
it is a clear deep learning architecture .
it also uses a syst@@ olic array architecture to implement vector multiply @-@ accumulate calculation and conv@@ olution calculation .
it uses activation function units to implement activation functions and uses a lot of on @-@ chip buff@@ ers to perform data locality .
hence , our proposed architecture in 20@@ 14 is similar to Google &apos;s proposed architecture in 20@@ 16 and 20@@ 17 .
at Hot Chi@@ ps 20@@ 14 , we released some of our data .
back then , we were using the 28@@ n@@ m FP@@ GA .
from the perspective of peak performance , the version we presented , which was our earliest version , offered only around 300 G@@ F@@ LO@@ Ps .
in the later versions , the value became higher , but we did not publicize them .
the 3@@ 80@@ G@@ flo@@ ps performance was not even half of that of the K@@ 10 G@@ PU , which could offer 1@@ T@@ flo@@ ps performance .
in our real system , however , because the online application performance is different from the benchmark performance , the batch size of input data is often very small for online applications , which is different from the benchmark .
as I mentioned before , online applications must respond to user requests quickly .
therefore , we cannot use large batch sizes , which will increase t lat@@ ency .
the batch size is usually 4 or 8 , or 16 at most .
it is rarely greater than 16 .
since the batch size is very small , our FP@@ GA solution will obviously be better than the G@@ PU solution .
we can see that the data throughput is about 3 to 4 times higher than that of the G@@ PU , which is excellent .
moreover , with only a power consumption of 30@@ W , we are able to obtain values which G@@ PU@@ s would need 200@@ W to obtain .
therefore , from the perspectives of performance , energy efficiency , and cost performance , FP@@ G@@ As have obvious advantages over G@@ PU@@ s .
in addition , we upgraded to the 20@@ n@@ m FP@@ GA last year .
using Res@@ Net , we performed acceleration of a deep learning CNN application model on this FP@@ GA .
at approximately 55@@ W power consumption , the throughput reached 1@@ 10@@ f@@ ps .
when we used the K@@ 40 G@@ PU with approximately 23@@ 5@@ W power consumption , the throughput was only 58@@ f@@ ps .
thus , the performance of the FP@@ GA is 1.9 times better than that of the G@@ PU .
energy efficiency is almost 8 times better .
as you can see , Baidu &apos;s AI accelerator can offer better computing performance and higher energy efficiency than general @-@ purpose circuit archit@@ ectures .
Baidu has done a lot of in @-@ depth research in the past six years , and we are the leader in terms of academic output among Chinese companies .
we presented three papers at Hot Chi@@ ps , one of the leading chip industry conferences , in 20@@ 14 , 20@@ 16 , and 20@@ 17 .
as Chinese companies presented seven or eight papers at Hot Chi@@ ps , our papers accounted for 30 @-@ 40 percent , or nearly half , of these papers .
this shows our strong technical influence in the field .
this also proves that we are not just blowing our own trumpet , but rather that our work is recognized by the leading bodies in the industry .
in terms of our work related to FP@@ GA in earlier years , in addition , one of our papers was accepted at AS@@ PL@@ OS 20@@ 14 .
this was the second AS@@ PL@@ OS paper from China and the first paper from the industrial circle to be accepted .
it was also the first Hot Chi@@ ps paper from the industrial circle .
before we presented the paper at Hot Chi@@ ps , it was rare for Chinese companies to present papers there .
our presenting of three successive papers had widespread influence internationally .
in reality , Baidu AI accelerator has been implemented excell@@ ently .
in my opinion , we have the largest application scale of the AI accelerator in the industry .
even compared to Google or Microsoft , we are not lagging behind in terms of application scale , popularity , and application depth .
in the past few years , FP@@ GA acceler@@ ators have been widely used in many of our internal services .
beginning from this year , we will provide FP@@ GA and AI accelerator capabilities via Baidu Cloud .
we will offer cloud @-@ based FP@@ GA service packages , FP@@ GA AI inference services , and even FP@@ GA training services .
we will also provide services for multimedia , biological information , AI acceleration , and more .
in addition , we will support private clouds .
I said just now that AI computing will not only be used on a large scale in data centers , but also on terminals .
therefore , we will provide services for terminal scenarios .
I shall now summarize why FP@@ G@@ As are suitable for AI computing .
first , it has a large number of computing units , including D@@ SP@@ s , L@@ UT@@ s , registers , S@@ RA@@ Ms , and high @-@ bandwidth DD@@ R@@ s .
in addition , it uses the latest process technology .
second , its architecture is very innovative and develop in high speed .
these advantages make FP@@ G@@ As ideal for AI computing .
Baidu noticed this technological trend five or six years ago and firmly seized related technological opportunities .
we have explored this field since then .
we provide the best computational performance and the largest FP@@ GA @-@ AI cluster in the industry . we have paid a high price and made great efforts .
our work has received the highest recognition in the industry : three papers at Hot Chi@@ ps .
that &apos;s all for today .

thank you !
hello , everyone !
in today &apos;s open course , I will talk about high @-@ performance AI hardware architecture .
my name is Ou@@ yang Jian .
this is my personal introduction .
I am a principal architect of Baidu .
at present , I focus on high @-@ performance computing for automated driving and heterogeneous computing systems for data centers and cloud services .
this is me .
my work experience is simple .
my first job was as an intern at Microsoft Research Asia , where I dealt with heterogeneous computing from the hardware perspective .
after graduating from school , I joined Baidu via on @-@ campus recruitment , and have been working here ever since .
besides work , I also do some academic research .
one of my papers was nominated for AS@@ PL@@ OS &apos; 14 Best P@@ apers .
this was the second AS@@ PL@@ OS paper from China .
I also presented papers at Hot Chi@@ ps 20@@ 14 and 20@@ 16 , as well as at E@@ UR@@ O@@ SY@@ S and other conferences .
I was also invited to deliver keynote speeches at such meetings as MP@@ SO@@ C and Ap@@ sy@@ s .
one of my patents has won the China Excell@@ ent Patent Award .
these works represent the industry &apos;s recognition of the direction of our high @-@ performance AI hardware architecture .
with regard to AI , we face systemic and holistic challenges .
speaking of AI , many people may think that AI is an algorithm or application .
in fact , AI brings systemic challenges .
first , it is a collection of machine learning algorithms , especially deep learning algorithms .
second , we need a huge amount of data .
we all know that a large amount of data are necessary for deep learning algorithms , or otherwise , results will not meet expectations .
third , we need large @-@ scale computing systems .
we all know that the emergence and popular applications of AI are inseparable from G@@ PU@@ s , FP@@ G@@ As , or some new computing technologies used in large @-@ scale data centers .
meanwhile , we also need large @-@ scale applications to provide more data to facilitate algorithm iteration .
that &apos;s why I say that the challenges we face are systemic .
today &apos;s open course is about AI hardware architecture .
three lessons will be offered .
in this lesson , I will give an overview .
for the next two lessons , I will talk about G@@ PU architecture and its application in the AI field .
then about the architecture and application of the AI processor developed by Baidu .
our self @-@ developed AI processor was made using FP@@ G@@ As , so I will focus on FP@@ G@@ As in the third lesson .
today , I will give an overview of high @-@ performance AI hardware architecture , which consists of three parts .
first , we will talk about why services need high @-@ performance AI hardware architecture .
as well about the background of this new technology .
in the second part .
I will introduce the background of the evolution of high @-@ performance AI hardware architecture at Baidu .
I will share many stories with you .
in the final part , I will talk about Baidu &apos;s outlook on this direction .
I just said that AI brings systemic challenges .
it involves many algorithms , including deep learning algorithms .
it possesses big data , and thus needs to be supported by large @-@ scale computing systems and a massive amount of applications .
we know that AI algorithms , especially deep learning algorithms , are very complicated .
very often , they involve matrix or conv@@ olution computing .
its complexity may be N to the third power .
in addition , it needs very large models .
the deep learning models we used a few years ago had seven to eight layers .
today , some models have hundreds or even thousands of layers , and might have several thousands to quadr@@ illi@@ ons of dimensions .
on the other hand , AI application scenarios are classified into online and offline .
for offline applications , we have a large amount of training data .
take Baidu &apos;s speech recognition as an example .
the training data may be a speech corpus containing tens of thousands of hours of speech data .
for our advertising system , the training data volume may be tens or hundreds of ter@@ ab@@ y@@ tes .
it may cover all advertisements in the past one year or half a year .
the data volume is very large .
for online applications , our application scale is very large .
for example , our voice service may receive tens or hundreds of millions of user requests every day .
with such large @-@ scale applications , not to forget our large models and high algorithm complexity .
we definitely need a large @-@ scale high @-@ performance computing system to provide support .
therefore , my conclusion is that for AI applications , no matter online or offline , large @-@ scale high @-@ performance computing systems are necessary .
this conclusion is widely recognized throughout the industry .
since we need such high @-@ performance large @-@ scale computing systems , why can &apos;t we buy products from the market or use existing solutions ?
why do we instead develop the AI hardware architecture ourselves ?
let &apos;s take a look at this picture .
this is a rough schem@@ atic .
the green curve represents Moore &apos;s law or the development of general @-@ purpose processors .
basically , in the first few decades of the past 50 years .
the development followed Moore &apos;s law was considerably rapid .
with performance doubling every two years or so .
but recent development has been relatively slow , and so we say that the post @-@ Moore era has arrived .
the performance of each new generation of CP@@ Us may be only 20 % -@@ 30 % higher than the previous generation .
therefore , the development is said to be gradual and slow .
however , we see a booming demand for AI computing in recent years , which is represented by the red line .
the increase is sharp .
the model is getting bigger and bigger , the amount of data is growing larger and larger , and the application is getting wider and wider .
the demand has increased sharply .
as such , there is a huge gap between the demand and the capability we can provide .
therefore , we cannot buy general @-@ purpose devices to make up the gap and satisfy the demand .
there are a few things that need mentioning here .
first , the Moore &apos;s law is slowing down .
it cannot satisfy the development of new AI services .
second , general @-@ purpose processors are based on the Moore &apos;s law .
they cannot meet AI computing requirements .
in such a historical context , we must customize the chip architecture for AI applications .
this is the earliest starting point of my series of lectures and the original intention of our work .
next , I will talk about Baidu &apos;s AI processor and the evolution of its high @-@ performance architecture .
many things happened .
I am pleased to share several stories with you .
Baidu can be considered one of the first groups in the industry that put efforts into this field .
basically , in the industry , we are ahead of others in using G@@ PU@@ s and developing AI chips using FP@@ G@@ As .
around 2012 , we used G@@ PU@@ s on a large scale to train Baidu &apos;s speech recognition system .
in 2012 , we launched many G@@ PU@@ s .
we were one of the first groups that used G@@ PU@@ s in AI .
in 20@@ 13 , we found that G@@ PU@@ s were not enough , especially for large @-@ scale online deployment .
therefore , we quickly developed our own FP@@ GA @-@ based AI chips and launched them on a large scale in 20@@ 13 to serve our speech recognition system .
at that time , the speech recognition used by the Baidu app and our input method was a background service which was created using Baidu &apos;s own AI chip .
then in 20@@ 14 , many AI applications , besides speech recognition , were actu@@ alized at Baidu .
in addition , our AI related system technology developed greatly .
for example , we used more G@@ PU clusters and also some 40@@ G and 100@@ g high @-@ performance networks .
the training scale was very large and so we needed to perform data interactions between multiple nodes .
therefore , we needed high @-@ performance networks to provide support .
at the same time , we also independently developed some AI systems .
such as P@@ addle P@@ addle , this kind of open @-@ source system is quite influential in the industry .
we started research and development of this system long ago , probably since 2012 .
we used this system on a large scale in 20@@ 14 .
in 2015 , our FP@@ GA project was an AI processor project .
internally , we called it the &quot; Fair@@ child project , &quot; and it won our company &apos;s highest award .
everyone knows that the name &quot; Fair@@ child &quot; holds special meaning .
Fair@@ child is regarded as the pioneer of semiconduc@@ tors , and it nur@@ tured many great companies .
when we started our project , we hoped to emulate Fair@@ child by becoming a pioneer of AI chips and later by nurturing many new technologies and applications .
today , our AI technologies are used in many scenarios , not only in data centers but also on terminals .
for example smart cars and face recognition turn@@ sti@@ les .
the application on terminals faces different challenges and problems from those in data centers .
it has higher requirements on power consumption , reliability , and cost .
therefore , our AI processors have also further evolved .
our AI ability has also been recognized by the government .
China &apos;s first national engineering laboratory .
first national engineering laboratory of deep learning .
and also first enterprise @-@ led engineering laboratory , was established in Baidu .
this represents the government &apos;s recognition for our efforts .
in conclusion , Baidu &apos;s high @-@ performance AI hardware architecture have been iter@@ ated for nearly 5 years , from 2012 to the present .
many applications and scenarios , from large @-@ scale data centers to terminals , are covered .
our work is well @-@ recognized in the industry , especially by some authoritative bodies in the industry .
for example , we presented a paper at AS@@ PL@@ OS .
this was the second AS@@ PL@@ OS paper from China and was nominated for Best P@@ apers .
we also presented two papers at another top conference , Hot Chi@@ ps , in 20@@ 14 and 20@@ 16 .
we are the company that presented China &apos;s fourth Hot Chi@@ ps paper .
therefore , our work is well @-@ recognized by the academic and industrial bodies in both China and abroad .
in the final slide , I want to show you the evolution and outlook of Baidu &apos;s high @-@ performance AI hardware .
to sum up , there are two points .
first , we have done a lot of work in the past five years .
but I still think that is not enough .
in the past , we did a lot of hardware optimization and fully exploited the hardware computing power .
however , we think that we still have a lot of work to do in the coming stages .
the previous work is not enough .
first of all , we want to create whole @-@ stack collaborative design .
we often hear about full @-@ stack or whole @-@ stack .
it is sometimes used to describe a person &apos;s engineering ability .
in this case , it refers to the whole technology stack .
in terms of AI , it covers AI applications , AI algorithms , and AI system software and hardware .
we plan to do whole @-@ stack collaborative optimization .
only with collaborative design and optimization can computing efficiency be optimized .
because our application scenarios are broad and diverse , including data centers and our computing terminals .
we seek to achieve optimal computing performance per wat@@ t and per dollar .
therefore , we have to optimize our software , algorithms , and hardware .
this goal can be achieved only through collaborative work and optimization across multiple levels .
second , although many of our works have become widely used internally and also serve many users via Baidu services , we believe we can further deepen our work .
therefore , we want to build a collaborative ecosystem .
we can put our efforts into two aspects .
for the first aspect , we can develop our large @-@ scale computing capabilities , including for G@@ PU@@ s and FP@@ G@@ As , via Baidu Cloud .
we can let developers develop the architecture of their own AI chips .
architectural requirements vary for different scenarios .
they can be used in Baidu Cloud before being used to serve other users .
for the second aspect , we have a national engineering laboratory which we jointly built with Tsinghua , Bei@@ hang , and other universities .
this engineering laboratory is a very open laboratory .
for we hope to share our capabilities with all AI stakeholders and innov@@ ators in China .
there will be more things that can be provided and shared from within this laboratory .
such as our many AI applications involving speech , image , Du@@ er@@ OS , and so on .
we also have algorithms , including image algorithms , speech algorithms , and control planning algorithms , which all have excellent performance .
we also have large @-@ scale software systems , such as P@@ addle P@@ addle .
and also our own FP@@ GA @-@ based hardware and so on .
we will comprehensively share all these things so as to benefit and accelerate the innovation of China &apos;s AI industry .
thank you !
hello , everyone !
thanks for watching the deep learning course of P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
my name is Li Zhao . I &apos;m an engineer from Baidu .
today , we will discuss deep learning and personalized recommendation .
in recent years , deep learning technology has perme@@ ated various fields like voice , image , and natural language processing .
at the same time , AI technologies represented by the deep learning is quietly entering the recommendation field .
person@@ alization is everywhere if people are involved , such as e @-@ commerce , film , news , and feed flow .
people would rather spend two hours watching a movie than spend 20 minutes choosing one , which can be solved by personalized recommendation .
in this course , we &apos;ll focus on three parts .
first , I will introduce the background of the recommendation system and the model design .
here we will introduce the task that we are going to finish and some important components , like text conv@@ olu@@ tional neural network .
furthermore , I will introduce a method that uses machine learning to perform ranking , which is called Learn to R@@ ank .
in the third part , I will guide you to build the model by using P@@ addle .
at the end , we will have a summary and an exercise .
in the background introduction part , we will answer three questions .
the first question , what is recommendation system ?
the second question , why do we need the recommendation system ?
finally , what is the difference between the recommendation system and search engine , which are two main methods for us to obtain information .
let &apos;s have a look at the first question .
what is recommendation system ?
in fact , almost all the mobile phone apps we use today offers personalized content .
many companies including Baidu have proposed a strategy like &quot; thousand pages for thousand people . &quot;
we can see that almost all the content on the new homepage of Baidu Mobile are personalized .
Baidu distribu@@ tes personalized recommendation to satisfy specific requirements of each person .
that is to say , different people have different homepage in Baidu apps .
for example , I like sports .
Baidu uses my user profile to build a model and analyze my historical behaviors , then it brings me the content that exactly matches my needs .
my homepage provides news about football and basketball .
the second example is related to music .
Dou@@ ban FM is a music app .
when you use this app for the first time , it will ask you to identify your favorite singers .
in fact , many apps or systems use this method in handle the user cold start .
also , users can give feedback on each song that Dou@@ ban recommends .
for example , they can delete a song , like the song , or pass it .
through the interaction with the recommendation system , the model will adjust its strategy and bring the most suitable and favorite songs for an individual user .
in the third example , let &apos;s look at YouTube , the world &apos;s largest video website .
almost all the content on its homepage is personalized .
its team has published many related papers .
at the top conference of the recommendation system last year , the YouTube team unveiled its recommendation system model based on deep learning and deep neural network .
let &apos;s look at its homepage .
this is my homepage .
it correctly identifies that I like to watch comedy shows in recent days .
the second question , why do we need the recommendation system ?
let &apos;s recall when was the last time you went to a bookstore ?
how long has it been since that happened ?
in fact , with the popularity of e @-@ books , readers , and mobile terminals , more and more people stop going to book@@ stores .
there is another reason .
there are too many books in a bookstore .
when you walk into a bookstore , it is hard to find a book you like .
this brings a problem .
a statistic in 2012 showed that 90 % of the data in the world was generated during the period from 2010 to 2012 .
this means information overload , so there are just too much information around the world .
some entrepreneurs even claim that we are going from the IT era to the D@@ T era .
what is the IT era ?
the IT era is about information technologies .
then what is the D@@ T era ?
the D@@ T era is a new age driven by the data .
in this era , the leading role is the data instead of the information .
the third question , what is the difference between search engine and recommendation system ?
the recommendation system is different from a search engine .
one of the most important differences lies in that the recommendation system is the one where information finds people , not people finds information .
for example , I recently bought a book on Amazon called T@@ enc@@ ent Bi@@ ography .
this book describes the growth of an internet company .
then , Amazon may recommend similar books to me , like Ali@@ baba Bi@@ ography or other books wrote by the same author .
the second difference is that the recommendation system is more suitable for users who do not have explicit requirements or whose requirements are hard to be described in words .
in our daily life , the recommendation system and search engine supplement each other in many business scenarios .
for example , when you search for Jay Ch@@ ou in Baidu , it will recommend a lot of Jay Ch@@ ou &apos;s songs , for example , Listen to Your Mother .
the second part focuses on our model design .
I will talk about the task we will soon accomplish , its function , and some important components .
in this course , we will build a model that is a neural network for film recommendation .
in this film recommendation task , the data set we use covers user information , film information , and user ratings for films .
the input to the task is user ID and film ID .
the model provides a score between 0 and 5 .
for a higher score , the model tells that the user demonstrates a stronger preference for the film .
for example , after training , if the user with ID 1 rates 4.@@ 25 for the film with ID 1962 , our model determines that the user like this film .
next , I will introduce an important component called text conv@@ olu@@ tional neural network .
that is , how the conv@@ olu@@ tional neural network is used in natural language processing .
in our previous course , we introduced the achievements the conv@@ olu@@ tional neural network has accomplished in image processing .
it also accomplished excellent achievements in natural language processing .
the process is as follows .
after embe@@ dding a piece of text input , there is a sliding window for word vector conc@@ at@@ en@@ ation .
then , the vectors are input into a conv@@ olu@@ tional layer , which is followed by po@@ oling . finally , the results are output .
let &apos;s investigate the process .
first , there is a sentence &quot; The cat sat on the red mat . &quot;
let &apos;s analyze this sentence .
the word vector of the ith word is xi .
we use k to denote the dimension of the word vector of each word .
if we use n to denote the length of the sentence , we now have a sentence matrix of the shape n multiply by k , as shown in this graph .
the second step is to emb@@ ed word vectors .
here we define a word window H .
assume that the word window size is 2 .
we can use this window to generate a sequence .
in this example , the sequence is the cat , cat sat , and so on .
in the case of exceeding the boundary , 0 can be used to fill .
in addition , we have a mathematical definition .
specifically , the symbol Xi : I + h @-@ 1 indicates the conc@@ at@@ en@@ ation of these vectors .
different word window sizes can be used .
then , data is input into the conv@@ olution layer .
conv@@ olution ker@@ n@@ els are used on each word window to obtain a feature map .
during the operation , we can use some nonlinear functions , such as sig@@ mo@@ id .
this graph shows the results of operations of four conv@@ olution ker@@ n@@ els .
that is , it contains four feature maps .
these are operations on the conv@@ olution layer .
the subsequent operations are on the po@@ oling layer .
in the po@@ oling layer , the largest element is taken from each feature map to form the final vector conc@@ at@@ en@@ ation of this sentence .
for example , there are four feature maps .
after the largest element in each feature map is taken , we get the final vector representation .
the last layer is the output layer .
if the task of the network is text classification , we can input it into the Sof@@ t@@ max for multi@@ class classification .
furthermore , we can add some tricks on this layer , such as drop@@ out .
the reason is that some papers show that if the task is text classification , adding some tricks on this layer may bring 2 % -4 % improvement in the model .
ranking is the core component for information retrieval , like online advertising and the recommendation system we discuss today .
in fact , the recommendation system is to rank all the commodities to simulate the user &apos;s preference for these products .
learn to R@@ ank is a method for building a ranking model by using machine learning technologies .
there are three basic methods .
poin@@ tw@@ ise , p@@ air@@ wise , and list@@ wise .
next , we will distinguish the three methods from the perspective of input .
in poin@@ tw@@ ise , the ranking modeling can be formulated as a classification or regression problem .
its input is generally the feature vector of a single commodity .
its output is the query and the relevance of each commodity .
as can be seen from the description , it has an obvious advantage , that is , simplicity .
however , it comes at a price .
it does not consider the relationship between the commodities , which should not be ignored .
therefore , poin@@ tw@@ ise also has its limitations .
the second approach is p@@ air@@ wise .
its input is commodity pair that have partial order relation .
its output is the preference of each pair of these commodities .
for example , if the input is commodities A and B and the model output shows that the rank of commodity A is higher than that of commodity B , we mark it as 1 .
otherwise , we mark it as -1 .
after obtaining the partial order of many pairs of commodities in this way , we can obtain the relative ranking of all commodities .
the third approach is list@@ wise .
its input is all commodities under a certain query .
its output is a ranked list or per@@ mutation .
we &apos;ve briefly introduced some approaches applied in Learn to R@@ ank .
you can read the paper wrote by Dr. Liu Ti@@ ey@@ an from Microsoft .
the title of this paper is shown beneath .
in the third part , we will complete the model by using P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle .
in this model , we firstly explain the data set used for this film recommendation task .
the data used in this model mainly includes 1 million ratings from 6@@ 000 users on 4@@ 000 films .
in the data set , user characteristics include user ID , gender , occupation , and age .
film characteristics include film ID , genre , and name .
for more details about the data set , refer to this link .
information fields of user data are separated by two col@@ ons .
the information fields include user ID , gender , age , occupation , and zip code .
the age field contains some mapping relationships .
for example , 1 indicates ages under 18 while 18 indicates ages between 18 and 20 , 24 .
similarly , there are also mapping relationships with respect to occupations .
here is an example .
the user data is 1 , and the user is a woman .
her age field is 1 .
that is , she is under 18 .
her occupation is the one indicated by 10 , which is followed by the zip code .
film information is represented in the similar way .
the fields include film ID , name , and genre .
the genre includes action , adventure , and animation .
here is an example .
this piece of data represents the film with ID 1 and contains the film &apos;s name and genre .
the genre features animation , children movie , and comedy .
the next field is the rating .
the rating data contains the user rating on a film and rating time .
in this example , the data shows that the user with ID 1 gives the film with ID 193 a score of 5 .
to simplify the training process of the whole model , P@@ add@@ le@@ P@@ addle encapsul@@ ates the data pre@@ processing process .
if you want to train your data , you can refer to our encapsul@@ ation process to complete data pre@@ processing .
our pre@@ processing process is described in the following link .
next , I will explain the architecture of the model .
this graph shows the overall architecture of the model .
let &apos;s look at the user first .
there are four features .
after performing embe@@ dding and full connection for each feature , we obtain the vector representation for the four features .
then , we combine the four features to obtain the final feature of the user .
similar processing is employed for films .
note that we use the text conv@@ olu@@ tional neural network to learn film name features .
after we obtain the user and film features , we input them to the cos@@ ine similarity calculation and use it to reg@@ ress the result to the user rating on the film .
next , let &apos;s see some specific model configurations .
here I will introduce some major configurations , for example loss function and some networks .
later , I will use a video to demonstrate the more detailed process .
first , P@@ addle supports rich types of data , like basic inte@@ gers , dense vectors that are often used in image processing .
and integer dense vector sequence .
you can consider integer sequence as an array .
moreover , the sparse binary vector is also supported , which consists of 0 and 1 .
take the film genre as an example .
if a film belongs to a certain genre , it can be marked as 1 .
otherwise , it is marked as 0 .
for all the data types supported by P@@ addle , see this link .
first , the user features are constructed .
for the user features , we take the age of the user as an example .
we &apos;re gonna start with the user &apos;s age .
since the user &apos;s age is an integer , this layer of the network is constructed first .
then , it is input to the embe@@ dding layer , which is followed by a full connection layer .
in this way , the final representation of the user age feature is obtained .
for other three features , similar processing is performed .
after obtaining the four features , we connect the four features and input them to the full connection layer .
using the hyper@@ bol@@ ic tang@@ ent as the activation function , we can obtain the final representation of the user &apos;s features .
for the film features , we take the film name as an example .
first , we obtain a dictionary of the film name .
we have encapsul@@ ated this step .
the main operation here is to perform word segmentation for all film names .
then , define an ID for each word in the vocabulary .
input ID@@ s of words in each film name to the integer sequence .
in this way , a network is constructed .
then , connect it to the embe@@ dding layer to generate a two @-@ dimensional vector matrix mentioned before in the text conv@@ olution .
next , input it to a text conv@@ olu@@ tional neural network .
this is film name .
we finally get its vector representation .
similar process is performed for other features .
in the same way , we finally obtain the vector representation of the whole features with respect to the film .
we use cos@@ ine similarity to calculate user features and film features .
also , we can set the loss function .
for example , here we require the use of M@@ SE cost .
it optim@@ izes our prediction result and labels the sum of the squares of the difference .
next , let &apos;s train and use the model .
first , based on the cost we created just now , we need to establish a parameter set .
then , we can create a trainer based on the parameters .
here , we can specify some optimization methods as well as set the learning rate .
during the training , we can draw images to observe the convergence process of this model .
after the model is trained , we &apos;ll give it a test .
here , we can input the user ID and film ID .
for example , the user with ID 2@@ 34 gives the film with ID 3@@ 45 a score of 4.@@ 16 .
next , I will show you how this model works . I &apos;ll run this model on the notebook .
first , download the Doc@@ ker image .
if you have downloaded it , you can check it .
for example , this is a container that I am running .
then , go to our notebook environment .
this is the contents of all our courses .
go to the section discussed today - recommendation system .
we skip the explanations and go directly to the code .
first , initi@@ alize P@@ addle .
then , you can see our encapsul@@ ated data , such as the features of a film .
you can also see user data .
here are some data mapping distributions .
we can see a piece of complete training data .
for example , this piece of data indicates that user 1 gives film 1@@ 193 a score of 5 .
in the model configuration , input the user features first .
after obtaining all user features , we combine and conc@@ at@@ en@@ ate them .
the activation function is here .
the final representation of user features is obtained .
film features are processed in the similar way
the film genre here uses the sparse binary vector data type .
after we obtain the user and film features , we use the cos@@ ine similarity to calculate the correlation between them and fit the result to the user rating .
also , we set the M@@ SE cost .
next , we train our model .
first , we define the parameters .
we can import and export the parameter set so that we can exchange the model between different computers .
then , we construct the trainer .
here we can specify some optimization methods .
now let &apos;s start training our model .
in event handler , we can perform some operations to output some promp@@ ts or some drawings to help us understand the operations during the convergence process of the model .
this picture shows the final training result .
well .
now we run the cell on the notebook .
well .
as you can see , the picture is changing , which means that our model is being trained .
after the model is trained , let &apos;s see how to use it .
in this code , we set the user ID as 2@@ 34 and film ID as 3@@ 45 .
our model considers that the user gives the film a score of 4.@@ 16 .
OK .
this is the whole operation process .
that &apos;s all for today &apos;s course .
in the next lecture , we will introduce a text classification task .
we will use an emotion analysis app to learn applications of the recurrent neural network and its vari@@ ants .
over the recent years , the recurrent neural network has accomplished outstanding achievements in natural language processing .
it provides the best results .
at the end , I will give an exercise to you .
in this course , we use the conv@@ olu@@ tional neural network for sequence processing , that is , text processing .
however , through the study of the previous courses , we know that the conv@@ olu@@ tional neural network has an excellent ability to learn image features .
how do we use it in film recommendation , and make it learn image features in the film recommendation task ?
for example , we can use the conv@@ olu@@ tional neural network to learn features of each film poster , which is a very important feature .
suppose I never watch cartoons , I will not click a film whose poster features a cartoon .
this feature is worth exploring .
I hope you can give a try after the class .
we provide the data set , which is the latest data set of Mo@@ vie@@ L@@ ens .
in the latest data set , one of the fields contains the film ID on the website called them@@ o@@ vi@@ ed@@ b .
through this film ID , we can use the API of the website to obtain the poster of the film .
well , that &apos;s all for today .

thank you !
hello , everyone !
I am Dai Ha@@ ish@@ eng , an engineer from Baidu .
today I &apos;m going to talk about the second part of the Baidu &apos;s voice technologies and their applications .
there are 4 parts in my presentation : automated speech recognition ( AS@@ R ) , voice wake @-@ up , text @-@ to @-@ speech and vo@@ ice@@ print verification .
the relevant voice technologies and applications of the last 3 parts will be the focus in this video .
let &apos;s begin with a brief review of the AS@@ R and its application .
as I have explained before , AS@@ R means you input a speech into the AS@@ R engine , and then the engine returns a recognition result .
AS@@ R pays more attention to what you have said .
there are 2 models built in the engine , namely acoustic model and language model .
the 2 models have both gone through some deep neural networks train@@ ings .
today I will discuss more about the other 3 parts .
the first part is voice wake @-@ up .
in which kinds of scenarios will the voice wake @-@ up technology be applied ?
let &apos;s review the scenarios in which AS@@ R is used .
AS@@ R will recognize the speech you input and convert it into a text .
here we meet a problem when talking to a robot at home .
will the robot be triggered by the conversation between you and your friends ?
the answer is Yes .
the robot will give some futile responses if it keeps monitoring or communicating .
how can we avoid this situation ?
one possible way is to manually operate the robot , letting it know the time when a response is required .
hence some problems may arise from the manual operation .
so what can we do to deal with this situation ?
we can also use voice wake @-@ up to trigger the robot .
what is a voice wake @-@ up ?
you can let the robot know you are calling it by saying &quot; Xia@@ od@@ u , Xia@@ od@@ u , &quot; then the robot will respond &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot;
it is like a conversation between you and your friend .
only by being called the name , will the friend in the crowd knows you are talking to him .
equipped with voice wake @-@ up , the robot is thus ready to monitor your voice .
on hearing the particular words the robot will be triggered to interact with you .
in this way , manual operation and unexpected response can be avoided .
this is the main scenario to apply the voice wake @-@ up .
let &apos;s move on to the workflow of voice wake @-@ up .
most work@@ flows resemble that of AS@@ R very much .
you input a speech flow , and the robot sends the identified key words to the engine when feature extraction is completed .
the wake words will be recognized and then scored to indicate how much they resemble each other .
furthermore , we will set a threshold value to compare with the score .
the wake word can wake the robot if the score out@@ numbers the threshold value , say 60 , otherwise the word will be abandoned .
by setting this threshold value we are capable of controlling the accuracy of wake word .
what are the main indicators of voice wake @-@ up ?
the first is false rejection rate , or FR@@ R .
what does it mean ?
it means the number of the identification failures when I say the wake word to the robot for 100 times .
the lower the FR@@ R , the better .
the other indicator is false acceptance rate , or FA@@ R .
what does FA@@ R represent ?
it means a word , other than the wake word , triggers a false alarm .
accordingly , the robot will generate an incorrect response .
therefore , FA@@ R shall also be lowered as much as possible .
while the algorithm and model are determined , the two rates can be adjusted based on threshold value .
power consumption shall be considered , if your device , without external power source , is on and computation is proceeding .
for example , if your cellphone is 0.5 to 1m away and you want to operate it via voice wake @-@ up , then you must think about how long will the cell phone battery lasts .
so we must lower the power consumption as much as possible .
a relatively higher power consumption may be allowed if external power source is available .
next , I &apos;m going to talk about the key factors that shall be taken into account during application design of voice wake @-@ up .
the first is wake word .
in terms of design , easy @-@ to @-@ remember is the first idea popping up in our minds .
other factors , say brand effect , shall also be considered .
we select Xia@@ od@@ u Xia@@ od@@ u as the wake word of Rob@@ ot Xia@@ od@@ u so as to promote Baidu .
the other principle is that the wake word shall be rarely used in our daily life .
if you pick the word &quot; Xiao@@ yu &quot; as the wake word , which is frequently heard in videos , audi@@ os or talks between friends , false wake @-@ up may easily occur .
the final concern is whether the selected word can easily wake up the robot in terms of the pronoun@@ ci@@ ation .
what can we do to test whether the selected word can easily wake up the robot ?
the syll@@ ables must conform to some rules , for instance they should have a certain length .
we recommend users upload some easy @-@ to @-@ remember and rarely used wake words to Baidu Voice Cloud .
a program there will automatically evaluate the feasibility of this word .
in addition to the design of wake words , the performance of voice wake @-@ up is also impacted by environment .
for example , if your device is 0.5 to 1 meter away , the device is in a car , or the voice box is 3 to 5 meters away .
normally , under various environments the voice will inevitably atten@@ uate along the transmission route .
we will put more efforts to front @-@ end technologies such as microphone array , microphone boost and signal enhancement , since they all have an influence over the quality of the final speech .
we still need to notice different environments , such as one full of TV noises or human voices , will also lower the acceptance rate of wake word .
that &apos;s why we have to take the environment into account .
device is another key factor .
as I have mentioned , we have to filter out noises within different distance , we need to enhance the signal amplitude .
so we might develop microphone array at front @-@ end to mod@@ ulate signal ampl@@ it@@ udes .
as a matter of fact , while in@@ hibiting the noise , the enhanced signal is also experiencing some changes itself .
so we wonder whether special treatment for different signals is required in the model or algorithm .
power consumption shall also be considered .
for example , power consumption must be in acceptable level if you are trying to use your car @-@ mounted phone via voice wake @-@ up .
to achieve this , we must minimize the model size and simplify the algorithm to make things simple , for these impact the final performance of the voice wake @-@ up .
briefly speaking , voice wake @-@ up is a recognition @-@ based technology that enables you to control your device via voice only , making voice interaction a reality .
our focus varies according to the applications .
for some applications , we focus more on the wake @-@ up rate ; for others , we are more concerned by impacts caused by false wake @-@ ups .
for instance , unexpected wake @-@ up should be avoided at night so we monitor it by setting an appropriate threshold value .
besides , wake words should be selected according to specific demands of various applications .
consequently , they should be easy to remember , conducive to brand promotion and hard to trigger by mistake .
the next part is the application scenario of vo@@ ice@@ print verification .
I created a perfect scenario previously in which AS@@ R could be triggered and controlled via voice wake @-@ up .
but , if we add a TV into that perfect scenario , will a false wake @-@ up be triggered by the voice or wake words from TV ?
for example , will the robot be triggered by the wake word &quot; Xia@@ od@@ u , Xia@@ od@@ u &quot; from someone else in distance ?
what can we do to deal with this situation ?
vo@@ ice@@ print verification is a solution .
what is vo@@ ice@@ print verification ?
vo@@ ice@@ print verification focuses more on the one who is talking .
the robot will only be triggered if vo@@ ice@@ print verification has verified that you are the one who is actually talking .
as you can see from the video , the workflow of vo@@ ice@@ print verification resembles that of voice wake @-@ up very much .
similarly to voice wake @-@ up , vo@@ ice@@ print verification need to score the vo@@ ice@@ print and a vo@@ ice@@ print model library .
the vo@@ ice@@ print model library shall be trained independently with other training principles .
yes .
the model library must be trained by your voice so as to ensure the robot will be triggered only by yourself .
there are also three indicators for the vo@@ ice@@ print verification , including FR@@ R .
it indicates the number of verification failures when I repeat for 100 times .
the second one is FA@@ R .
it means the number of false acceptance when I repeat for 100 times .
power consumption may be a problem to devices without external power source .
let &apos;s look at the application design and factors that should be considered during design of vo@@ ice@@ print verification .
firstly , a text @-@ related mode may be applied for vo@@ ice@@ print verification .
what does a text @-@ related mode mean ?
it means fixed phrases can be used as the speech and words for verification .
what benefit can it generate if we reuse the wake word &quot; Xia@@ od@@ u , Xia@@ od@@ u &quot; ?
the users will no longer be required to memorize another word that has passed vo@@ ice@@ print verification .
the robot will complete verification and give response when it is w@@ aken up by you .
one benefit is that the text @-@ related mode enables us to complete verification based on a very short speech .
there is also non @-@ text mode .
with this mode the robot can perform vo@@ ice@@ print verification based on any types of texts you use during training or recognition .
limited by the current technology , we must collect a long speech for verification and recognition , for your text is unrelated and uncertain .
in some cases , voice training should last 8 seconds or longer , and the voice for test should last over 3 seconds .
what methods can be used to collect the users &apos; voice for training and recognition while the users are totally unaware of ?
as an example , when a customer is calling the bank customer service , the voice of the customer is then available .
we will confirm some information , which constitute a speech , with the customer when he / she is calling for the first time .
after verification , the speech could be used for training .
then , when the customer is calling again for some information , the vo@@ ice@@ print verification will automatically verify whether the voice really comes from the customer , helping the service staff to evaluate risks .
a serious predicament of vo@@ ice@@ print is voice imitation .
can someone else manage to trigger the robot by im@@ itating your voice ?
or , people may record your voice and play it to pass the verification .
text @-@ to @-@ speech may also be used for imitation .
what can we do to prevent imitation ?
there are actually some useful options we can resort to .
one option is robustness , with which we can identify and block the im@@ itated and synthesized voice .
this option will be discussed later .
dynamic text is another option .
it resembles the dynamic code you receive when you make mobile payments .
this dynamic code varies each time .
we will verify your identity by sending a dynamic code and checking whether what you say com@@ forms to that code .
thus , dynamic code is hardly to be recorded in advance or im@@ itated .
robustness is related to many other factors .
one factor is environment .
the former vo@@ ice@@ print verification performed well in a quiet environment .
but a poor performance was also detected in a noisy environment .
device is another factor .
the device used to record voice for training is more suitable for recognition .
otherwise , the disparity of signal channels between the recording device and recognition device may degrade the vo@@ ice@@ print verification .
the robustness may also be impacted by ourselves , as the voice might vary with time and our health conditions .
we might get ho@@ arse when being ill .
there are no efficient solutions available right now .
base on some deep learning solutions , we might have a chance to optimize the robustness of vo@@ ice@@ print verification , if the voice is short enough .
to conclude , for vo@@ ice@@ print recognition and verification , we should explore preferable designs for training based on existing voice or automatic recognition , in an attempt to not bother the customers .
special care shall be paid to the robustness of vo@@ ice@@ print itself .
robustness can be observed in various devices , environments , persons or the varied voice of the same person at different times .
we have also made endeavors to prevent recording and imitation .
similarly , false alarm rate and success rate shall be considered during vo@@ ice@@ print verification .
certainly , the focus may change with distinctive application .
for example , if we create an account that can only be visited via vo@@ ice@@ print , we might be able to keep the false alarm rate at a very low level while the success rate is kept at acceptable level .
I have briefed on the AS@@ R , voice wake @-@ up and vo@@ ice@@ print verification .
those are three technologies all using speeches as the input , while having different recognition target .
for AS@@ R , the output is the content of our speech ; the voice wake @-@ up judges whether the output is a word ; the vo@@ ice@@ print verification determines who you are .
sometimes after your speech is recognized and processed , the information is not enough so the robot may ask you for more details .
for example , when you say &quot; Xia@@ od@@ u , Xia@@ od@@ u , please book a plane ticket for me , &quot; the robot might asks you for more information , such as the destination , the date and ticket types , etc .
how does it ask you ?
the robot is programmed to generate a text it will ask via conversation management , later the text will be sent to a speech synthesis module and then be output as a piece of speech .
that is exactly the technology of speech synthesis that we are going to talk about .
let &apos;s check the workflow of text @-@ to @-@ speech .
we have learned that text @-@ to @-@ speech is divided into two types that are conc@@ at@@ en@@ ative synthesis and rules @-@ based synthesis .
what do the two types stand for ?
in both types , the numerous recorded voice will go through some preliminary treatments , such as text analysis , rhythmic pause and acoustic parameter estimation .
when preliminary treatments end , the conc@@ at@@ en@@ ative synthesis will pick out several segments from those speeches and conc@@ at@@ en@@ ate them again , if those segments are applicable .
as for the rules @-@ based synthesis , all the parameters are obtained through speech training .
once the acoustic parameters are met , speech will be synthesized via a vo@@ co@@ der , rather than by conc@@ at@@ en@@ ation .
here is a speech model training , or synthesis model training , based on deep learning .
the input here stands for the text to be synthesized .
under the guidance of recorded voice , the text will be sent to the neutral network for parameter optimization , so as to better match the output voice and existing voice .
to evaluate the performance of speech synthesis , we would often refer to the output speech , which expresses actually subjective feelings .
there are two ways to measure the performance for the time being .
the first one is MO@@ S , which is given by people who have heard the output speech .
assume that the highest score is five , which indicates that the quality of the output voice equals to that of an extraordinary broadc@@ aster , then zero is the lowest .
commonly , 4 is really high .
current AS@@ R has obtained a very high score in terms of artic@@ ulation and flu@@ ency , reaching 4 or 5 .
the other is AB@@ X expressed as 0 / 1 . what does it mean ?
if there are two text @-@ to @-@ speech engines ,
which one is better ?
the better one scores 1 , and 0 for the other .
then we could evaluate the final perf@@ om@@ ance generally .
in general , scoring the performance is a subjective process so the scores can hardly be quanti@@ fied objectively .
what factors shall be considered in the application design of text @-@ to @-@ speech ?
I have introduced previously the two options for text @-@ to @-@ speech , one is conc@@ at@@ en@@ ation synthesis based on speech library and the other is forman@@ t synthesis based on parameters .
the rules @-@ based synthesis may suit you better if your device is embedded , you have no access to internet , or you are troubled by data stream .
the text @-@ to @-@ speech can be adjusted to be so small that can be equipped in the device .
the rules @-@ based synthesis can output speeches of better flu@@ ency .
however , since they are not generated by human voice but are purely artificial , these speeches could lack clarity .
the other type enables you to complete cloud @-@ based synthesis .
used as an enormous speech library , the cloud will transmit a conc@@ at@@ en@@ ated voice back to you .
despite of a poor performance in flu@@ ency at the conc@@ at@@ en@@ ation sites , this method uses real human speeches .
reasonably , you are able to employ the most suitable option based on the respective application scenario .
the other factor related to the text @-@ to @-@ speech is person@@ alization .
existing robots are not allowed to change their tone . how intriguing it would be if the robot could help tell stories to kids by im@@ itating the tones of the father or mother .
when you receive a message , it may be more fascinating if the robot could read loud the message in a tone similar to that of the sender .
what can we do to make it a reality ?
self @-@ adaptive technology is a necessity .
once receiving the voice of your mother , we will set out the self @-@ adaptive mode to imitate it .
so that the speech synthesized sounds more like your mother &apos;s .
current text @-@ to @-@ speech entails speeches with minimum noises .
most speeches in this technology are reco@@ red in recording studios .
under the existing algorithm , the text @-@ to @-@ speech may not guarantee a good per@@ form@@ acne all the time if the speech is recorded at home .
what should we do to deal with that ?
this is something to be considered during application design .
the first step is the selection of basic models , we can build different models .
we can create multiple basic models appropriate to female and male from different areas .
if the voice sounds like the mother &apos;s , a corresponding basic model may be selected for self adaptation , so as to optimize text @-@ to @-@ speech .
the other solution lies in how to efficiently collect voice data for training .
for example , when someone is tex@@ ting you , you may have already kept his or her speeches in voice ch@@ ats or voice calls .
so will those speech data be collected for training ?
we should also try to simplify the work of our users .
what does it mean ?
users may not cooperate well with us if they are asked to record a long speech at the beginning .
but if we select a basic model first to show them the performance of our technology , users will be much more willing to cooperate with us by recording their speeches .
sometimes you are also able to record the voice from a mother who is telling stories to children for training purposes .
better cooperation may be obtained if the user is not intentionally recording for you .
in conclusion , there are 3 aspects about text @-@ to @-@ speech being elaborated in this video .
the first aspect is to select a suitable synthesis method from the customer @-@ based forman@@ t synthesis and server @-@ based conc@@ at@@ en@@ ative synthesis .
emphasis on personalized scenarios is the second aspect . for instance , speeches can been obtained from scenarios where parents are telling their kids stories .
speeches collected from your phone calls or text messages can also be used .
we will also endeavor to simplify the cooperation of users via application design .
while reviewing the AS@@ R , we have also gone through 3 new technologies : voice wake @-@ up , vo@@ ice@@ print verification and text @-@ to @-@ speech .
we discussed a lot about application scenarios , work@@ flows and some special tips of those technologies .
for more details , you can contact us through the following ways .
hello everyone !
I am Wei Li@@ kai , an audio engineer from Baidu Voice Technology Department .
today I will give you some details on the applications of voice technology .
as of now , our three technologies including automated voice recognition , Text @-@ to @-@ Speech and voice wake @-@ up have already been opened to users .
among which , voice wake @-@ up is a purely off @-@ line technology .
automated voice recognition and Text @-@ to @-@ Speech are both accessible online and offline .
and they are available on and@@ ro@@ id and IOS , as well as the SD@@ K@@ s of these two platforms .
in addition , the two platforms also provide RE@@ ST API .
because this lesson only lasts for about 15 minutes , I therefore directly use the simplest RE@@ ST API to show automated voice recognition and Text @-@ to @-@ Speech , followed by a simple operation to demonstrate the capability of SD@@ K .
all codes involved can be downloaded from G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b , and the download link can be found in the appendix of this lesson .
OK , let us start with the simplest operation .
let me show you the function of Text @-@ to @-@ Speech which is based on RE@@ ST API .
in order to use the function of Text @-@ to @-@ Speech , we need to complete two steps .
in the first step , we need to acquire a token which can be used to achieve Text @-@ to @-@ Speech synthesis through the synthesis interface .
now , let us give a try .
search &quot; Baidu Speech &quot; via Baidu search engine and enter its official website , yu@@ y@@ in@@ .@@ ba@@ id@@ u@@ .com .
find the &quot; Document Center &quot; where we can find &quot; Text @-@ to @-@ Speech RE@@ ST API . &quot;
then , find &quot; Auth@@ entic@@ ation mechanism &quot; and click it .
this page contains an example link which can be used to acquire the token .
now , let &apos;s copy this example link into the address bar of the browser .
in this link , two parameters need to be replaced , namely client _ id and client _ secret .
their corresponding keys can be found in Application Management .
click &quot; View key &quot; in Application Management .
the API Key can be used to replace client _ id and Secret Key to client _ secret .
copy these two keys to replace the corresponding parameters in the original link .
then the token we need can be acquired by clicking En@@ ter to open this page .
next , we need to use the synthesis interface .
it can also be used by copying the example link to the address bar of the browser .
then fill in the to@@ k and test fields with the tok@@ ens of the previous step .
the CU@@ ID field , which means the unique ID of a device , can be filled in with &quot; test . &quot;
the &quot; tex &quot; means the text to be synthesized .
we put a text into the field : &quot; example of Baidu Speech Syn@@ thesis . &quot;
now that we have built the link we need , we can produce the voice we need to synthesize by clicking En@@ ter to get : &quot; example of Baidu Speech Syn@@ thesis . &quot;
of course , the tex field can be replaced by any text you need .
for example , you can enter &quot; Baidu Speech offers technical supports &quot; and click En@@ ter to get the voice : &quot; Baidu Speech offers technical supports . &quot;
this is the Text @-@ to @-@ Speech .
then I will introduce automated speech recognition to all of you .
as opposed to Text @-@ to @-@ Speech , Autom@@ ated speech recognition is designed to convert speech into text .
the easiest way to use the automated speech recognition of Baidu is to use it through RE@@ ST API interface .
click the &quot; Document Center &quot; and find the RE@@ ST API of automated speech recognition .
and authentication mechanism is also required .
after acquiring the token , we can send our requests through the RE@@ ST API interface of automated speech recognition .
because it is very complicated to use RE@@ ST AP and RE@@ ST API of automated speech recognition , we cannot use them through a G@@ ET request .
therefore , we need to use a sample .
search G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b through Baidu Search Engine and search &quot; Baidu Speech Sam@@ ple &quot; on G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b .
find &quot; ba@@ id@@ u speech sample &quot; and click it .
in this sample , there is a category : rest ap@@ i / as@@ r .
after entering the category , you can find demonstrations in three languages and audio files of a sample .
in this case , we wish to use P@@ HP to perform the demonstration .
therefore , we now need to download a P@@ HP through a g@@ it clone request .
well , we already have a P@@ HP that has already been downloaded .
enter the RE@@ ST API catalogue and then as@@ r .
as you can see , there is a sample audio file in PC@@ M format : test@@ .@@ p@@ pm PC@@ M .
because this computer is configured to operate in P@@ HP environment , we can directly perform the demonstration using a P@@ HP script .
then , we need to download the P@@ HP script of this sample which has three parameters that need to be replaced .
the CU@@ ID field , which means the unique ID of a device , should be filled in with &quot; test . &quot;
two keys that can also be found in the corresponding application of Baidu Voice Open Platform are needed .
first , we should fill in these fields with the API Key and then Secret Key .
then , we save the configuration and execute it through P@@ HP script .
our audio file is not in the current directory , so we edit the script again .
as our sample audio file is in its parent directory , we can save the configuration and execute it again .
if your networking works well , you can get the recognition results of these audio files : Baidu Speech offers technical supports .
for other languages , you can refer to the sample .
there are some samples of j@@ ava and C + + .
similarly , if you use py@@ th@@ on or other languages , you can write a script based on the interface of ht@@ p independently .
we have displayed the recognition interface of RE@@ ST API which can only handle real @-@ time audio files .
if you want to achieve the recognition of audio stream , you need to leverage SD@@ K .
we also have a sample for Andro@@ id which can be used to demonstrate automated speech recognition and voice wake @-@ up .
import this sample into the development tool and then run it .
afterward , let us look at the phone .
click &quot; Reg@@ ular mode , &quot; &quot; Start &quot; and then &quot; Record Speech . &quot;
&quot; how &apos;s the weather tomorrow ? &quot;
&quot; what &apos;s the weather like the day after tomorrow . &quot;
different from the recognition interface of RE@@ ST API , we can see the result as we speak .
this is something that RE@@ ST API cannot do .
as a result , for products running on Andro@@ id and IOS , SD@@ K must be used .
as the final part of the video , I will share with you a voice technology product .
in this case , automated speech recognition , voice wake @-@ up and Text @-@ to @-@ Speech will all be involved .
now let us see what the product can do .
&quot; search for tomorrow &apos;s weather through Baidu Search Engine &quot;
&quot; navigate to the New Baidu E@@ di@@ fice &quot;
&quot; search for a badminton racket on Ta@@ obao &quot;
&quot; open W@@ ech@@ at &quot;
&quot; download Baidu W@@ aim@@ ai &quot;
&quot; call China Unicom &quot;
now , let &apos;s analyze the functions of this software and the way they are achieved .
this software supports the function of monitoring and making telephone calls .
apart from this , there is also Nu@@ om@@ i , of whom the pre@@ fix serves as a wake word .
once hearing these words , this software will initiate a recognition task which matches these pre@@ fix words with the targeting content in the search engine .
then we can get a recognition result of a text which will be analyzed to call a specific application .
if it is an instruction to make a phone call , it will be handled by the calling module to initiate the function of making a phone call .
and if you want to search for something , it will open the Baidu Search Engine through the browser .
of course , if you want to download or use other functions of Nu@@ om@@ i , their corresponding applications will be initiated as long as they are covered in the program .
given the limited time of this lesson , I will not demonstrate the specific codes here .
however , I will upload the complete codes of this product to G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b , and the specific link can be found in the attachment of this lesson .
that is all for today &apos;s lesson , we discussed the relevant technologies of Text @-@ to @-@ Speech and automated speech recognition , and we demonstrated a sample .
if you want to know more details of Baidu voice technologies , please contact us via our email or web site .
thank you !
we &apos;ve introduced the application of Baidu Trans@@ late and how to use Baidu API . you may be curious about the technologies behind machine translation .
now let &apos;s take a closer look at the technologies behind Baidu Trans@@ late .
speaking of machine translation , let &apos;s go back to the year of 1946 when the world &apos;s first computer was born .
only after the computer has been created could we realize machine translation .
at that time , a talented scientist conceived the idea that we could translate via computer .
in 1947 , an American scientist published a memorandum on translation and raised the question whether we can use computers for translation .
machine translation in fact is an inter@@ discipline that involves computer knowledge , information theory , cognitive science and linguistics .
over the past seventy years since 1947 , many machine translation methods have been proposed .
for example , at the beginning there was rule @-@ based machine translation . for rule @-@ based machine translation , we have lingu@@ ists summarize linguistic phenomena , write linguistic rules and compile them into computer @-@ readable forms , enabling computers to translate .
obviously if we do multi@@ ling@@ ual translation in this way , we need lingu@@ ists of different languages . the cost of development is explicitly high . so it becomes less used .
in the 1980s , example @-@ based machine translation came into being .
example @-@ based machine translation is based on an idea that when we learn a language , we may not care too much about its grammar .
instead we aqu@@ ire language intuition , or idi@@ omatic expressions , or syntax through extensive reading , and naturally build a translation model .
for example , we have a Chinese sentence meaning &quot; please give me a cup of water &quot; and we have its English translation .
so if we need to translate another sentence &quot; Please give me a pen , &quot; we can simply replace &quot; a cup of water &quot; with &quot; a pen &quot; , and get a syn@@ tac@@ tically similar target sentence . it is the primary idea of example @-@ based machine translation .
in the 1990s , some scientists from IBM came up with the idea of statistical machine translation . it is the mainstream method of machine translation so far .
for t@@ atis@@ tical machine translation , we build the translation model using massive bilingual data , from which we abstract the mathematical model of the relationship between the source language and the target language .
combined with the Internet , statistical machine translation became very powerful .
the research of statistical machine translation prevailed until 20@@ 14 .
the method of neural machine translation was proposed in 20@@ 14 . so far it is a research hotspot and has made great improvement in translation quality compared with statistical machine translation .
I need to point out here that in the time of rule @-@ based machine translation , that is , in the middle and late 1970s , commercial rule @-@ based translation software
online statistical translation systems emerged around 2006 .
they are two types of machine translation software at different times .
neural machine translation , as mentioned earlier , was just a lab trial back in 20@@ 14 and was far from industrial application .
take statistical machine translation for example . it was proposed around 1991 , but was not applied in online translation systems until 2006 , which is 15 years later .
how long did it take for neural machine translation to go from lab to industry , after it was proposed in 20@@ 14 .
it was in less than a year that Baidu launched the world &apos;s first neural machine translation system .
companies such as Google launched their neural machine translation systems later in September 20@@ 16 .
as mentioned earlier , there is a great deal of data available online after the internet emerged .
it &apos;s big data , like most people like to refer it as . for example , we can mine translation data from hundreds of billions of web@@ pages , and tens of min@@ l@@ lions of terms from authoritative dictionaries .
in the meantime , cat@@ ch@@ phrases and bu@@ zz@@ words spring up online , which need to be updated timely .
bilingual texts , authoritative dictionaries and cat@@ ch@@ phrases and bu@@ zz@@ words constitute our major training data for translation .
on this basis , we take measures like den@@ o@@ ising , detecting new words to process the data and get a high quality translation corpus .
there are various demands for online translation services , for example , there are demands for translating poems , essays , news and patents , as well as in @-@ chat translating .
it &apos;s plainly impossible to meet all the demands with a single translation system or model . therefore , Baidu Trans@@ late integrates multiple strategies to its translation system .
for instance , we have rule @-@ based machine translation , example @-@ based machine translation , statistical machine translation and the currently prevailing neural machine translation .
these translation methods draw on each other &apos;s merits and give full play to superiority so as to address different translation needs and generate high quality translation in the end .
now let me briefly introduce the respective advantages of these translation methods .
firstly statistical machine translation . as we mentioned before , statistical machine translation is based on massive bilingual data training .
let &apos;s see the two text@@ boxes on the top . the left text@@ box shows some bilingual data . the first sentence is in Chinese . the second one is in English . here we use Chinese to English translation as example to introduce statistical machine translation . we can see they are in one @-@ to @-@ one alignment .
on the right are English @-@ only data , which we refer to as mon@@ ol@@ ingual data . the data on the left are referred to as bilingual parallel data .
through statistical analysis , we can build a translation model using the data on the left . for instance , we can align the words in blue and those in red .
for example , &quot; w@@ o y@@ ao ga@@ os@@ u &quot; is a fragment in Chinese , and its english con@@ ter@@ part is &quot; I will tell . &quot; &quot; Ni &quot; can be translated as &quot; you . &quot; the alignment can be done automatically .
that is to say , on the basis of the bilingual texts , we can establish the relationship between the source language and the target language . so translation model is working more like a bridge .
then on the right we have a language model . the language model measures the flu@@ ency of target language .
for example , we can have a sentence like &quot; I am a student &quot; which is a pe@@ f@@ ect English utter@@ ance .
however , &quot; I is a student &quot; is un@@ grammatical .
the language model can tell that &quot; I am a student &quot; is more fluent than &quot; I is a student &quot; and give the former a higher score .
with the translation model , which plays the role of bridge , and the language model , which measures the flu@@ ency of the target language , we are able to translate .
for example , here I have a new sentence &quot; w@@ o y@@ ao ga@@ os@@ u ni y@@ ige G@@ ush@@ i . &quot; it is never seen in our training data . but we have seen these fragments .
for example , &quot; w@@ o y@@ ao ga@@ os@@ u &quot; can be translated as &quot; I will tell , &quot; &quot; ni &quot; as &quot; you , &quot; &quot; y@@ ige &quot; as &quot; a , &quot; and &quot; G@@ ush@@ i &quot; as &quot; story . &quot; then we put them together and get an English sentence &quot; I will tell you a story &quot;
but actually , we have more complicated strategies than this .
for instance , in conventional Chinese , sentences have different word order from English ones . so we need a process of re@@ ordering .
in addition , statistical machine translation , as we mentioned , is built on the basis of massive training data , we have massive training data in Chinese and English .
but bilingual data in less popular language pairs , such as Chinese and Thai , Chinese and Japanese , Chinese and Korean , are not so much in number , or even scarce .
in this case what can we do ? can we still use the method of statistical machine translation ?
the answer is yes .
we proposed the pi@@ v@@ ot language approach for machine translation . generally speaking , a pi@@ v@@ ot language is the third language introduced as an intermediary .
for example , we have a great deal of Chinese to English and English to Thai bilingual data . we can build a Chinese to English translation model and a English to Thai translation model se@@ per@@ ately .
we can use English as the intermediary and build a translation model for Chinese and Thai through deduction . and so we can build a translation system for Chinese and Thai .
thanks to this technology , We can quickly increase the number of lu@@ angu@@ ages Baidu Trans@@ late supports , from 2 , Chinese and English , to 28 or even more languages .
next I will brief you the rule @-@ based method .
what is its strength ?
it &apos;s that we can easily summarize rules and apply them to translation systems .
let &apos;s see two examples .
in the first sentence , the part in blue is a date &quot; September 28th , 2015 . &quot;
in Chinese , we usually express a date in the order of year , month , day , while in western style the order is month , day , year . so we can have a re@@ ordering in the English translation to make it idi@@ omatic .
the following example is a case of translating a number , say three hundred and eighty . we can easily write some rules about how to correctly translate three hundred and eighty .
this is an advantage of rule @-@ based method .
next is a demonstration of example @-@ based machine translation . it is good at translating new words , pro@@ verbs , bu@@ zz@@ words and idioms .
usually they can not be translated word by word . free translation is needed .
for example , here is a catch phrase &quot; No z@@ uo no die . &quot; how do we translate it ?
it &apos;s really difficult .
a proper translation was worked out and included in an American urban dictionary .
it &apos;s really difficult , no matter what translation method is used .
so we put it in our training data .
when we encounter the same sentence , we directly fetch the translation in the data and present it to users .
this is an application scenario of example @-@ based machine translation .
finally let &apos;s look at neural machine translation that rises in recent two years .
in statistic machine translation , which we mentioned earlier , we actually segment source texts into different fragments such as &quot; I will tell , &quot; &quot; you . &quot;
as I mentioned , when we put the fragments together in the process of translation , we may need to re@@ arrange their order , and we may encounter problems like the absence of context .
neural machine translation is free from such problems . it en@@ codes the entire source texts at first and outputs the translation after numerous iter@@ ations and abstr@@ actions .
it &apos;s similar to human translation . we usually won &apos;t start translating a sentence until we read it through and get its general idea .
in this way , we are able to make the most of the context and the global information of the sentence . the translation generated is rather complete and in a proper word order .
this is an advantage of neural machine translation .
like I said before , neural machine translation was proposed in 20@@ 14 by a laboratory .
in less than a year , we launched the world &apos;s first online neural machine translation system on May 20 , 2015 . neural machine Tran@@ lation is known as N@@ MT for short , where N stands for neural . the release of the system ushered in a new chapter of N@@ MT &apos;s large @-@ scale application .
as we all know , in September 20@@ 16 , Google also lau@@ ched its N@@ MT system .
since then , neural machine translation has become a focus in both research and application .
but actually there are often difficulties to scale up a technology from laboratory to industrial application .
take statistical machine translation for example . when it was proposed in 1991 , the data , machines , models and engineering realization at that time constr@@ ain@@ ted its application .
it took 15 years before the first online statistical machine translation system came to the world in 2006 .
after the neural machine translation was proposed , we carried out in @-@ depth research on the aspects of efficiency , data and models , and quickly put it into application after improving it in many ways .
here I list some of the innovative and effective methods that we proposed .
these methods are published on top international conferences in the field , such as AC@@ L and Tri@@ ple AI .
if you are interested , you can check them out .
now I will take one of them for example .
this is a N@@ MT system we proposed in 2015 , which is based on multi@@ task learning . what problem does it try to solve ? it the translation of less popular languages that we mentioned before .
for example , we have massive Chinese to English data , but fewer Chinese to Thai , Chinese to Japanese , and Chinese to Korean data .
how can we solve this problem ?
we share the same en@@ co@@ der with Chinese as the source language .
as for target languages , each language has its own deco@@ der . therefore we realize the one @-@ to @-@ many translation .
we can simultan@@ iously translate Chinese into English , Korean , Thai , Japanese and other languages .
the work is re@@ view@@ d by New York Times as a path@@ breaking paper . it is a milestone and is widely quoted and used .
likewise , we rolled out translation service on mobil@@ es in 2015 .
for example , when you go travelling , you may suffer from no internet connection or high connection fee . if you download our offline package , you can enjoy high quality translation service from our N@@ MT@@ system .
considering mobil@@ es &apos; limited storage resources and computing resources , we need do more to ensure the translation model works on mobil@@ es .
for example , we compressed the model to a size 70 times smaller so that it runs smoothly with 30@@ MB of RAM on mobil@@ es .
we also use some dynamic loading algorithms and we also prun@@ ed the voc@@ abul@@ aries .
with such optimization , we can easily use our N@@ MT system on our mobil@@ es , which now supports various languages including Chinese , English , Japanese , Korean and so on .
Baidu Trans@@ late has gained wide recognition from experts and scholars . for example , it was awarded the first prize of Science and Technology Progress Award by The Chinese Institute of Electronics in 20@@ 14 . in the next year , 2015 , it won the second prize of State Science and Technology Progress Award .
here in the list are the papers we have published . if you are interested , you can search and download them online .
thank you .
hello everyone !
today I will give an introduction on Baidu Trans@@ late .
let &apos;s start with the application of machine translation .
this is a picture of Ros@@ etta Stone which is very familiar to us .
it is inscribed with three versions of a decree issued when King P@@ tol@@ emy V. in ancient Egypt was crowned . the top one is in Ancient Egyptian hier@@ og@@ l@@ yp@@ hic , the middle is in D@@ emo@@ tic while the bottom is in Greek used in Ancient Egypt .
the three scripts record the same thing .
but over time ancient Egyptian hier@@ og@@ l@@ yp@@ hic and dem@@ otic have been forgotten .
when this stone was discovered , nobody really knew what its inscri@@ ptions mean .
but fortunately , the Greek used in ancient Egypt is inter@@ con@@ ected with modern Greek . so an idea occurred to some people that the ancient Egyptian hier@@ og@@ l@@ yp@@ hic script probably can be dec@@ ip@@ hered with modern Greek . and it was proved working .
thus people got to know the things recorded on the stone and the Egyptian hier@@ og@@ l@@ yp@@ hic script was successfully dec@@ ip@@ hered .
this method actually made use of machine translation . we can use machine translation to dec@@ ip@@ her languages .
so machine translation is somewhat fantastic .
well , here &apos;s the question : what is machine translation ?
in simple terms , machine translation is the process of translating from one natural language to another using a computer .
natural languages are languages used by human and are unique to human .
after thousands years of evolution , we have truly mastered this convenient tool of communication .
let &apos;s look at this passage .
it is written in Arabic . you may feel baff@@ led or even helpless looking at it .
what does it say ?
if it were in English or Japanese , I might be able to guess the meaning of it .
but it is in Arabic ! how can we manage to know what it intends to express ?
with machine translation , we can know its meaning after getting its Chinese translation . this is the magic of machine translation .
machine translation holds so much significance in multi @-@ language information retrieval , cross @-@ language communication , and international trade .
for example , we can use machine translation to get countries &apos; economic information , news and intelligence in real time , especially intelligence that may be milit@@ arily important .
in fact , it is for military purposes that many countries have funded the research on machine translation .
in the United States there is a world @-@ class machine translation evaluation every year . it focuses on lan@@ ug@@ ages which are politically sensitive or important to the United States , such as Arabic and Chinese .
ordinary people can utilize this technology to achieve cross @-@ language communication .
for instance , thanks to machine translation , we can communicate with foreigners face to face when traveling abroad , or chat with them on line .
in addition , now many people shop on overseas websites . with the help of machine translation , we can translate the product information , prices , and addresses , and communicate with foreign customer service staff .
so machine translation has become more of a part of our daily lives .
for example , we can use machine translation to help us memor@@ izing new words , reading and writing in English or other languages .
as for reading , as I have mentioned earlier , we can take advantage of machine translation to obtain financial information , news , military and political information of other countries .
aside from this , we can communicate smoothly with foreign friends face to face , no matter
and in addition to personal overseas web shopping , machine translation can also be used for state @-@ level trade .
and it &apos;s useful in travelling , which is attractive to all of us .
when you are traveling abroad , carrying with you a machine translation software is like hiring an interpreter who can help us communicate with foreigners .
so machine translation has been applied in our lives in many aspects .
as depicted in the first picture , three Russians were lost and could not find their way home in China .
fortunately , they encountered a kind@@ hearted police officer . however , the officer cannot communicate with them in English .
what should they do in this case ?
the officer downloaded Baidu Trans@@ late , which supports translation between Russian and Chinese . only then did the police officer know that they were Russians and send them home .
the second picture tells a story involves a traffic officer and , coincid@@ entally , a rus@@ sian who violated traffic rules in Shenzhen .
the officer used our translation software to communicate with the traffic viol@@ ator and do his job .
in the third picture , a bus conductor found a wallet in the bus . through translation , he realized that the wallet belonged to a young man from Pakistan .
he therefore used Baidu Trans@@ late to communicate with this Pakistani and returned the wallet to him .
as you can see , Baidu Trans@@ late is genuinely helping us communicate with foreigners .
the following pictures show the comments that some internet users posted on Wei@@ bo and W@@ ech@@ at after they used Baidu Trans@@ late .
the first shows the scenario of foreign language learning . along with the translation of such a passage , Baidu Trans@@ late lists its key words and expressions .
the second is a case that a man lost his umbrella traveling in Thailand , but found it with the help of Baidu Trans@@ late .
the third shows users &apos; needs for chatting and socialization .
the fourth shows users &apos; needs for online overseas shopping .
the following three pictures are about camera translation , a combination of machine translation and O@@ CR , Optical Character recogn@@ tion .
these three pictures dem@@ o@@ strate the camera translation feature .
for example , many of you might have bought lots of thing@@ ss while traveling abroad . but you may not know how to use them for their instructions are in foreign languages .
in the first picture is the instruction of a rice cooker made in Japan . as you can see , it is written in Japanese .
apparently , we cannot use it if we do not understand Japanese .
having the instruction translated by taking a picture , we can know how to use it .
for example , it tells you whether you should use the provided cup to measure the rice . if you use other containers , measurement errors might occur .
such useful information is directly presented .
the second picture is about such a case that I went shopping abroad and saw something that I didn &apos;t know what it was . but I directly took a picture of it . with a finger wipe on the texts , I managed to know it was fish oil . in the same way , I was able to know how to use it , the daily dose and ingredients .
it is no doubt that Baidu Trans@@ late is of great help while we are shopping abroad .
the third picture is about the scenario of travelling ab@@ road@@ . for example , museums and tourist attractions abroad usually provide written introduc@@ tions .
we want to know about the history and culture of a foreign country , but we can not due to our ignorance of the local language .
this problem can also be solved by taking a picture .
for example , as in this picture , this buddy is visiting the Berlin Wall in Germany and seeing such an introduction passage on the wall , in German .
we can also take a picture of it , using Baidu Trans@@ late .
then we can know it &apos;s about the history of the Berlin Wall , its maintenance and its collapse .
in fact , we started building the core R &amp; D team of Baidu Trans@@ late in 2010 .
in June of 2011 , we launched the function of Chinese @-@ English translation , which can translate Chinese into English and vice versa .
in the following years , we expanded the number of languages to 28 , covering most countries and regions of the world .
in other words , it supports translation between any two of the 28 languages , that is , 7@@ 56 translation directions .
Baidu Trans@@ late is now responding to over 100 million requests each day , for translating poems , papers , product introduc@@ tions , social conversations , and cyber@@ words and other texts .
let me give you some of its typical application scenarios .
what exactly can we do with the help of Baidu Trans@@ late ?
we have opened the API of Baidu Trans@@ late , so third parties , for example , dictionary service websites including IC@@ I@@ BA and D@@ ict Hu@@ jiang , can easily call our translation API .
originally they only provide dictionary services , and can not handle sentences .
by calling the Baidu Trans@@ late API , they can be applied to meet more needs .
the second scenario is e @-@ commerce and foreign trade , which I have mentioned before .
we can use it to translate product names , details and addresses , not only from Chinese into other languages but vice versa .
thus we can shop easily , language @-@ barrier @-@ free .
thirdly , it can be applied in other utility applications . for example , we use the API as a plug @-@ in in our products like Baidu Brow@@ ser .
when we browse foreign web@@ pages , it will translate those pages into Chinese , so that we can easily gain a clue about their content ,
for example , news , information , fin@@ anc@@ e. we can bridge the language gap through Baidu Trans@@ late .
in addition , as I have mentioned , machine translation can be applied in conjunction with speech recognition .
we have speech translation , a practical feature that allows us directly speak to the AP@@ P . so we can talk to foreign friends in a more natural way .
besides , machine translation can also be combined with image recognition , enabling translation by taking a picture .
this is rather helpful when we cannot speak and type the local language while traveling abroad .
for example , when traveling in Thailand or en@@ countering something in Arabic that we cannot type , what should we do ?
we can take a picture of it .
when we see a guide@@ board or sign@@ post on the road , or a menu in a restaurant , we can take a picture of it and have it translated into our own language , so that we can read , understand and make decisions .
interestingly , machine translation can also be utilized to compose poems .
you might be intrigu@@ ed that why translation and writing poems are com@@ ap@@ r@@ able .
actually there are rules for poetry . there are word limit , rhyme and rhythm .
on the other hand , we can regard the process of poem writing as that of translation .
if the second line of a poem is generated based on the first line , the first line can be seen as the source language and the second line the target language . this is actually a process of translation .
we can generate the second line using the first line , and the third and fourth line in exactly the same way , until a poem is completed .
here are two poems , one written by human and the other by machine .
can you guess which one is written by human and which one by machine ?
OK I won &apos;t leave you hanging . the poem on the left is written by human and the right one comes from machine .
here are another two poems , one written by human and the other by machine .
on this occasion , the left one is written by an automatic poem generator and the right one by human .
did you guess right ?
in the development , we have two test groups , one composed of ordinary users and the other of Chinese linguistic experts .
we presented the ordinary users with two poems and asked them to tell which one is written by human and which one by machine .
only 50 % of them were able to give the right answer .
in other words , most people cannot tell the difference between poems produced by human and those by machine .
so the machine results are quite convincing .
nevertheless , 80 % of the expert group were able to tell the differences . so the experts are indeed experts . they can figure out whether a poem is written by human or machine .
machine poem writing is afflicted by shortcomings in artistic conception . so it still has a long way to go .
OK , this is all I want to share with you about the applications of Baidu Trans@@ late .
hello , everyone !
I am L@@ uan Shu@@ ai , a product manager from Baidu Du@@ er@@ OS division .
today I &apos;m going to bring you the Du@@ er@@ OS Open Platform Light@@ weight Device Solution Access Guide course .
hello , Du@@ er@@ OS developers !
here I will introduce the usage process of Du@@ er@@ OS lightweight device access scheme .
Du@@ er@@ OS provides developers with lightweight device access solutions .
you can use our partner modules , partner chips or development kits to quickly add the powerful voice interaction capabilities of Du@@ er@@ OS to your lightweight devices .
these capabilities include command control , information query , knowledge application , address navigation , life services , calendar remin@@ ders , chat entertainment and other more categories .
and they are now available to Du@@ er@@ OS developers for free .
with the lightweight device solution .
you can quickly and easily integrate configuration and manage Du@@ er@@ OS products .
next , let &apos;s take a look at the specific process .
the figure below shows the cycle of individual product development .
the product development stage refers that developers register and configure product information through the platform .
and complete the integration of the Du@@ er@@ OS SD@@ K on the device side .
at this point , the product can be connected to the cloud to obtain the voice interaction ability of the Du@@ er@@ OS .
so as to prepare for product demonstrations or formal mass production .
the platform also provides O@@ TA , running log , application configuration , statistical analysis , Du@@ er@@ OS service custom@@ ization and other functions .
which you can use at all stages of product development or launch .
if the developer &apos;s product needs to cooperate with the corresponding AP@@ P .
the platform also provides Andro@@ id SD@@ K and open API for controlling and managing the device .
and demo AP@@ P for early debugging and demonstration .
next , let &apos;s get into the platform
please use your Baidu account to log in Du@@ er@@ OS open platform .
apply to be a developer , and complete the developer certification according to the promp@@ ts on the page .
please make sure that the mobile phone number and email address have been bound with the Baidu account before the application for certification .
so that the platform can be used normally .
after the certification is submitted .
we will carefully review your information and give the console permissions to qualified developers .
after approval .
we can create a new product on the console by clicking &quot; create product . &quot;
and we can see the list of all devices supported by the current platform .
the scenarios that lightweight device solutions support include story machines , smart speakers , refriger@@ ators , smart household appliances , lightweight controlled equipment , and wear@@ able devices .
choose your device type .
let &apos;s take the story machine as an example .
on the m@@ bed OS platform , input the product name to enter the product console .
we provide access w@@ iz@@ ards for newly created products .
first , you need to set data points for the products .
the product data point is the unified definition of device , cloud , AP@@ P and communication data .
please set data points for your product based on its features and device attributes .
for example , the story machine will be set with several data points such as switch , play , volume and battery to transmit data , while data points such as switch .
mode , refrigerator temperature , freezer temperature and so on will be set for the refrigerator .
there are three types of data points .
the control data points refer to the control instructions sent from the cloud to the device , which are readable and writ@@ able .
query data points mean that the cloud sends a query request to the device .
which is read @-@ only .
report data points refer to the data reported by the device to the cloud .
the platform provides some typical device data point templates for developers to view and select .
you can also store your own list of data points as a template for use in subsequent products .
we choose to apply the data point template of the story machine .
after applying the template , we can still add , edit or delete data points according to our needs .
while adding data points , we need to provide following contents .
does it support voice interaction ?
we have prepared the template of voice interaction data points for you according to different devices .
all the data points in the template have completed semantic par@@ sing , semantic pol@@ ys@@ emy , control command conversion and other work .
so that the complete path of voice control devices can be directly obtained .
display name .
if the current data point is a speech data point , you can select a speech data point in the template .
if the current data point is a non @-@ speech data point , the display name of the data point can be defined as the name presented to the end users .
such as switch , battery , and current time .
you can select the data point category as control , query or report data points .
the identification name is the unique identifier of the data point in the developer &apos;s names@@ pace .
which distingu@@ ishes the data point from other data points .
data type .
currently , the system supports six data types which are Bo@@ ol@@ ean , integer , double @-@ precision floating point , enum@@ eration , string , and j@@ son .
data points of int and double must define a range of variations .
while enum@@ eration data points must define individual enum@@ eration values .
with user invisible remarks of some ancillary information defined by the developer for that data point .
next , I will elaborate on the template of voice data points .
at present , the platform has supported voice commands of several smart products such as story machine , portable smart speaker , refrigerator , rice cooker and soybean milk machine .
you can use voice command templates and add your own personalized data points .
for example , the built @-@ in play data points of the story machine can obtain common voice interaction capabilities such as children &apos;s story play resources , system portraits , weather , translation , and ency@@ clo@@ pedia .
however , the play data points in the speaker are integrated with voice interaction capabilities such as universal information , music , audio resources , children &apos;s stories , system portraits , weather , and universal information , etc .
for some smart small appliances .
the platform also provides different voice data point templates .
which can be used according to our platform access guide .
after the data points of the platform are set up , the data point test can start .
before completing device @-@ side development .
we need to get certain and valid product data points .
to facilitate quick verification by developers , we have generated a virtual device for each product .
developers can use demo AP@@ P provided by the platform to control this virtual device and quickly verify the effect of data point definitions .
which greatly speeds up development and reduces the complex workload of device @-@ side development .
click &quot; Start Virtual Device . &quot;
obtain the demo AP@@ P of the platform via the download link and then install it on Andro@@ id mobile phones .
log in the AP@@ P with Baidu account .
scan the Q@@ R code here and bind the virtual device .
then you can see the data point control interface of the virtual device on the demo AP@@ P .
all operations will be displayed in the form of log here .
after completing the data point test , you can proceed to the next device development .
this page prepares the development resources of the device side , including the software development package .
which is the device @-@ side SD@@ K and other resources required for device @-@ side development .
a Pro@@ file is an identity file for single device and contains basic information such as the device ID .
in the debugging stage , the platform provides 20 initial profiles for collaborative development .
the device description file is a code file automatically generated based on device data points .
and is convenient for developers to complete the function development of the data points according to the specified format .
for device @-@ side development , please refer to the device @-@ side development manual or the device @-@ side development tutorial provided by the platform .
click &quot; Fin@@ ish &quot; to exit the wizard .
you can also skip the wizard at any time and complete the above three steps on the production console .
on the product console .
developers can edit their own product names and view the Du@@ er@@ OS &quot; AP@@ P ID , AP@@ P Key , Baidu voice A@@ K and SK .
in the custom configuration , you can add some fields and write them together in the profile for developers to select according to their requirements .
after the developer has compiled , connected , and burned the firm@@ ware to the physical device .
the physical equipment can be verified by the demo AP@@ P .
in the right control device and data query sections .
find the device configuration file stored in the physical device in the drop @-@ down list .
which is the profile .
the platform generates the Q@@ R code of the device according to the profile .
in the demo AP@@ P , the device can be scanned and bound and controlled .
the verification method is the same as that of the virtual device .
devices that have completed device @-@ side development can apply for batches through the mass production interface .
and the developer can manage the batches according to the production time and software version of the device .
currently , the platform limits the production of the device up to 20 per batch , and a total of 10 batches can be applied .
if you have higher requirements , please contact the open platform of Du@@ er@@ OS .
click on the Cre@@ ate Bat@@ ch Case in the upper right corner to fill in the number of production equipment for the batch .
after the successful creation , you can directly download the profile of all the equipment of the batch in the batch list !
O@@ TA upgrade is a relatively efficient firm@@ ware upgrade method at present .
developers can conduct O@@ TA management on devices here .
O@@ TA upgrade function has been strictly checked to ensure that your device will not be tam@@ pered or upgraded by others .
click the &quot; add &quot; button .
fill in the version information of the device .
and upload the firm@@ ware file of the target version .
please complete the verification of the file before uplo@@ ading the firm@@ ware file to ensure that the firm@@ ware package can run normally .
in order to ensure the security of firm@@ ware files pushed on batch devices .
the platform provides the verification function of firm@@ ware files .
only approved firm@@ ware versions can issue O@@ TA instructions to bulk online devices .
click &quot; Ver@@ i@@ fy Now &quot; to use the device verification function .
input the device ID and click Ver@@ i@@ fy .
the platform will push the current firm@@ ware file to the device .
you can view the device push status in the list , and successfully pushed devices are manually verified by the developer .
if the device runs as expected .
click &quot; Verification Pass &quot; to indicate that the device has successfully completed the O@@ TA .
if there is an error , please click &quot; Verification F@@ ail . &quot;
if so , the O@@ TA fails .
when any device passes the verification of the current version of the O@@ TA process .
the firm@@ ware package is validated and can be distributed to more devices .
however , we strongly recommend you to verify each to @-@ be @-@ upgraded firm@@ ware version once before distributing them .
the verified firm@@ ware package can be released to the factory device to manage the O@@ TA through a publishing policy .
click &quot; Add Policy &quot; for the current firm@@ ware to add a release strategy .
each strategy can be configured with the following information .
including upgrade with no notification which means that the equipment will be upgraded with no reminder or user intervention .
and upgrade with user confirmation which means the upgrade information will be pushed to the cloud for the developers to set user validation rules .
the validity of release means that the release is valid within the date range and invalid on other dates .
the release period means that the release is valid during this time period of a day and invalid otherwise .
developers can schedule releases based on their users &apos; habits .
filtering old version .
developers can only update devices in the filtering old versions .
and multiple sel@@ ections of firm@@ ware versions are also supported .
batch screening .
developers can only update devices within the batch screening range , and multiple sel@@ ections of batches are also supported .
devices that belong to both ranges are the ones that the upgrade strategy covers this time .
after the policy is successfully added , the policy appears in the list .
it supports adding multiple policies , and starting or pa@@ using at any time .
you can also use this section of the interface to query the upgrade status of the device based on the device ID .
enter the device ID and click &quot; Qu@@ ery . &quot;
the running logs of all physical devices can be viewed in the running log page .
the developer can retrieve the running status of a single device according to the device ID and obtain all the logging information of the device through the &quot; View &quot; button on the right side of the running log .
all the control logs of the device will be displayed in the initial state .
and the reporting log of all devices can be viewed through the header switch .
with the application configuration function , developers can manage their individual applications .
after the application is associated with the product , it can interact with the data points of all hardware devices connected with the product .
if you want to create a new application .
you can click &quot; Cre@@ ate Application &quot; in the upper right corner .
and then enter an application name .
after clicking OK .
the system will assign an ID and a Key to the newly created application .
this ID and the Key are used to give an application permission to manipulate data points .
only applications that have the ID and the Key configured correctly can operate the data points .
at present , the platform has provided Andro@@ id SD@@ K and Open API .
developers need to fill in corresponding information to use them properly .
after filling , you can follow the Andro@@ id SD@@ K documentation or the Open API documentation to complete the AP@@ P development of the control device .
application binding means that the developer can bind or un@@ bind the current product in the list .
only the application bound to the product can control all the devices connected with the product .
the data statistics function provides manufacturers and developers with multi @-@ angle data statistics on the platform to understand the operation of their equipment .
the platform provides the ability to customize voice interaction content and Du@@ er@@ OS services .
which can be turned on or off by developers on Du@@ er@@ OS service custom@@ ization page .
these services include system portraits , ency@@ clo@@ pedia question and answer , weather , entertainment , voice control devices , chat , and more .
users can also customize the System Por@@ trait Service .

if you want to know more about it .
please log in to the Du@@ er@@ OS open platform and give us real @-@ time feedback .
thank you all !
hello , everyone !
today , I would like to introduce the operation of OL@@ AP system .
it &apos;s called Pal@@ o , a Baidu product .
basically , we have four parts to cover .
the first part is about the background of OL@@ AP Baidu .
we will also introduce some applicable scenarios and analyze several cases for your reference .
then , I will give a brief introduction of the collective architecture and some key features .
let me introduce Pal@@ o to you .
its name is actually the reverse of OL@@ AP .
Pal@@ o is an MP@@ P @-@ based database that supports SQL query .
it could deal with ter@@ bytes or even pe@@ tab@@ y@@ tes of data , mainly structured data and it supports responses on mill@@ is@@ ec@@ ond to second level .
it was developed by the big data department of Baidu , and it is now widely used within Baidu .
it has been deployed on more than 1,000 internal computers so far , and the largest business may have reached the level of over 100 TB .
we often hear about OL@@ TP .
what is OL@@ AP , then ?
OL@@ AP means online analytical processing .
here is a table , which shows the comparison between OL@@ TP and OL@@ AP .
we can learn more about it .
OL@@ TP , in terms of its application , is mainly used for processing daily transactions , while OL@@ AP is used for scenarios with a large amount of data , such as query and decision analysis .
as for access patterns , OL@@ TP is used for small batch queries and OL@@ AP is used for complex scenarios , such as consolidation , drill @-@ up and drill @-@ down .
OL@@ TP has a small amount of data in terms of data quantity , usually the most recent data , but OL@@ TP has access to a large amount of data .
there are different versions of OL@@ TP , so you need to do some back@@ tracking of historical data and analyze historical trends .
in terms of data update and organization , OL@@ TP data is updated in real time .
it has data and architecture , following the paradigm requirements of the database domain .
OL@@ AP data is basically updated in batches .
it is rarely updated item by item .
its architecture mainly includes models under some well @-@ known analysis scenarios such as the information model .
the difference between Online and Off@@ line mainly lies in the response time .
online emphasizes timely response and results .
as for Off@@ line , analysis tools such as Had@@ oop do not place much emphasis on response time .
let us take a look at some of the OL@@ AP systems commonly used in the industry .
OL@@ AP systems were previously monopol@@ ized by commercial companies .
in recent years , with the development of big data technology , especially the development of Had@@ oop community , there are some open source products .
some are cloud @-@ based products .
Google and Amazon launched OL@@ AP products based on the cloud .
Pal@@ o is an OL@@ AP product .
here is its positioning logic .
Pal@@ o is a low @-@ cost product with linear scal@@ ability .
it supports cloud deployment .
Pal@@ o is already available on Baidu &apos;s open cloud , and users outside the company can also try it .
Pal@@ o is highly available with high performance , with a target of 100,000 Q@@ PS .
it can scan clusters of 100@@ g per second .
it can import clusters of 10@@ TB per hour .
after its background , let us move on to some scenarios of Pal@@ o and typical cases in Baidu , about its internal production line , for your reference .
you can consider our Pal@@ o if you are dealing with similar scenarios .
it is suitable for the scenarios of data statistics and analysis .
to be more specific , there are two major types of scenarios .
reports and multi @-@ dimensional analysis .
what was the solution before Pal@@ o ?
in terms of statements and reports , you schedule your task with cr@@ on and run it everyday , and then import the final result into My@@ SQL .
why is this the final result ?
My@@ SQL has limited performance when dealing with large amounts of data , so you can only factor in the final result .
after getting the result , the user may make the query and get the final result by mail or other means .
however , there is a problem .
whether you set up a cr@@ on job or import the final results into My@@ SQL , there will be many tables and tasks , of which the cost of maintenance can be very high .
moreover , the reliability and efficiency often fall short of the requirements .
users were not very satisfied .
multidimensional analysis is generally used in scenarios such as Had@@ oop + H@@ ive .
if you want better timeliness , you can consider Pal@@ o .
here are some examples of how Baidu implements Pal@@ o in our internal products .
the first is Baidu Statistics , which uses Pal@@ o for reporting .
this page is about Baidu Statistics .
you may have heard about it .
it is a professional website analysis tool provided by Baidu .
here is the application scenario .
it imports more than 300 tables every five minutes .
the maximum amount of data in a single day is more than 1 TB ， Peak Q@@ PS for queries per second was 2,000 .
before the introduction of Pal@@ o , when we moved from other systems to Pal@@ o , we reduced the number of computers from more than 220 to around 50 .
the average response time has been reduced from 60 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds to 30 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds after moving to Pal@@ o .
this is a screen@@ shot of a report using Pal@@ o for Baidu Statistics .
on the left are the analysis dimensions and indicators of customized PV and traffic .
reports are generated daily when you make the switch .
the next one is the application of multidimensional analysis in Baidu W@@ aim@@ ai .
Baidu W@@ aim@@ ai has an internal data platform , which uses the Pal@@ o engine .
its operation team need to analyze orders , merchants and the sales@@ people .
it is characterized by custom@@ izable dimensions .
this is a typical multi @-@ dimensional analysis scenario .
you could customize the dimensions and once the dimensions specified , you can get the analysis results in real time .
this is very helpful for upstream decision @-@ making .
the next one is Nu@@ om@@ i , which is an internal data mart product using our Pal@@ o engine in the lowest layer .
it contains much more and has also the need for reporting and analysis .
after using Pal@@ o , it went from the previous minute level to the second level .
there are other typical cases apart from applicable Pal@@ o scenarios .
if you have similar needs , Pal@@ o may be an option for you .
now , let us learn something about the overall architecture and some key technical features of Pal@@ o .
it allows our users to be better acquainted with it and help with their future use of Pal@@ o .
as for its architecture , upper users only need experience with My@@ SQL to carry out simple tasks , because Pal@@ o supports My@@ SQL protocol .
Pal@@ o is divided into two layers of FE and BE .
Fe is responsible for metadata , query analysis , planning execution and task scheduling .
be is responsible for data allocation , multiple copies , query execution and data scanning .
what I want to say is that we have multiple F@@ Es to support high availability of metadata .
any F is in between any number of F@@ Es .
raft @-@ like protocols enables high availability of metadata .
when the pressure is high and there is a performance bottleneck , the availability of FE can be improved by horizontal linear scaling .
this is only a brief introduction of the structure .
we can talk about the technical details later .
let us move on to some technical features of Pal@@ o .
users only need experience with My@@ SQL , because Pal@@ o supports My@@ SQL protocol .
there are several major advantages to supporting the My@@ SQL protocol .
fir@@ s , users may find that the learning curve is pretty low .
Pal@@ o is easily compatible with higher @-@ level applications - such as the user application J@@ D@@ BC - via OR O@@ D@@ BC .
the cost of system switching is very low .
it also makes it easy to connect with common BI tools on the market , such as T@@ able@@ au , S@@ ai@@ ku and Q@@ li@@ k .
you can use some of the My@@ SQL @-@ related tools directly .
in terms of application , people with My@@ SQL experience can easily use Pal@@ o .
after specifying the machine port with My@@ SQL , users with the password can connect to Pal@@ o .
what the user sees is My@@ SQL , but behind the scenes is Pal@@ o , not the My@@ SQL server .
what the user sees is My@@ SQL , but behind the scenes is Pal@@ o , not the My@@ SQL server .
this is the progress query of Show Lo@@ ad .
at the bottom is the select SQL query , which is basically the same as My@@ SQL .
a parallel database , a large OL@@ AP database or non @-@ OL@@ AP database needs to be highly available .
as we mentioned , metadata is highly available between F@@ Es and is maintained by protocols similar to RA@@ FT .
how to achieve high availability of data , then ?
first of all , there are multiple copies of data , which can be automatically replen@@ ished and balanced .
here is a brief introduction of our FE metadata as to its high availability .
we will not elaborate here .
now let &apos;s talk about a very important data model of Pal@@ o , a typical model you should pay attention to when using Pal@@ o .
let us say , we have a table containing such five columns as Time , ID , country , clicks and cost .
there are Key columns and Value columns in Pal@@ o .
the first three columns are Key columns , and the last two are Value columns .
PA &apos;s underlying storage of all Key columns in Pal@@ o is ordered , which enables fast positioning and searching , a binary search that all of you understand .
all Key columns are unique in Pal@@ o &apos;s internal storage .
for data imported in multiple batches , if the Key column is the same , the Value column is automatically aggregated .
the aggregation mode for the Value column can be specified , where Value columns with the same Key column will be automatically aggregated .
for example , you import a batch of data every five minutes , you can import more than 280 times a day .
if you don &apos;t have automatic aggregation , the same Key is going to generate at least 280 pieces of data .
then when you analyze de @-@ aggregation , you have to aggregate the 280 pieces of data in real time .
with Pal@@ o , the data you import is automatically aggregated , so the query is very efficient .
in another scenario , suppose you have a Base table , containing three pieces of data .
you import another batch of data , and we call it Delta .
it is incremental data .
it will merge with the same existing Key , and different keys will be added .
so this will produce a result containing four pieces of data .
as for previous Value columns , they are aggregated by means of sum@@ mation .
they will aggregate automatically .
for other PA , one advantage of Pal@@ o in internal storage engine is that it also supports materi@@ alized views .
on the left is the basic data , raw data .
once it &apos;s imported into Pal@@ o , there will be a base table generated .
as we said , Pal@@ o is sorted by the Key column , so its order will change a little bit .
assuming that the user queries only the ID and PV columns , not the time and province columns , you can create a materi@@ alized view with fewer columns .
this forms an aggregate table with only ID and PV columns .
if the user does not need the time column and the province column when quer@@ ying , the aggregate table can respond directly for higher speed .
of course , it also has a disadvantage .
the materi@@ alized views take up a small amount of data space .
we need to balance that a little bit in production .
by the way , the materi@@ alized view is automatically updated when imported , automatically located and selected when you query , without any additional user intervention .
let us move on to other important features of Pal@@ o in terms of storage .
first of all , it supports column and row storage .
what is the advantage of column storage ?
first , when you query and if there is only part of columns , not all columns , the amount of data to be scanned is relatively small since the data of each column is stored separately .
in addition , when you put data of each column together - as the data format is the same - it is very convenient for us to compress the data during storage and reduces the space occupied .
Pal@@ o supports parti@@ tioning into two layers .
what is parti@@ tioning ?
a large processing system always distribu@@ tes data across multiple computers .
how to partition the two layers ?
what is the advantage of it compared to the traditional one @-@ layer partition ?
two layers of Pal@@ o make it easy to isolate old and new data .
for example , in the first layer , we distinguish the data by time , so that the new data will be imported into the new partition , and the old data will stay in the old partition .
this saves a lot of history data and reduces the unnecessary merging of background or back @-@ end storage in the storage engine , as well as IO overhead .
it also simpli@@ fies the expansion of the table .
why is that ?
in the case of the one @-@ layer partition , the common H@@ ash partition , if you want to reduce the amount of data per bucket when data is increasing and you can &apos;t handle it , you have to increase the partition .
however , the cost of adding bu@@ ckets is very high , because you need to rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ate all the data for bu@@ ckets .
with two @-@ layer partition , as the data continues to grow , you just need to adjust the number of bu@@ ckets based on the internal two @-@ layer parti@@ tioning when building one @-@ layer partition .
the SQL is an example for two @-@ layer partition .
first of all , it was parti@@ tioned in the dimension of time , and each layer was divided into 32 bu@@ ckets .
it is an example for two @-@ layer partition , a syntax example .
Pal@@ o also supports hierarchical storage .
what is hierarchical storage ?
currently , there are both SS@@ Ds and mechanical hard drives on servers .
we want to use SS@@ Ds because of its high performance , but it has small capacity , so we have to use mechanical drives at the same time .
on the other hand , when quer@@ ying - data can be divided into new data and old data - the probability of new data being quer@@ ied is much higher than that of old data .
so we can put new data on SS@@ Ds and the old data on the mechanical hard drive .
however , artificial migration of the data is costly .
Pal@@ o supports the automatic migration of these data between SS@@ DS and mechanical hard drive .
let us talk about practice , including how to achieve superior performance of Pal@@ o as well as its features .
as we mentioned , Pal@@ o is a MP@@ P execution engine .
what is MP@@ P ?
MP@@ P refers to M@@ assi@@ vely Par@@ allel Processing .
it &apos;s central to Pal@@ o &apos;s ability to achieve high performance .
Pal@@ o , on the other hand , supports vec@@ tor@@ ized execution .
vec@@ tor@@ ized execution is actually an underlying optimization .
it reduces CPU pipeline execution and is friendly to branch prediction .
in addition , as it is distributed execution , Pal@@ o also supports the commonly used Mer@@ ge @-@ S@@ ort .
that is to say , when sorting large @-@ scale data , it can help merge and sort among multiple nodes .
this provides good performance in data sorting .
for large @-@ scale aggre@@ g@@ ations and sor@@ tings , Pal@@ o allows these data to be placed in order if there is insufficient memory .
there is another problem even though the execution and storage is pretty good .
queries may interact when multiple users are using the same cluster .
for one user , interactions may exist between different queries , between different imports , and between the queries and imports .
why ?
system resources are limited .
when a large query is executed other queries may be affected .
Pal@@ o provides a whole set of resource isolation solutions .
simply put , Pal@@ o supports setting priorities , such as High , Low , and Normal .
to ensure that queries are executed and all resources are appropriately allocated , with small queries allowed for .
in fact , this is implemented based on C@@ Group internally .
the detailed solution to resource isolation is still being refined and will be better in the next release .
OK , let us just leave it there .
here is a brief introduction .
it is about the import and export functions of Pal@@ o .
it supports a variety of ways to import data , whether it &apos;s on Had@@ oop , a local disk or on B@@ OS .
all these data can be imported to our Pal@@ o system .
there is another scenario where it also supports multi @-@ table import atomic validation .
multi @-@ table import by atomic means is often necessary in business to help users achieve multi @-@ table consistency .
exports are similar to imports .
Pal@@ o also supports exporting to a variety of data destinations , including Had@@ oop and B@@ OS .
as we know that Pal@@ o is a partial OL@@ AP and commonly used in scenarios such as statement analysis .
as for the scenarios you analyzed , it also strengthens SQL , as some aug@@ mentation .
it is noteworthy that Pal@@ o supports window functions , which is very helpful for those with analytical experience and which makes ranking and sequential calculations easier and more efficient .
for example , without a window function , it &apos;s hard to quickly find the three highest @-@ paid people in the same department .
you can give it a try .
in addition , it is designed to improve usability for users .
you can simply use My@@ SQ@@ LC@@ li@@ ent to connect to our server and view the help information easily .
it uses the same syntax as My@@ SQL .
for example , if you want to see the import , use Help Lo@@ ad .
in this way , users do not have to switch between different help documents and web pages frequently , so it is convenient and user @-@ friendly .
so that &apos;s the basics of Pal@@ o .
here is our contact information .
Pal@@ o has been logged into the Baidu open cloud , and this link allows you to access the cloud and learn more about our products and their fuc@@ n@@ tions .

thank you !
hi !
I am Yi Gu@@ ol@@ ei , an engineer from Baidu .
today we will talk about El@@ as@@ tic@@ search , an open source software , and its application in Baidu .
there are three parts for this session today , including the concepts and rationale of El@@ as@@ tic@@ search , some typical usage scenarios of it .
as well as some improvements made by Baidu in its use of El@@ as@@ tic@@ search .
let &apos;s first look at the concept and rationale of El@@ as@@ tic@@ search .
El@@ as@@ tic@@ search is a distributed search engine based on Luc@@ ene .
Luc@@ ene is a common open source document retrieval engine that you may be familiar with .
many companies are using Luc@@ ene for documents or web search and analysis .
El@@ as@@ tic@@ search is built on Luc@@ ene , so it also has full @-@ text search capabilities .
at the same time , El@@ as@@ tic@@ search builds a layer of distributed indexes on top of Luc@@ ene , so it can expand to many nodes .
from our usage scenario , it can be extended to hundreds of nodes , supporting pe@@ tab@@ y@@ tes of data .
in 2010 , the first version of El@@ as@@ tic@@ search was launched , with version 1.0 released in 2012 .
version 6.@@ 0 was released in 20@@ 17 .
judging from its release speed , El@@ as@@ tic@@ search is a popular open @-@ source software .
elastic was founded in 2012 , greatly accelerating the development of El@@ as@@ tic@@ search .
El@@ as@@ tic@@ search has deployed with over 70 businesses across Baidu with over 400 physical computers .
the business scope is wide .
Baidu Wang@@ Meng , Nu@@ om@@ i and Du Xia@@ om@@ an Financial are all using El@@ as@@ tic@@ search for log analysis and retrieval .
El@@ as@@ tic@@ search has not only been widely used in Baidu , but also beyond Baidu such as G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b , St@@ ack@@ overflow , U@@ ber and Facebook , which our R &amp; D personnel are quite familiar with .
G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b uses El@@ as@@ tic@@ search for its rep@@ o and source code management , as well as some audit log analysis and inquiry .
it stores about 30@@ t of data .
in its January database rankings , El@@ as@@ tic@@ search ranks 11th , beating good traditional databases such as H@@ Base and Mari@@ a@@ D@@ B .
judging from this ranking , El@@ as@@ tic@@ search is popular among customers .
there are five key concepts of El@@ as@@ tic@@ search , including Index , Sh@@ ard , Document , Type and Field .
index is a collection of documents , similar to Database .
sh@@ ard groups all documents by ID , where H@@ ash grouping is used .
the document in El@@ as@@ tic@@ search is j@@ son document , as is known to all of you .
a Field in El@@ as@@ tic@@ search - every field in a j@@ son document is called a &quot; Field &quot; - is similar to a Col@@ umn in a database table .
type is a logical partition in the Index .
it means that there may be multiple types of documents in the Index , and each document has a Type , and a Type contains many F@@ iel@@ ds .
what is Index , then ?
El@@ as@@ tic@@ search offers RE@@ ST API to all outside API and is very developer friendly .
if you want to create a document with three sh@@ ards and two copies , the Index of test is divided into three parts , each with two copies .
the Sh@@ ard for test@@ 1 is stored on No@@ de@@ 1 and No@@ de@@ 4 .
when storing a document on Index , we pass El@@ as@@ tic@@ search a j@@ son document via the RE@@ ST API .
for example , the name is y@@ ig@@ u@@ ol@@ ei and the age is 29 .
it simply does a H@@ ash grouping with this ID .
assuming the result is 1 , it is stored on the Sh@@ ard 1 , and El@@ as@@ tic@@ search will automatically enter this document into the two physical nodes of No@@ de@@ 1 and No@@ de@@ 4 for storage .
when we make the query , the query statement is also expressed in j@@ son .
if you want to find information about anyone aged 29 , El@@ as@@ tic@@ search will distribute retrieval requests to all of the physical nodes because it does know what node to begin with for the retrieval .
then it gathers them on a single Client node and returns them to the user .
from the point of view of ecosystem , El@@ as@@ tic@@ search is already compatible with many ecosystems .
for example , the data of traditional databases such as My@@ SQL and Oracle can be imported to El@@ as@@ tic@@ search .
the ecosystem of the new Had@@ oop is also compatible with El@@ as@@ tic@@ search .
it offers a unified j@@ son query mode for users to use .
let us move on to some typical application scenarios of El@@ as@@ tic@@ search for your choice .
the first one is log analysis service .
imagine a company with thousands of servers , each printing a large number of logs .
when retri@@ eving logs containing r@@ p@@ c time@@ out or ER@@ R@@ OR .
the traditional approach is to write some gre@@ p scripts , distribute it on various physical machines or transfer logs to HD@@ FS for analysis by SP@@ AR@@ K or M@@ ap@@ Re@@ duce .
in the first case , scrip@@ ting is complex and gre@@ p is inefficient .
HD@@ FS takes a lot of time to transmit , with poor timeliness .
the analysis efficiency of M@@ ap@@ Re@@ duce is low .
analyzing an error can take several minutes .
El@@ as@@ tic@@ search can accelerate this process considerably .
El@@ as@@ tic@@ search has a very popular set of architecture in the community .
el@@ k architecture .
e means El@@ as@@ tic@@ search , used for storing index .
l refers to Log@@ st@@ ash , responsible for getting data from each physical machine and store it in El@@ as@@ tic@@ search .
El@@ as@@ tic@@ search indexes these logs .
K refers to Ki@@ ban@@ a , mainly used for visual analysis .
users can write any search criteria , and Ki@@ ban@@ a can retrieve any log that matches the criteria and present a visual report .
the second scenario is a secondary ind@@ exing .
secondary ind@@ exing mainly serves traditional databases , such as My@@ SQL and Oracle , as well as the very popular No@@ SQL databases such as H@@ Base .
users mainly use El@@ as@@ tic@@ search because My@@ SQL and H@@ Base have poor ind@@ exing capabilities .
if a table has more than ten index fields , My@@ SQL is very inefficient when inser@@ ting it .
moreover , when the amount of data is large , My@@ SQL needs shar@@ ding .
after that , My@@ SQL had weak support for MP@@ P when users search .
Baidu usually stores its data in My@@ SQL and then syn@@ cs its database changes to El@@ as@@ tic@@ search .
the synchronization process can be done with the mature C@@ DC software .
in this architecture , My@@ SQL can provide transaction mediation or backup schemes .
it may also serve as a de @-@ escalation scheme when El@@ as@@ tic@@ search crashes .
the third usage scenario is tag analysis .
at present , user person@@ a technology is very popular .
we attach many labels to users in their person@@ a , such as &quot; Beijing , &quot; &quot; male , &quot; &quot; with an apartment &quot; or &quot; he works in the IT industry . &quot;
where there are many labels - say scores , hundreds or even thousands of them - based on which persons must be retrieved , the retrieval ability of traditional database is very weak .
El@@ as@@ tic@@ search stores all labels as a set .
you can search the set .
for example , if we search three labels : male , IT and Beijing , we can set conditions that people must meet three or part of the labels .
I would also like to talk about the improvement of El@@ as@@ tic@@ search by Baidu .
while using El@@ as@@ tic@@ search , we encountered two main problems , design and the lack of function .
there are three aspects of the design problem .
first of all , the metadata is unreliable , causing split @-@ brain sometimes .
maybe the possible community is on E and El@@ as@@ tic@@ search G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b , and Many people in the open source community have reported this problem .
the second aspect is that multiple copies of data are inconsistent , often resulting in data loss .
the third part is that the query language is too complex .
El@@ as@@ tic@@ search provides j@@ son as a query language that is still complex to many database practitioners .
in the P@@ PT example , if you only want to query for sum such as aggregation in P@@ PT .
El@@ as@@ tic@@ search needs to write a very large j@@ son query .
you may always need to look up the manual when using El@@ as@@ tic@@ search .
lack of function relates to permission management .
as El@@ as@@ tic@@ search has no management permission , there is a lot of El@@ as@@ tic@@ search data stolen in the previous stage .
later there are It does not support Online Schem@@ a Change .
if a field does not have an index at first , it cannot be built again later .
it also has no multi @-@ tenant management function .
here are some examples showing the improvement .
the first is split @-@ brain .
we have thought about it for a long time and finally decided to introduce Distribu@@ ted Lo@@ g as a log solution .
in this solution , all changes in El@@ as@@ tic@@ search Master are written to the Distribu@@ ted Lo@@ g as a Lo@@ g .
each Data No@@ de , along with the other Master nodes , gets the changes from the Distribu@@ ted Lo@@ g and writes them locally .
in this way , the metadata seen by each node can be guaranteed to be the same without split @-@ brain .
the second is the complexity of j@@ son query language .
we directly introduced a distributed SQL query layer and added support for the My@@ SQL connection protocol on top of it .
El@@ as@@ tic@@ search users can easily send SQL queries via My@@ SQL Client .
at the same time , we also added some functions in the SQL layer , so that users can directly use My@@ SQL Client to send HT@@ TP queries .
as for the original HT@@ TP query method , users can also send SQL directly over HT@@ TP and get the result in j@@ son , which is very convenient .
for permission management , we have made some transformation .
we think each Index name in El@@ as@@ tic@@ search is composed of two parts .
the name of Database and the name of Table .
users can authorize databases and tables , respectively .
for example , if you &apos;re creating a US@@ ER , you can just write C@@ RE@@ ATE US@@ ER ID@@ ENT@@ IF@@ I@@ ED in our SQL .
to authorize D@@ B , we need to GR@@ ANT a permission name .
for example , RE@@ AD _ W@@ R@@ ITE or RE@@ AD _ ON@@ LY , ON the database TO a user name .
El@@ as@@ tic@@ search &apos;s architecture is very clear after the transformation .
both the metadata and data are synchronized via the Distribu@@ ted Lo@@ g .
users can access El@@ as@@ tic@@ search service via My@@ SQL Client , HT@@ TP Client or the traditional J@@ D@@ BC .
that is all for today .
thank you !
hello everyone !
I am a product manager from Baidu .
today we will introduce the Baidu O@@ CR .
there are two main topics in today &apos;s lesson .
the first is a basic introduction to O@@ CR .
the second concerns the application scenarios for O@@ CR .
first , let &apos;s answer the question &apos; what is O@@ CR ? &apos;
O@@ CR is Optical Character Recognition .
one of our AI technologies .
whose main function is to enable a computer to recognize and read text in images .
for example , here we have an image with text in it .
we can use O@@ CR technology to detect and recognize the text , and then output it in an ed@@ itable format .
this is the process of O@@ CR .
now , let &apos;s take a look at Baidu O@@ CR .
Baidu O@@ CR is based on industry @-@ leading deep learning technology .
it offers functions such as full text detection , location , and recognition for images in a variety of scenarios .
O@@ CR is not only useful in printed text recognition situations where the user would otherwise have to manually input the text , such as invoices , ID cards , bank cards , etc .
but also in scenarios such as anti @-@ cheating , street view anno@@ tation , recognition of video sub@@ titles , recognition of news titles , and recognition of homework questions in the education industry .
Baidu O@@ CR is based on Baidu &apos;s deep learning technology .
which serves our tens of millions of PV product groups .
each day , vast amounts of PV data are generated , which in turn helps to optimize and improve our deep learning algorithms .
Baidu &apos;s O@@ CR technology has achieved many &quot; world fir@@ sts &quot; in the IC@@ D@@ AR competition for open dat@@ as@@ et indicators .
and our results are far ahead of our competitors .
at this stage , we are primarily focused on two aspects of capability provision .
the first is general text recognition .
while the second is vertical scenario text recognition .
General text recognition can recognize text in any scenario .
so , if we take a picture on the street such as a street sign , or a piece of text , or a piece of text on a book or on a screen , all of these texts can be recognized .
this is our general O@@ CR , which you can use to recognize image text in any scenario .
our general O@@ CR supports the recognition of ten languages , including Chinese , English , Japanese and Korean , with an average processing time of about five hundred mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds .
with clear images that have no obvious tilt or back@@ lighting .
the recognition accuracy is over 90 % .
the other capability that we are focusing on is vertical scenario text recognition .
here we support vertical scenario text recognition in cases such as ID cards , bank cards , driving licenses , license plates , and business licenses .
for example , the recognition accuracy for ID cards and bank cards is already over 98 % .
we are now working with developers , enterprises and other partners .
internally , we now support more than 110 product lines , including Baidu Mobile , Baidu Wal@@ let , Baidu M@@ aps and Baidu Nu@@ om@@ i .
let &apos;s take a closer look at the features of Baidu O@@ CR .
Baidu O@@ CR &apos;s main advantages are high accuracy , maturity and stability , ease of use , and stable efficiency .
now , we &apos;ll look at how our O@@ CR is made available to the public .
currently there are three interfaces for different functions that have been made publicly available .
the first is our general O@@ CR .
as we just discussed , the general O@@ CR can recognize image text in any scenario .
alongside the general O@@ CR , we also offer ID card O@@ CR and bank card O@@ CR , which , with a recognition rate of more than 98 % , can be directly applied .
in the future , we will also offer publicly available O@@ CR technology in various other scenarios , such as driver &apos;s licenses , license plates and business licenses .
for now our application scenarios cover finance , advertising , invoices , education , traffic , translation and more .
next we will give an example and introduction for each scenario .
first , let &apos;s consider O@@ CR in a finance scenario .
the first application in finance is in allowing us to recognize ID cards , bank cards , driver &apos;s licenses , business licenses , etc .
the second application is that we can now recognize documents such as annual financial reports , financial statements , and various contracts .
for example , let &apos;s look at the picture on the left showing text recognition for ID cards and bank cards .
here we have an ID card and on the right side is the text recognition result .
it is the same with bank cards .
O@@ CR can directly recognize the content of our bank cards .
two different ways of implementation are supported : a cloud API and a local SD@@ K , either of which can be used .
as mentioned earlier , the recognition accuracy is over 98 % .
let &apos;s take a look at the picture on the right .
the top part on the right is a document , the text which can be translated into online text .
the bottom part is a report , which can be out@@ put@@ ted as a text document or an excel form .
we are currently discussing potential for cooperation with companies from the banking and insurance industries .
as well as some accounting firms who also require text recognition services for licenses , documents or reports .
next , let &apos;s consider a second scenario : anti @-@ cheating .
in the anti @-@ cheating scenario , we can recognize text in images and videos , and then make an anti @-@ cheating judgment .
for example , let &apos;s take a look at the images on the bottom left .
the one on the far left is a normal picture and to its right is a cheating picture .
for example , if there is a paragraph of text on the picture saying &quot; The Q@@ Q for certificate handling is XX@@ X . &quot;
using the O@@ CR technology , we can recognize the text information and make the anti @-@ cheating judgment .
now let &apos;s take a look at the image on the right .
there is a video on the right side which contains text .
in the past , we could only recognize this with the human eyes .
now we can take screen@@ shots and analyze the text in the video using O@@ CR .
now , let &apos;s look at the picture on the far right .
this could be an av@@ atar uploaded by a user , or a picture uploaded to a forum or to We@@ Chat Mom@@ ents , which contains some information violating the relevant terms of use .
now we would be able to identify this and make a judgment .
we are already working with Ku@@ a@@ ish@@ ou , Y@@ Y , G@@ ome online , and others in this regard .
within Baidu , we are applying this technology to our image search , advertising and Baidu Ti@@ e@@ ba platforms .
the results are already clear , and this technology is already playing an important role in our risk monitoring .
next , let &apos;s look at the bill scenario .
in this area , we are mainly concerned with assisting in the input of large numbers of bills in the context of insurance , medical care , e @-@ commerce , finance and other fields requiring the entry of a large number of bills .
let &apos;s take a look at the following example .
below is an inspection report , with the original on the left and our inspection result on the right , from which you can see the result of our text recognition .
we are currently also working with some insurance companies and medical institutions , and the results have been very good .
next , let &apos;s look at a scenario of taking a picture of a homework question .
the question shooting is mainly used by students who need to look up some questions or formulas when doing homework .
teachers can also use this technology when correcting the exam papers or homework .
we can use O@@ CR technology to recognize these questions and formulas .
and then quickly launch entry or search functions for them .
we are currently cooperating with P@@ ig@@ ai@@ wang and other similar companies .
our next scenario is traffic .
in the context of traffic , we are currently working with Baidu M@@ aps .
this is mainly about recognizing information within maps , such as street signs , license plates , and door numbers .
once the text has been recognized .
we can mark the relevant information on the map to facilitate the anno@@ tation of our Street View .
at the same time , we also support the recognition of driver &apos;s licenses and license plates to help users input information quickly .
next is our video scenario .
in the past , if there was a lot of text information in a video , such as sub@@ titles or news headlines .
we had to manually translate or identify them@@ .This was particularly difficult .
now , with O@@ CR technology , we can quickly annot@@ ate text and news headlines in the video .
this makes annot@@ ating , docum@@ enting and searching of the videos all possible .
now we are currently discussing cooperation opportunities with CCTV and the National Radio and Television Administration .
discussions are ongoing .
the next application scenario is in the field of translation and dictionaries .
in terms of translation , our Baidu Translation , Baidu Dictionary and Baidu Mobile already have some related functions .
for example , if we have some hand@@ written or printed text that needs to be translated .
we can take a photo with our mobile phone and then d@@ oo@@ dle or frame it before translating the information .
as well as the translation function .
we also have an interface that contains rarely @-@ used Chinese characters .
this interface supports the recognition of more than 20,000 characters , and some of the more common rarely @-@ used characters can be identified .
if you want to try out our O@@ CR function , just enter our ai@@ .@@ ba@@ id@@ u@@ .com and give it a try .
some of our public interfaces and dem@@ os are available on the webpage .
so you can directly try them online .
that &apos;s all for today &apos;s class .
thank you everybody !
hello everyone !
today &apos;s lesson is about general image understanding technology and its applications .
I &apos;m Liu Xiao from Baidu &apos;s Institute of Deep Learning , or ID@@ L for short .
my group is called the Gen@@ ome Group .
we invented the world &apos;s first semantic @-@ based similar image retrieval system , which was awarded Baidu &apos;s highest award in 20@@ 14 .
our business covers various areas such as image classification , segmentation , smart question answering , and image quality .
let &apos;s begin by introducing the basics of image recognition .
what is image recognition ?
we can now see an image on the screen .
as a person , we may ask some questions , such as , what is in this picture ?
is it a dog ?
is it a big tree ?
or is it a car , a bicycle , a bridge , etc . ?
now , of course , we can actually give the answer : this is a picture of a car .
taking this a step further , we may want to know whether it is a BMW , a B@@ Y@@ D , or a Mercedes , or is it something else ?
now , here we can actually know that it is a BMW .
but then another question we may want to answer is whether there is a car show model in the picture .
the answer is no .
another question might be &apos; how much is this car worth ? &apos;
if we are familiar with this car , we will know that it sells for around 300,000 RMB .
so , in fact , we have asked ourselves three different questions .
what is the car in this picture ?
is there a car show model in it ?
how much is the car worth ?
these three questions correspond to the three basic subjects in image recognition , which are classification , detection and regression .
classification corresponds to the question &quot; what is ... ? &quot;
in fact , when we as human beings ask what a picture is , we are dealing with an issue of picture classification .
the second subject is detection .
detection concerns wanting to know if there is something in a picture and where it is .
such a question is called detection in the field of computer vision .
the third subject is regression , which means that we want to know if there is a numerical solution that can be derived from a picture .
for example , how much the car is worth , or how old a person is .
this is called regression .
so what are the practical applications of these three subjects ?
the first is image classification .
now we can see a lot of pictures on the screen , including animals , plants , signs and so on .
so how about we let the computer replace us human beings and tell users which categories the pictures belong to .
this process is called general image classification .
so what is image detection ?
let &apos;s look at the screen now .
for the objects shown on the screen including ships , birds , airplanes , chairs , people , etc . , the computer works out their positions and tells us where they are .
this process is called the detection of objects in an image .
let &apos;s watch this short video .
this video is generated with a camera moving at high speed in a very crowded traffic area .
the computer can detect any vehicles that appear in the video in real time .
this method is a core component of Baidu &apos;s dri@@ ver@@ less car technology as well as being an application of image detection .
next , let &apos;s look at image segmentation .
image segmentation concerns the situation where we input an image into a computer and we want to know which semantic category each pixel in the image belongs to .
for example , does it belong to the semantic category of motorcycle , or person , or car ?
we want the computer to distinguish such points from the entire picture .
this process is called image segmentation .
here is another video .
the video shows one of our colleagues sitting in our office cu@@ bic@@ le .
as the camera ( in this case , a phone ) moves , we can see that our technology can help differentiate him from the background in real time .
next up let &apos;s consider a basic application of image recognition called picture question answering .
this refers to the situation where we input an image , and also want to ask some questions about the image .
for example , we might ask : &quot; what color is the vehicle in this picture ? &quot;
we want the computer to answer : &quot; it is yellow . &quot;
so for this kind of process , the computer must not only recognize that there is a car in the picture , but also know that the car is yellow ; it has to know what &apos; yellow &apos; corresponds to in the picture .
this whole process is called picture question answering .
here is another example .
in this example there is a little bear in the picture .
this is Baidu &apos;s intelligent question answering system .
there is a pizza .
so now we have introduced the basics of image recognition .
next , let &apos;s take a look at how these seemingly cool applications are implemented .
the process of computer image recognition goes like this : first we extract the underlying features of the input image .
historically , the underlying feature maps were actually hand @-@ designed , and might include such elements as color histo@@ grams , gradient histo@@ grams , and summarized information about edges and corners in images .
next we identify these features with a classi@@ fier to achieve image recognition .
with the development of technology , we will find that image classification based directly on underlying features is not very effective .
why ?
for example , we want to recognize a person , but the person &apos;s movements and post@@ ures change .
as the person moves , the underlying features we extract no longer give us a stable representation .
so , scientists have invented another method , which performs some middle @-@ level representations upon the underlying features .
this comprises several methods including the spring model , tape model , and pyramid model .
naturally , following this train of thought , we can also perform high @-@ level representations .
this , then , is how deep learning was established .
one of the ideas of deep learning is that we don &apos;t design any features ourselves , but let the computer carry out end @-@ to @-@ end learning .
all the features and representations from beginning to end , including the process of subsequent classification , are all learned by the computer itself , instead of being designed by humans .
the process of deep learning as applied to pictures is called conv@@ olu@@ tional neural networks .
the input to the conv@@ olu@@ tional neural network is a picture .
the conv@@ olu@@ tional neural network consists of a number of conv@@ olu@@ tional layers , each of which processes the input image and then obtains a structure similar to the image , which is called an output layer .
the output layer of the previous conv@@ olution is input to the input layer of the next conv@@ olution .
with this layer @-@ to @-@ layer processing , we can extract more and more advanced feature representations from the image .
finally , feeding this feature representation into the classi@@ fier , we obtain the result we want for the input image , which may be a classification result , or a question answering result .
here we can see that one difference between deep learning and the traditional method is that the former is extremely reliant on data support .
from the earliest stages of Cal@@ tech 101 , it actually contained one hundred and one categories , thousands of pictures .
later , it gradually developed into the SC@@ EN@@ E@@ 15 data set , then to Cal@@ tech@@ 25@@ 6 , then later to S@@ UN and then finally to Imag@@ e@@ Net .
gradually , the volume of data increased from a few thousand items to several million , and data categories from around 100 to more than a thousand .
Baidu has a huge database with hundreds of millions of images and tens of millions of categories .
this vast amount of data supports the Baidu Brain , resulting in computing performance that sur@@ passes that of any other similar technology .
in addition to our data , we also have an extremely strong network structure .
in 1998 , the deep learning method of the time was called Le@@ Net , which was a very superficial conv@@ olu@@ tional neural network used to recognize hand@@ written fon@@ ts .
2012 saw the invention of a structure called Alex@@ Net , which was able to successfully process millions of images in thousands of categories and achieved the best image classification results in the world at the time .
as this technology has continued to develop , we have reached the point where we can now implement a very deep conv@@ olu@@ tional neural network consisting of five hundred , or even a thousand layers , delivering image classification results that far surpass the networks of 2012 .
next , let &apos;s consider the applications of deep learning in actual products from Baidu ID@@ L .
first , we can see that Baidu is the first company in the world to invent a semantic @-@ based image retrieval and word @-@ guessing system .
in the so @-@ called retrieval and guessing system , when the user enters an image instead of text , the system can not only return a similar picture that is very close to the semantics of the original picture , but also tell the user what category the picture belongs to .
for example , we can tell the user that the input image is a plant , and further a pe@@ ony flower .
in addition , ID@@ L boasts the best pornography recognition system in the world .
we know that there are a lot of this type of pictures on the web , some of which have been uploaded by users and may be prohibited or illegal .
our system can intellig@@ ently recognize with very high speed and high accuracy , whether a picture is normal or is porno@@ graphic or sexy , and then exclude inappropriate images from the Internet .
in addition , we have comprehensively applied our image technology to the Phoenix N@@ est system .
in other words , we can intellig@@ ently tap the preference of an Internet user .
when a user searches for something , what kind of picture do they want ?
we can then show the user a relevant picture , which may make them more inclined to click on it , and subsequently purchase the products linked to the picture .
we have already covered a lot of basic image knowledge , as well as deep learning in changing image technology and the applications of deep learning technology in Baidu products .
but in fact , deep learning technology still has a lot of deficiencies .
for example , in this picture on the screen , when we human beings see it , we may ask ourselves &apos; what is it ? &apos;
are there some people standing there ?
or what is their positi@@ onal relationship ?
and a computer can only go this far .
so , what exactly is going on in the picture ?
in fact , once we &apos;ve observed the picture clearly , we can see that it shows the last US President Barack Obama joking with his staff .
so what the picture really intends to convey is a sense of humor .
although our current computer system can detect people and recognize what this scene is , it cannot understand the deeper meaning that the picture really intends to convey .
this is the direction towards which we will continue to work hard in the future .
thank you everybody !
welcome to the advanced course on our UN@@ IT dialogue system .
I am Jiang Wen@@ bin , a R &amp; D engineer for Baidu UN@@ IT platform .
in this lesson , I will introduce the basic principles and technology behind the dialogue system .
during this class we &apos;ll first take a general look at the function of dialogue understanding and consider the methods commonly used .
we &apos;ll then consider two classic methods of dialogue understanding .
one based on semantic par@@ sing , and the other based on semantic matching .
dialogue understanding through semantic par@@ sing can be further divided into two methods : one based on rule templates and the other based on machine learning .
first , let &apos;s take a look at the overall structure of the dialogue system .
what is the function of the dialogue system ?
it can be summed up in three steps : understanding users &apos; natural language requests .
executing the corresponding instructions .
and giving a response when required .
this block diagram illustrates the basic work flow of the dialogue system .
first the input query goes through the dialogue understanding and dialogue management processes .
then a decision is made to generate language and execute instructions , before finally a response is given .
there are two core modules here .
dialogue understanding and dialogue management .
today &apos;s class focuses on one of the key techniques .
dialogue understanding .
let &apos;s start with a typical example of a human @-@ machine dialogue system .
here is a scenario that shows the interaction with a navig@@ ai@@ on app through speech recognition .
&quot; U &quot; represents the user and &quot; B &quot; represents the robot .
the user asks the robot about the distance to a certain place and how to get there .
what does the robot need to do in order to understand and meet the needs of the user ?
let &apos;s take a look at each turn of this dialog .
first up , the user asks : &quot; how far is Tsinghua University ? &quot;
the robot responds by asking : &quot; where is the starting location ? &quot;
the robot needs to understand that the user is asking about the distance to Tsinghua University .
and it knows that the user has not provided the starting location , so it has to ask the user .
in the second turn of dialogue , the user replies : &quot; Baidu Building . &quot;
the robot responds with : &quot; about six kilometers . &quot;
the robot needs to understand that the user has provided the starting location .
and it can then execute the instruction asking for the distance between these two places , before finally returning the result to the user .
in the third turn , the user en@@ qui@@ res : &quot; how can I get there ? &quot;
the robot responds by asking the user : &quot; using public transport or driving yourself ? &quot;
the robot needs to understand that the user is asking about how to get from the starting location to the destination .
but the user has not specified the method of transport , so the robot has to ask the user .
in the last turn , the user replies : &quot; by public transport . &quot;
the robot responds : &quot; take Metro Line 13 from Xi &apos;@@ er@@ qi to W@@ ud@@ a@@ ok@@ ou . &quot;
in this turn , the robot needs to understand that the user has provided the method of transport , but also that all the information required has now been provided .
therefore the navigation query instruction can now be executed .
after executing the navigation query instruction , the robot returns the result of the query to the user .
we can see that for each turn of dialogue , the robot first needs to understand the key information in the user &apos;s request , including the user &apos;s intent and information related to that intent .
with this in mind , today we are going to discuss understanding the user &apos;s intent and information related to that intent , a process which we will call &apos; dialogue understanding &apos; .
what is the function of dialogue understanding ?
we can define it as follows .
to understand all of the semantic information related to information queries or instruction executions contained in the user request .
dialogue understanding is the foundation of natural language processing .
this means that the ambiguity in natural language processing is the first challenge the dialogue understanding faces .
for example , if you ask the question &quot; How do I get to Tsinghua , &quot; there are two possible replies .
the first would tell you where you should set off from and the second would tell you : &apos; by studying hard . &apos;
OK , so this example is a joke .
the second challenge dialogue understanding faces is the diverse ways in which we can express the same basic request .
using the same example , we could ask the question in many different ways , such as .
&quot; how do I get to Tsinghua ? &quot;
&quot; tell me the way to Tsinghua ? &quot;
or just &quot; Navi@@ gate to Tsinghua . &quot;
the third challenge dialogue understanding faces is collo@@ qu@@ ial speech .
for example , you can ask the same question in a very collo@@ qu@@ ial way , &quot; How to get to Tsinghua ? &quot;
next , we will introduce the common methods used in speech understanding .
there are two classic ways to understand the semantic information in a dialogue .
the first is based on semantic par@@ sing , and the second is based on semantic matching .
the image on the left depicts the semantic par@@ sing approach .
a query can be par@@ sed and transformed into a particular logical structure , such as a syntax tree , or into a table with a fixed format .
the image on the right shows a semantic matching model .
with semantic matching , multiple samples that are sem@@ an@@ tically similar to the query can be retrieved .
and the sample that is the closest is taken as the result of the semantic par@@ sing .
more specifically , dialogue understanding typically includes the following three techniques .
the first is dialogue understanding through semantic par@@ sing based on rule templates .
the second is dialogue understanding through semantic par@@ sing based on machine learning .
the third is dialogue understanding through semantic matching based on machine learning .
let &apos;s start by looking at dialogue understanding through semantic par@@ sing based on rule templates .
the semantic par@@ sing based on rule templates requires semantic schema and rule templates to be manually defined in order to par@@ se the user &apos;s query .
what is a semantic schema ?
as the term suggests , it is the schema of semantic representation .
the most typical semantic schema is the &quot; intent @-@ slot &quot; schema .
in this schema , the semantic information in a sentence is composed of int@@ ents and slots .
what is the &apos; intent &apos; ?
it is the essential intent behind the query sentence .
the &apos; slot &apos; is the key information related to the intent .
the image on the right shows an example of this semantic schema in a navigation scenario .
there are two possible int@@ ents in the scenario .
a query or navigation .
of course , in reality there may be more int@@ ents , but let &apos;s keep it simple here .
these two int@@ ents contain three possible key items of data .
the starting location , the destination , and the method of transport .
a rule template is a manually defined template for matching data .
it contains slots and keywords in an ordered sequence that enables par@@ sing of user queries by means of matching .
the image on the right gives some example templates in the navigation scenario .
for example , the &quot; how do you get from X to Y &quot; template can match with queries similar to it , such as &quot; how do you get from Baidu to Tsinghua . &quot;
in this way , query matching can help us achieve dialogue understanding .
next , let &apos;s take a look at the par@@ sing process for dialogue understanding based on rule templates .
put simply , it is using the template matching process to obtain potential candidates for the par@@ sing result .
and then selecting the one with the highest level of confidence .
the following explains the overall par@@ sing process .
enter the query &quot; how far is it from Baidu to Tsinghua &quot; and use the template matching process to obtain all possible candidate par@@ sing results .
follow the process for candidate confidence evaluation in order to select the candidate with the highest confidence level as the final result .
let &apos;s take a quick look at the concept of confidence level .
confidence level is a measure of the credibility of the match between the current template and the input query .
it can be implemented in many ways .
the simplest and the most effective way is to calculate the extent of the coverage provided by the rules and templates .
in other words , what is the number of matching components as a proportion of the total number of components .
in this example , the template is &quot; how do you get from X to Y &quot; and the query is &quot; how far is it from Baidu to Tsinghua . &quot;
among the five fragments , 3 are matched , so the matching rate is 0.6 , which means the confidence level is 0.6 .
what we have been discussing is par@@ sing based on common templates .
it is clear that the matching process has to follow the relational order of the template components , and this places certain limits on the flexibility of this method .
since the syntax of a user &apos;s query can be flexible and versatile in structure .
we would have to list all possible forms of the template in order to par@@ se the various ways of expressing the query .
this makes for a heavy workload and is relatively inefficient .
so now we &apos;ll consider a high @-@ level form of template , the un@@ ordered template .
un@@ ordered templates cope with the flexibility of language through flexibility in the position of slots and keywords .
in an un@@ ordered template , there is no need to follow a fixed order for slots and keywords , and the matching between templates and inputs is not strictly in a fixed order .
thanks to the specific position constraint information , in an un@@ ordered template it can be flexibly determined whether the components contain a sequence , what that sequence is , and whether each component is necessary .
in this way , a single un@@ ordered template can perform the functions of a number of common templates .
the matching process that is used in un@@ ordered templates is very similar to that used with common templates .
the input query goes through the template matching and confidence evaluation processes .
an example is given in the image below .
on the left we can see four different formul@@ ations of a query , which are then mapped to the same result following par@@ sing with an un@@ ordered template .
we can also see that un@@ ordered rule templates are highly efficient , which is why we use them on our UN@@ IT platform .
now let &apos;s take a look at how developers use rule templates in the dialogue system .
unit is a powerful platform that provides developers with a highly efficient rule template inference engine and a very easy @-@ to @-@ use rule template definition mechanism .
developers only need to define the semantic schem@@ as and annot@@ ate the dialogue templates .
dialogue understanding based on rule templates is efficient to the extent that developers can achieve an average dialogue understanding accuracy of 80 % to 90 % with only a few dozen templates .
now let &apos;s take a look at the dialogue understanding through semantic par@@ sing based on machine learning .
dialogue understanding through semantic par@@ sing based on machine learning par@@ ses the input query in one of two ways .
by converting problems into sequence anno@@ tations or by classi@@ fying problems .
in general , we take the classification approach for intent recognition , and the anno@@ tation approach for slot recognition .
for intent recognition , the intent judgement of queries is modeled as the classification problem .
classification algorithms available for this purpose include the maximum entropy algorithm , the support vector machine model and the neural network model , among others .
for slot recognition , we use a model that is based on anno@@ tation of the word sequence .
the sequence anno@@ tation algorithms available for this include the conditional random field model , the hidden Mar@@ kov model and the neural network model .
dialogue understanding through semantic par@@ sing based on machine learning can be illustrated by the following flow chart .
an input query is first converted to a feature representation , before intent classification and slot recognition are performed respectively on the basis of this representation .
intent recognition is conducted by way of classification , and slot recognition by way of sequence anno@@ tation .
finally an understanding of the entire query sentence is obtained .
what we have discussed so far are some general principles of dialogue understanding through semantic par@@ sing based on machine learning .
here we introduce two more advanced solution strategies .
dialogue understanding based on machine learning has several distinguishing features .
first , the machine learning method requires a large training corpus in order to conduct parameter training .
if the corpus is insufficient , it is probably no better than the method based on rule templates .
second , performance of the machine learning method will be expected to improve if used in conjunction with multiple @-@ task modeling .
there are two advanced semantic understanding models corresponding to the above two features .
the first is the fusion rule and statistical model .
this combines rule templates and machine learning to improve dialogue understanding .
and achieves higher dialogue understanding accuracy in cases where there is less annot@@ ated data available .
the second is joint modeling .
this adopts a model based on the deep neural network .
and realizes intent recognition and slot recognition simultaneously , achieving higher dialogue understanding accuracy with the same amount of data .
now let &apos;s take a look at how developers use dialogue understanding capabilities that are based on machine learning .
the UN@@ IT platform provides developers with a high @-@ performance machine learning model and an efficient sample recommendation and feedback expansion mechanism .
all developers need to do is to define the semantic schema and annot@@ ate a fixed number of dialogue samples .
the accuracy of dialogue understanding can be improved by annot@@ ating more dialogue samples .
now let &apos;s take a look at dialogue understanding based on semantic matching .
dialogue understanding based on semantic matching involves calculating semantic similarity to determine the closest match .
and then using this closest match to understand the input query .
there are two important concepts here .
semantic representation and similarity calculation .
semantic representation means representing the query in a semantic form that is easy to match .
semantic forms that are frequently used include the vector space model , the bag of words model , and the compressed representation of deep learning .
similarity calculation is used to calculate the semantic similarity between the query input and the instances in the instance library .
semantic similarity representation methods that are frequently used include Car@@ tes@@ ian distance and the vector cos@@ ine angle .
dialogue understanding based on semantic matching can be illustrated in the following flow chart .
an example is given below .
the input query &quot; how far is it from Baidu to Tsinghua University &quot; is converted into a specific form of semantic expression through a process of semantic representation .
following a similarity calculation , the result of the query is obtained by retri@@ eving the most similar instance from the instance library .
here we will take a closer look at the compiling of the semantic matching Q &amp; A library .
the building of the semantic matching Q &amp; A library consists of two major steps .
the first is data selection and anno@@ tation .
and the second is data ind@@ exing and storage .
the general workflow for compiling the semantic matching Q &amp; A library is shown in the flow chart on the right .
first , we collect log data from real application scenarios .
then we can produce statistics related to questions and types that are based on the log data .
and filter the samples according to the statistical results .
then we carry out manual or machine @-@ assisted data processing and anno@@ tation .
the final step is ind@@ exing and library storage .
there are two principles for data selection .
the first is that each sample should be representative and should be a frequently @-@ asked question .
the second is that the coverage level of the entire sample set should be sufficiently wide .
this relates to the question of data standards .
now let &apos;s take a look at how developers use semantic matching in dialogue understanding .
the UN@@ IT platform provides developers with high @-@ performance semantic representation and matching models , as well as efficient sample storage and semantic calculation mechanisms .
by simply defining the semantic schema and annot@@ ating a small number of dialogue samples , developers can make use of the platform &apos;s dialogue understanding capability based on semantic matching .
in general , it takes only tens to hundreds of annot@@ ated samples to achieve an average dialogue understanding accuracy of more than 90 % .
OK , so that concludes our lesson for today .
thank you !
hello , everyone !
I &apos;m a R &amp; D engineer for Baidu UN@@ IT platform .
welcome to our advanced course for dialogue system .
today , I will talk about how to integrate a dialogue system into the UN@@ IT platform .
this course involves five sections .
in the first section , I will review the elementary course for system integration .
in the second and third sections , I will analyze the initi@@ ator and respon@@ der in a dialogue from the perspective of engineering architecture .
in the fourth section , I will talk about how developers manage multiple tenants after building a dialogue management system on the UN@@ IT platform .
finally , I will talk about more solutions for system integration .
in the elementary course , we presented a simple script .
this script passed the authentication of Baidu &apos;s AI open platform , integrated with the dialogue interface on the UN@@ IT platform , and a multi @-@ turn dialogue .
the dialogue process is shown in the following figure .
through the two turns of dialogue , the bot can recognize that the user &apos;s intent is to switch the channel to CC@@ TV@@ 1 .
you can find a complete introduction to this example in the elementary course .
now , let &apos;s analyze the process .
who is the respon@@ der in the dialogue ?
when we recorded the elementary course , a BO@@ T responded to the request for a dialogue .
in the recent upgrade , we replaced the term &quot; BO@@ T &quot; with &quot; skill , &quot; and would always use &quot; skill &quot; in the future .
for transition , you can think &quot; skills &quot; as &quot; BO@@ T &quot; used before .
in addition to S@@ kill , we will release bot service response dialogues .
on the UN@@ IT platform , skills are the smallest unit of each effective training .
a bot is usually a set of skills , and can be configured with multiple skills and more dialogue policies .
skills will be available respectively in stores , developers &apos; and bo@@ ts &apos; skill lists .
in stores , we can enjoy skills only on web pages , but cannot invoke them by AP@@ Is .
developers can &quot; purchase &quot; skills from stores .
please pay attention to the quotation marks .
then developers can add them to their skill lists .
developers can create bo@@ ts to register and generate a bot service at the appropriate architecture .
they can configure the bot service with the skills in the skill list , and invoke the service through API .
they can also invoke the skills directly through API .
generally , products are researched and developed after full technical investigation before they are released to online users .
so we set up two environments to ensure that developers launch improved bo@@ ts and skills for dialogues .
the sand@@ box environment is used for model training and performance test .
it is usually deployed for single instance .
the model trained in the sand@@ box environment can be released to the production environment .
when being released , bot services occupy fewer resources , and will be deployed directly in three areas .
skills occupy more resources , and the machine costs are mainly from skills deployment .
so developers can configure the areas for deployment by themselves .
moreover , the bo@@ ts in the production environment can invoke the skills only for the production environment .
on the UN@@ IT platform , a mechanism is established for developers to manage their dialogue performance .
for a skill , the ID is unique for the dialogue performance at any time , and can be used to reproduce the dialogue performance .
for each training , the model will be updated , and a new model ID will be created for each update .
as shown in the figure on the right , a model ID includes the user @-@ defined data version , dialogue operator version , and basic data version .
similarly , there will be a version for bo@@ ts . robot versions include related skill versions and bot configurations .
in general , the user &apos;s objective for dialogues is a model or a set of models .
and the dialogue performances are mapped to a new ID or a set of new ID@@ s every time they change .
that &apos;s all for the respon@@ der in a dialogue .
next , let &apos;s analyze the initi@@ ator in a dialogue from the perspective of engineering architecture .
on the Baidu &apos;s AI open platform , authentication is based on O@@ Au@@ th 2.0 .
a group of A@@ K / SK matches a developer account , which may be allocated with multiple groups of A@@ K / SK .
we can store A@@ K / SK directly on the client devices .
however , this causes severe security risks , and applies only to demo presentation .
if UN@@ IT dialogue services must be accessed directly on a mobile device , the integr@@ at@@ ei@@ on architecture in the second solution is recommended .
the developer &apos;s server and mobile device will establish a &quot; login &quot; relationship , which can be a self @-@ built login mechanism or from a third party .
the developer &apos;s server stores A@@ K / SK , and communic@@ ates with Baidu &apos;s AI open platform to obtain access _ token .
an access _ token can be applied from a mobile device to the developer &apos;s server , or pushed from the developer &apos;s server to a mobile device .
it is recommended to manage the access _ token in the period of validity .
after the UN@@ IT platform understands the intent , slot , action and so on , developers must develop certain logic to interact for the final dialogue .
this logic may require access to other services .
on the UN@@ IT platform , we call this process as an introduction of dialogue resources , such as quer@@ ying weather , and work order status , etc .
on the UN@@ IT platform , the built @-@ in dialogue resources will reuse the integration process of open AP@@ Is .
generally , authentication mechanisms are required by third @-@ party dialogue resources .
now , let &apos;s take O@@ Au@@ th 2.0 as an example .
developers need to release access _ token to appropriate devices .
according to the previous section , we can consider the UN@@ IT public cloud as a kind of &quot; mobile device . &quot;
section 4 , how does our platform support developers to achieve multi @-@ tenancy ?
some of you may be unfamiliar with &quot; multi @-@ tenant , &quot; a design concept that should be widely used in our system .
for details of the concept , please see the description on the right .
I will not present it in detail .
on the UN@@ IT platform , how can a developer achieve a multi @-@ tenant system ?
first , build a multi @-@ account management system .
second , fully use tags for data isolation .
firstly , developers can build their account mapping .
for our UN@@ IT platform , a developer system corresponds to one developer accoun@@ t.@@ Multi @-@ account management is for the business relationship between the developer system and the developer @-@ customer system .
for the UN@@ IT platform , a developer system corresponds only to one developer account .
secondly , we can fully use tags .
the dialogue intent and Q &amp; A intent of the UN@@ IT platform support tag attributes .
the logic of intent label and dialogue are as follows .
an intent can have multiple attributes , and a conversation request can have multiple tag parameters .
tag parameters and attributes match through the &quot; OR &quot; logic - business logic that needs &quot; AND &quot; can also be converted into &quot; OR &quot; to be successfully implemented .
as shown in the figure on the right , based on a UN@@ IT bot service , multiple &quot; small bo@@ ts &quot; can be built .
next , we will come to the last section of this chapter to introduce more solutions for integration .
after ordinary developers log into our UN@@ IT platform , they will see our main architecture .
for developers closely working with us or in need of high custom@@ ization , we will provide the private domain cloud architecture .
its function is based on a version of our major frame , which may have been customized .
for deployment , there is also an independent solution .
the computing resources and stability of the system will not be affected by other developers .
for the offline embedded architecture , the UN@@ IT dialogue capability is deployed on the embedded devices as a solution .
because of the limited computing resources of the terminal equipment , in order to ensure the performance and responsiveness requirements at the product level , the performance will be reduced to a certain extent .
in the future , there will also be solutions for online / offline integration .
and integrated private cloud architecture in this area , which package all of our UN@@ IT capabilities into one or a set of mirrors .
for doc@@ ker images or virtual machine images with the authorization that we need to deliver , we will provide mirror @-@ level SL@@ As .
in this area , clustered deployment solutions of private cloud will be derived in the future .
the cluster solution reduces machine costs mainly through optimizing deployment - our UN@@ IT platforms will provide more advice on cluster solution at that time .
for our new UN@@ IT products , we will create a separate process , turn the leading dialogue technology into products .
and discuss with developers about the trend of dialogue technologies .
that &apos;s all for today .
thank you !
hello , everyone .
welcome to our advanced course on the UN@@ IT dialogue system .
I &apos;m Ji You@@ sheng , an R &amp; D engineer for Baidu UN@@ IT platform .
in this course , we &apos;ll learn how to use the UN@@ IT platform together with the DM Kit offline dialogue management framework to configure a dialogue system .
as you know , UN@@ IT gives developers access to Baidu &apos;s experience in natural language understanding and interaction technology , which it has accumulated over many years .
this lowers the threshold for developing dialogue systems .
using the UN@@ IT platform , developers can easily configure dialogue understanding capability and simple dialogue responses .
to handle complex dialogue logic , the UN@@ IT platform also offers the open @-@ source DM Kit offline dialogue management framework . this connects seam@@ lessly with UN@@ IT &apos;s dialogue understanding capability on the cloud , supporting multi @-@ state complex dialogue process control .
developing a dialogue system using the UN@@ IT cloud and the DM Kit involves four steps .
the first step is to define the skills and design the dialogue process as well as the int@@ ents and slots we need .
this is the foundation for building a dialogue system .
sound skill definition and design will ensure an effective and high quality dialogue system .
after defining the int@@ ents required for the skill , the second step is to configure the dialogue understanding capability of the skill on the UN@@ IT cloud .
this allows the dialogue system to understand natural language input and convert the input into dialogue int@@ ents and slots , which are then fed into the dialogue management module for subsequent processing .
the third step is to use the DM Kit to implement dialogue management .
in the DM Kit , a dialogue process is managed by policy configurations .
we have dedicated chapters to follow that to introduce policy syntax and DM Kit framework design .
for now , let &apos;s think of a policy as a description language for the DM Kit to define the dialogue process .
in addition , configurations written in this language can be edited through graphical views .
therefore , in this step , I will show how to use graphical editing to achieve dialogue management function of DM Kit .
the final step is to run the DM Kit and allow it to connect with the dialogue understanding service on UN@@ IT cloud .
at this point , we have established a complete dialogue system that we can interact with .
next , I will show you how to use the UN@@ IT platform and the DM Kit to build a dialogue system , taking the dialogue skill of booking a hotel as an example .
the first step is to define the skill .
the dialogue process of hotel booking can be simplified into a flow chart like this .
the dialogue begins and the user requests to book a hotel .
the system checks whether the booking information provided by the user is complete .
the information required for booking usually includes the time of stay , room type , and desired hotel .
based on the user &apos;s location , the system searches for hotels and provides a list of candidate hotels for the user to select from .
if some information is missing , the system can ask the user to clarify and fill them into the slots .
once the booking information is complete , the system asks the user to confirm the booking .
if the user confirms the booking , the system books the hotel and the dialogue termin@@ ates .
if the user canc@@ els the booking or submits a new request , the dialogue re @-@ enters the &quot; hotel booking request &quot; state .
to sum up , the dialogue contains three int@@ ents : the hotel booking intent , the affirmative intent , and the negative intent .
the hotel booking intent has four slots : the time of stay , room type , hotel , and location .
in real dialogue applications , the time of stay and room type can be set as mandatory slots to be filled using the slot clarification mechanism on UN@@ IT cloud .
the hotel and location can be set as optional slots , with the DM Kit used to control the dialogue process .
if neither the hotel nor the location slots are filled , the system asks the user which hotel or where he would like to stay .
if the user provides only the location , the system searches for candidate hotels based on the location and delivers the results for the user to make a decision .
if the user confirms a hotel selection , then the booking can be executed .
once the skill has been defined , we can use the UN@@ IT platform to create the skill and configure the dialogue understanding capability .
first , we need to create the skill .
let &apos;s create a skill named book _ hotel .
since we are using the DM Kit to manage the dialogue , we need to select the option of Using DM Kit configurations in the Dialogue Response Set@@ tings during skill configuration .
next , we can create dialogue int@@ ents .
the int@@ ents we create here should correspond to the three int@@ ents that we identified when defining the skill .
these are : intent _ BO@@ OK _ HO@@ T@@ EL , INT@@ ENT _ NO , and INT@@ ENT _ Y@@ ES .
the intent INT@@ ENT _ BO@@ OK _ HO@@ T@@ EL must be associated with four slots : user _ time , user _ room _ type , user _ hotel , and user _ location .
for the user _ time slot , we can reuse the value list of the system _ time slot .
the user _ room _ type slot is a custom one , and room type information such as standard room , king @-@ size room , and double room must be imported .
we reuse the value list of the system _ location _ hotel slot for the user _ hotel slot , and that of the system _ location slot for the user _ location slot .
intent _ NO and INT@@ ENT _ Y@@ ES do not need to be associated with any slot .
the third step is to configure training data .
once we have created the dialogue int@@ ents , we can then configure a dialogue template to par@@ se natural language into int@@ ents and slots so as to implement the skill &apos;s understanding capability .
as a cold start , we create a dialogue template for each intent .
both INT@@ ENT _ Y@@ ES and INT@@ ENT _ NO correspond to a template that contains only one keyword representing affirmation or neg@@ ation respectively .
the template for INT@@ ENT _ BO@@ OK _ HO@@ T@@ EL contains the keywords &apos; booking &apos; and &apos; hotel &apos; as well as the four slots associated with this intent .
keywords and templates are created on the same page .
it is important to collect a wide variety of different vocabulary that could be encountered .
the fourth step is to train the skill .
after creating and config@@ uring the skill , we can train the skill and validate a new model on the platform .
we can then use the test dialog boxes on the platform to check whether the dialogue int@@ ents are being correctly understood .
if the int@@ ents are correctly understood , then the dialogue understanding has been successfully implemented on the UN@@ IT platform .
next , we need to configure the dialogue process using the DM Kit .
the DM Kit is an open @-@ source offline dialogue management framework .
we need download it to the developer server and configure it before we compile and run it .
let &apos;s look at how we can download and compile the DM Kit .
the codes for the DM Kit are hosted on G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b , so we will need to download the codes to the developer machine by running the g@@ it clone command .
once the codes have been downloaded , we can enter the directory where the UN@@ IT @-@ DM Kit codes are located .
run the D@@ EP@@ s shell script to download and install br@@ p@@ c and any other necessary software .
enter related parameters in the D@@ EP@@ s script to specify the system environment of the development machine .
for example , if codes are to be compiled in M@@ AC OS , enter the parameter ma@@ c .
other supported operating systems include U@@ bun@@ tu and Cent@@ OS .
after installing the required depend@@ encies , use the commands below to create a build directory and run the c@@ make and make commands in this directory to compile .
after compiling , the DM Kit program and required configurations generated by the DM Kit are displayed in the build directory .
among them are pre @-@ configured dialogue process configurations including the hotel booking example described in this course .
these configurations are saved in the con@@ f / app / demo directory .
we can view or edit the dialogue process flow chart for the DM Kit by using an open @-@ sourced visual tool .
for example , the flow chart displayed on the right is what we see if we import the XML files for the hotel booking process into draw@@ .@@ io .
during actual configuration development , we can edit the previously defined dialogue process according to certain editing rules in draw@@ .@@ io to produce a dialogue process flow chart which can be recognized by the DM Kit .
there are later chapters that are dedicated to editing rules .
the pre @-@ configured configuration file in the DM Kit source code is provided for reference .
after editing , we can export the flow chart in XML format and save the file for the DM Kit to process .
in the previous dialogue process flow@@ chart , we used the built @-@ in function of the DM Kit to call external services .
in our example the first service is hotel search .
the system searches for candidate hotels based on the location information provided by the user .
secondly , once complete booking information is available , we need call the hotel booking interface to actually book a hotel .
the two services can only be called after their URL addresses are registered in the remote _ servic@@ es.@@ j@@ son configuration file .
the configuration example we provide here is for reference only and you would need to configure the actual addresses according to which products are being used .
so now we have compiled the dialogue process and exported the file in XML format .
we will now place the XML file in the unit @-@ d@@ m@@ kit / con@@ f / app / demo directory , and then run the run@@ .@@ py script under the unit @-@ d@@ m@@ kit / language _ compiler directory .
the run@@ .@@ py script converts the exported XML file into a policy configuration file which the DM Kit can load and run .
after the script is executed , a j@@ son file is generated in the directory where the XML file is located .
the j@@ son file is the policy configuration file .
finally , we register the path of the j@@ son file and its UN@@ IT skill ID in the DM Kit &apos;s registration file produc@@ ts.@@ j@@ son .
at the same time , we can host the skill &apos;s ap@@ i _ key and secret _ key in the DM Kit .
in this way , we are not required to specify an access _ token when submitting a request to the DM Kit .
after config@@ uring the DM Kit dialogue process , we re @-@ compile and run the DM Kit .
now , we can test the dialogue process by requesting service interfaces from the DM Kit .
the DM Kit code library provides scripts , which can be used to test dialogue processes .
after the developer runs the script and simul@@ ates user input texts for interaction , we can book a hotel .
so now we have built a dialogue system that can be used to book a hotel .
however , the system is still relatively simple .
in actual applications , after rolling out the dialogue system , we will need to collect dialogue logs from the online system to conduct deep analysis and knowledge extraction .
we can use this to produce new training data that will help to optimize dialogue performance .
in this way , the dialogue system can continuously learn and become smarter .
OK , that &apos;s all for this class .
thank you .
hello everyone !
welcome to the advanced course on the UN@@ IT dialogue system .
I am Sun Shu@@ qi , an R &amp; D engineer for UN@@ IT .
in this lesson , I wi@@ l introduce to you how to collect data .
there are two types of data that need to be collected , namely , slot data and sample utter@@ ances .
in this scenario of hotel booking , the slot data that need to be collected include city names , hotel names , time , numbers , room types , bed types , room facilities , and so on .
the sample utter@@ ances that need to be collected are some common utter@@ ances regarding reservation , cancellation , and change of booking .
here is how to collect the two types of data efficiently .
the first is slot data .
for slot data , we recommend you to reuse the system pres@@ et slot value lists as much as possible .
for example , in the scenario of hotel booking , the system slot value list has a high coverage of city names , time , numbers as well as some hotel names .
of course , in any scenario , there will be some custom data that cannot be covered in the system slot value lists .
for example , some special hotel names are not covered in the system slot value list , nor are the concepts unique to the hotel industry , such as room types , bed types , etc .
in such cases , we need to supplement it with a custom dictionary and some rules .
when using custom dictionary and rules , we need to pay attention to certain things .
first , the priority of the custom slot value lists and rules are higher than that of the system built @-@ in slot value lists .
that is to say , if a word is identified as a custom slot and a system slot at the same time , we will present the result as the identified custom slot .
of course , there is an exception here .
if an inclusion relationship exists between the system slot value list and the custom slot value list , the word will be identified as the system slot .
for example , &quot; three hours &quot; will be identified as the system slot sy@@ s _ time _ unit .
although it contains a word in the user &apos;s custom list , for example &quot; hour , &quot; it will still be identified as the system slot because &quot; three hours &quot; covers the word &quot; hour . &quot;
second , what if a word appears in multiple custom slot value lists ?
the slot that matches the dialogue template will be accepted .
for example , the word &quot; Baidu Campus &quot; is defined in the value lists of the slot departure and destination .
when we see a query like &quot; navigate to Baidu Campus , &quot; how will the term &quot; Baidu Campus &quot; be identified ?
in this case , the dialogue template will be referenced .
the template that this query matches is &quot; navigate to user _ to , &quot; and the in@@ ferred intent is RO@@ UT@@ E .
as such , Baidu Campus in this query will be interpreted as user _ to for the intent of RO@@ UT@@ E .
OK , next , let &apos;s look at the collection of sample utter@@ ances .
the sample utter@@ ance to be collected include two types , with the first type being the task @-@ oriented sample utter@@ ance .
taking the scenario of hotel reservation as an example , we need to collect users &apos; actual wor@@ dings for room booking as much as possible .
the second type is Q &amp; A pairs .
we should create different categories for Q &amp; A pairs , and then collect a few frequently @-@ asked questions and their standard answers for each category , before uplo@@ ading them to the UN@@ IT system .
unit provides a recommendation function for sample utter@@ ances to help developers quickly obtain sample utter@@ ances .
this function is based on Baidu &apos;s big data , which can expand the samples provided by developers by ten to a hundred times .
the prerequisite of using this function is that developers need to collect at least 50 sample utter@@ ances to serve as the starting set .
based on the starting set , two methods of sample recommendation and expansion are available .
the first is based on random walk while the second is based on syn@@ onym replacement .
the recommendations based on random walk are offered based on the bi@@ graph of the relationship between Baidu &apos;s huge library of queries and clicks of documents .
for example , if the developer provides a sample utter@@ ance of &quot; b@@ raised pork instructions , &quot; then through the bi@@ graph , we will find that the same documents get clicked on for the queries of &quot; how to make b@@ raised pork &quot; and &quot; b@@ raised pork recipe , &quot; and so we can infer that the latter two samples may be describing the same or similar things as the initial sample .
based on this approach , we can add the latter two samples to the sample set .
by using such a method of sample recommendation and expansion , the sample set provided by the developer can be expanded by about ten times initially .
of course , these samples may not be entirely accurate , so we need to manually screen the samples obtained .
based on the relatively more accurate samples obtained via manual screening , we can continue to expand the sample set many more times .
of course , this sample recommendation method has a limited scope of application .
this method is more suitable for common scenarios in Baidu search .
however , it may not be suitable for uncommon scenarios in Baidu search , such as customer service and ch@@ it @-@ chat scenarios .
please take note of this .
the second sample recommendation method is based on syn@@ onym replacement , and is also very simple .
we can replace a fragment in the sample with a syn@@ onym and thereby obtain a new sample .
in this example , we can replace &quot; instructions &quot; with &quot; how to cook &quot; or &quot; method &quot; and thereby obtain a new sample .
unlike the previous method , this method is more flexible and has no scenario limitations .
but there is a disadvantage .
because syn@@ onym replacement is rather difficult to regulate , it is likely to introduce some noise .
for example , if &quot; instruction &quot; is replaced by &quot; method , &quot; we will get a less coherent query sample in &quot; b@@ raised pork method . &quot;
we came up with some statistics for this .
at only about 15 % , the percentage of coherent samples obtained is somewhat low .
therefore , strict manual screening is required for syn@@ onym @-@ replacement @-@ based sample recommendation to work .
we thus suggest using this method as a catch @-@ all .
OK , that &apos;s all for this lesson .
thank you all !
welcome to the advanced course on the UN@@ IT dialogue system .
I am Jiang Wen@@ bin , an R &amp; D engineer for the Baidu UN@@ IT platform .
in this lesson , I will introduce to you how to define a dialogue system based on UN@@ IT technology .
before introducing the definition method , let me first show you the overall process of building a complete dialogue system .
we can see from this flow chart that the entire building process consists of three stages - design , configuration , and optimization .
the main tasks in the design stage are dialogue system definition and data collection .
the tasks in the configuration stage include knowledge resource labeling and model training .
and the optimization stage mainly consists of the iterative optimization after the system has been put into operation .
this time we will focus on the dialogue system definition in the design stage .
the first step of dialogue system definition is business scenario analysis .
to build a human @-@ machine dialogue system for a specific business scenario , we first need to analyze this business scenario .
I will explain this using hotel reservation as an example .
firstly , we have to clearly identify what should be done and what should not .
these are what should be done , for instance .
firstly we should cover the dialogues for room booking , room cancellation , room change , and room search .
they are task @-@ oriented dialogues .
secondly we s@@ ould provide answers to frequently asked questions about hotel room reservation .
they are Q &amp; A @-@ based dialogues .
thirdly we should have some simple greetings and pleas@@ an@@ tries .
well , what should not be done ?
pure ch@@ it @-@ ch@@ ats are unnecessary in the business scenario of hotel room reservation .
on the three types of dialogues , I will make a brief introduction .
task @-@ oriented dialogues are conducted with specific objectives .
the requests have to be parame@@ ter@@ ized .
for example , from a request like &quot; I want to book a hotel near Beijing Railway Station for tonight , &quot; clear int@@ ents and slots can be extracted .
in this example , the intent is to book a hotel , and there are two slots - the check @-@ in time , which is tonight , and the hotel location , which is near Beijing Railway Station .
Q &amp; A @-@ based dialogues also have objectives .
however , the requests don &apos;t have to be parame@@ ter@@ ized .
for example , a query about cancellation fees and related rules .
ch@@ it @-@ Chat @-@ oriented dialogues don &apos;t have any clear objective .
they are ordinary ch@@ ats which require no attention in this scenario .
the second step of dialogue system definition is business function definition .
business function definition is to define the function points , their priority , and key elements of the business based on the earlier business scenario analysis .
in the business scenario of hotel reservation , the defined function points , in order of priority , are room booking and search , room cancellation , room change , and inquiries on other rules or policies .
the figure on the right shows the analysis of the key elements of each function point , which I will not elaborate on here .
the third step of dialogue system definition is sorting out dialogue logic .
based on the business scenario analysis and business function definition in the previous two steps , as well as our common experiences from everyday conversations , we can sort out the corresponding dialogue logic .
the figure on the left shows a typical dialogue process .
based on all the possible dialogue processes in the business scenario of hotel reservation , we can come up with a definite flow chart of dialogue logic .
shown on the right is the flow chart of dialogue logic summarized for the hotel reservation scenario .
the fourth step of dialogue system definition is semantic schema definition .
based on the earlier analysis and sorting , we can define the semantic schema in a way that UN@@ IT supports .
what does a semantic schema include ?
it includes int@@ ents , slots , and corresponding ways of responding .
for the function point of room reservation , the corresponding intent is to reserve a room , and its slots include check @-@ in time , check @-@ out time , and hotel type .
there are two possible ways of responding .
if some slot information is missing , the user should be prompted for clarification .
once all slots are filled , the command of room reservation can be executed .
alright , in this course , I have briefly introduced how to define a dialogue system .
please stay tuned for more UN@@ IT lessons .
thanks !
hello , everyone !
welcome to our advanced course on the UN@@ IT dialogue system .
I &apos;m Ji You@@ sheng , an R &amp; D engineer for Baidu UN@@ IT platform .
in this lesson , we will introduce the UN@@ IT open @-@ source dialogue management framework , the DM Kit .
first , let &apos;s take a quick look at the overall structure of the dialogue system .
in general , we can divide the task @-@ oriented dialogue system into three modules : the dialogue understanding module , the dialogue management module , and the resource retrieval &amp; task execution module .
for example , a user inputs &quot; help me book a standard room at Home Inn in Shang@@ di , Beijing for today &quot; in the hotel booking dialogue system .
the dialogue understanding module receives the natural language input , processes it , and then outputs the appropriate intent and slots .
the intent here is to book a hotel , and the slots include the hotel name , room type and time of stay .
the intent and slots will later be used as the inputs for the dialogue management module .
the dialogue management module selects actions for execution based on the intent , slots , and the current dialogue state .
so , in our example , based on the intent of booking a hotel and the slots such as hotel name , room type and time of stay , the dialogue management module decides to proceed to execute a booking .
it then selects the &apos; book a hotel &apos; action , and instruc@@ ts the resource retrieval &amp; task execution module to perform the operation .
the resource retrieval &amp; task execution module calls an external service to book the hotel , and sends the result to the user in the form of natural language .
in this way , a dialogue interaction is completed .
so , what is the framework of UN@@ IT corresponding to this dialogue system architecture ?
to simplify , we can divide the framework of UN@@ IT system into two parts , similar to the dialogue system modules we just looked at .
one is the dialogue understanding service on the cloud .
it par@@ ses the natural language input into dialogue int@@ ents and slots .
the other part covers dialogue management , resource retrieval and task execution .
unit offers developers a choice of two methods to realize this part .
the first choice allows developers to achieve simple dialogue responses using the response utter@@ ance configuration on the cloud platform .
the second choice is to use the DM Kit , the offline dialogue management framework , and that is what we will focus on in this lesson .
using the DM Kit , developers can realize more complex dialogue process management and task execution .
later , we will look at the design principles and usage of the DM Kit in more details .
but first , let &apos;s take a look at the abstract dialogue process in the DM Kit .
there are two main concepts about dialogue in the DM Kit , namely dialogue state and policy .
dialogue state &apos; refers to the state of a dialogue between the current user and the system .
the policy can be understood as the most basic unit of dialogue processing logic .
for each turn of dialogue requests , the DM Kit receives a natural language input from a user , acc@@ esses the the dialogue understanding module on the cloud , and then par@@ ses the natural language input into dialogue int@@ ents and slots .
according to the int@@ ents , slots , and current dialogue state , the DM Kit selects the appropriate policy for execution .
for example , if we choose policy A , the DM Kit exec@@ utes the dialogue processing logic described in policy A .
during processing , it may access external services or a knowledge base to get data , and generate utter@@ ances or commands as the final response of the system .
once policy A has been executed , the DM Kit updates the current dialogue state to the state specified in policy A , for example , dialogue state 2 , thereby implementing the change of dialogue state .
next , we will take a closer look at the concept of policy in the DM Kit .
a policy is the most basic unit in the DM Kit to process dialogue logic .
it defines the complete behavior of the skills in a specific dialogue state .
a policy is made up of three parts : triggers , business parameters , and reply contents .
let &apos;s consider these three parts in the context of the hotel booking example .
the first part is the triggers .
this defines the conditions under which a policy is selected .
for example , we can define the trigger of a policy as the intent being hotel booking , slots being hotel name , room type and time of stay , and state being 001 .
while the dialogue system is in the state 001 , a user inputs the sentence &quot; help me book a standard room at Home Inn in Shang@@ di Beijing for today . &quot;
the natural language understanding module par@@ ses the input and obtains the intent of hotel booking and slots of hotel name , room type and time of stay .
then the policy defined with this trigger will be selected for execution .
the second part of a policy concerns business parameters .
it defines the parameters to be used when processing the dialogue logic .
these parameters can be slot values or function results .
developers can define the dialogue processing logic , obtain parameters , access external services , or execute functions to get the data needed for dialogue responses .
in this example , we have defined three variables for the values of the three slots : hotel name , room type and time of stay .
lastly , we have also defined a function as a variable .
this function books a hotel based on the previous three variables , and then as@@ signs the result to this last variable .
the last part of a policy is to define the output .
for each policy , the output consists of three parts .
the first part is condition assertion .
it specifies the conditions to be met for using the current output .
the second part concerns the result of the dialogue response .
it can use the pre @-@ defined business parameters to complete a template which can then generate and return an utter@@ ance .
the third part deals with the state update .
it specifies the system &apos;s new dialogue state after the current policy has been processed .
at the same time it can also store parameters , and provide them for later turns of dialogue .
in our example , we must first determine whether the result of the hotel booking is &apos; 1@@ &apos; , that is , whether the booking is successful .
if yes , we need to return the appropriate utter@@ ance to the user , and then specify that the current dialogue state needs to be updated to 00@@ 3 .
OK , we just talked about how to define a policy .
how does a policy take effect during the running of the DM Kit ?
let &apos;s take a look at the service architecture of the DM Kit .
at the core of the DM Kit is a dialogue management engine .
in this engine , the dialogue process for each skill is defined in a j@@ son file , which includes many policies .
when we run the DM Kit , each request first acc@@ esses the skills configured on the cloud , and obtains the par@@ sing result .
then , the DM Kit finds the appropriate policy in the corresponding j@@ son file according to the skill ID and the par@@ sing result .
we have already introduced that functions can be defined as parameters in a policy .
these functions now need to be defined and implemented in the DM Kit .
the DM Kit has some built @-@ in common functions that are provided as shared functions , including the operation for requesting external services to par@@ se data .
all skills can called directly .
developers can also customize functions and call them to meet their specific business requirements .
next up , we will take a detailed look at the configuration structure and usage of the DM Kit .
the codes for the DM Kit are open @-@ source and are hosted on G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b .
in practice , developers can implement the majority of dialogue process management via configuration .
the configuration files for the DM Kit can be found in the con@@ f directory .
from top to bottom , the first file is bot _ tok@@ ens@@ .@@ j@@ son .
developers can register in this file the ap@@ i key and secret key that correspond to the skill on the cloud .
this means that an access token is not required when making a request to the DM Kit .
the demo directory contains the policy configuration files for our two demo scenarios .
the j@@ son file for each scenario is the policy configuration loaded by the DM Kit .
the x@@ ml files will be introduced later .
the produc@@ ts.@@ j@@ son file is used to register the skills and the appropriate policy configuration files .
for each skill , the skill ID and file path of a policy must be registered in this file to ensure correct loading and execution of the policy .
the remote _ servic@@ es.@@ j@@ son file is used to configure the external service addresses to be accessed by the DM Kit service , including the UN@@ IT &apos;s cloud address and any third @-@ party services &apos; addresses , which must be registered in this file to ensure access is available .
the g@@ flag@@ .@@ con@@ f file is mainly used to configure DM Kit settings such as service port , request path and number of concurrent requests .
generally it &apos;s not necessary to change these settings .
the core of the DM Kit configuration is policy configuration .
each skill needs to be configured with a j@@ son file , which contains a series of policies in an array .
the configuration syntax of each policy element in the array should comply with the specifications defined by the DM Kit .
this mainly involves three parts : trigger conditions , business parameters and output definitions .
here we list the main fields and descriptions .
for more information , you can log in to our official G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b page and refer to the detailed documentation .
developers can implement the dialogue management capability of a skill by configure the policy based on the dialogue logic .
they can also define functions as parameters in order to implement dialogue logic that requires special processing or to access external services .
after editing the policy file for the skill , we need to register it and its skill ID in the configuration file produc@@ ts.@@ j@@ son .
developers can also register the ap@@ i key and secret key of the skill to the file bot _ tok@@ ens .
this means that the DM Kit automatically gets an access token when communicating with the cloud , and the user does not need to upload a token when requesting the DM Kit .
after editing the policy file and registering it , how do we test the performance of the skill ?
first , we need to download the codes for the DM Kit from G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b and compile them .
after compilation , we replace the configuration file in the output directory with the pre @-@ edited file , and then run the DM Kit .
the configuration of the DM Kit is modified with the file g@@ flag in the con@@ f directory , which contains the port and path of the service request .
in general , we use the default configuration .
once the DM Kit is running , we can access the service interface of the DM Kit to test the dialogue .
the interface protocol of the DM Kit is compatible with the dialogue interface protocol of UN@@ IT 2.0 .
developers can access the DM Kit service by assembling the j@@ son data according to the protocol .
we also provide the Py@@ th@@ on script . users can run this script to simulate dialogues with local DM Kit services .
of course , these operations assume that the skills in the UN@@ IT cloud have been trained and can run normally .
now , I will introduce the DM Kit &apos;s visual configuration tool .
we have looked at how to configure a policy so as to manage the dialogue process .
for dialogues with many complex state changes , we can use visual tools to design and edit the dialogue process in the DM kit .
here we use the open @-@ source m@@ x@@ graph as the visual tool following four steps .
step 1 : edit the dialogue process on the draw@@ .@@ io website according to the pre @-@ defined rules .
step 2 : after editing the dialogue process , export the dialogue flow chart in an x@@ ml file , and store it in the configuration directory of the DM Kit .
the x@@ ml file for the demo scenario we saw earlier was edited and exported using this tool .
step 3 : generate the j@@ son configuration file .
the DM Kit provides a conversion script .
developers can run the program run@@ .@@ py in the language _ compl@@ ier directory , which converts the x@@ ml file into a corresponding j@@ son file .
step 4 : after registering the j@@ son file and the corresponding skill ID following the same process as before , we can run the DM Kit to load and execute it .
when editing a dialogue process with a visual tool , we need to follow certain rules .
these rules are very simple , and we have defined several types of com@@ positi@@ onal elements shown below .
the first type are one @-@ way arrow lines .
they connect to other elements , indicating changes of state .
the second type ellip@@ ses .
they indicate user nodes , in which are dialogue int@@ ents and slots .
they correspond to triggers in the policy syntax we mentioned earlier .
the third type are rounded rectang@@ les .
they indicate BO@@ T nodes , where parameters and BO@@ T replies can be defined .
they correspond to the business parameters and outputs in the policy syntax .
the last type are diamonds .
they indicate conditional judgments .
when different conditions are met , access to different output nodes is granted .
in policy syntax , these are the conditions in the definition of output .
using these com@@ positi@@ onal elements , we can edit a complete dialogue flow chart .
for example , this is a complete dialogue flow chart for the hotel booking example we looked at in the previous section .
you can refer to lesson three for the detailed building steps for this example .
OK .
that &apos;s all for this lesson .
thank you all !
how do we display good taste after we die ?
should we be buried in the most luxurious tomb ?
if price indeed corresponds to taste , then we do have a lot of options now .
what if taste is not demonstrated by luxury but instead by an innovative and pioneering spirit ?
in that case , we are favored with an auspicious start .
on tomb @-@ sweeping day , we always see news coverage in magazines that the dead are cont@@ ending with the living for land .
we don &apos;t contend with the living for land .
where should we go ?
this is where we should go .
I believe you are aware of the widespread idea of re@@ claiming land from the sea for farming , or , more broadly , re@@ claiming land for municipal construction .
since it is practical to reclaim land for farming or municipal construction , then why not do so for tombs ?
in this respect , we can be innovative and pioneering .
if you build a cemetery on the sea in the future , then it will surely feel like it is facing the sea , with spring flowers blooming .
to be luxurious or pioneering is not the only desirable way to die with good taste , you could also choose to die having lived a life full of stories .
this is the Paris subway .
it is well known to overseas friends that things displayed in the subway stations of Paris are belongings of people who passed away .
their pre@@ dil@@ ections were different from those of ordinary people .
in ancient times , emper@@ ors were buried deep , so their preferences were kept a mystery .
nevertheless , modern society is different ; no matter how deep you are buried , we can still know your tastes .
we learn them not from museums , but rather from the sub@@ ways beneath them , where we are likely to see all the details .
you may ask if there is any real chance to become one of them ?
of course .
so what should we do ?
to die having lived a life full of stories .
but how ?
let us look at the picture on the left ; it is the Women &apos;s Table at Yale University .
we all know that girls were not admitted into Yale until 1969 , so May@@ a Lin , a famous Chinese @-@ American architect designed this Women &apos;s Table .
it indicates the number of girls admitted from the 19th century until now .
although quite attractive at university , girls are depicted as people with miserable lives , and pretty girls are the cause of much trouble according to more than one writer .
is it not so ?
in their works , charming girls tend to die young , if not cause trouble , yes ?
no matter how miserable they may be , they are still worth a tomb if they unfortunately die young .
I think Japanese literature handles this properly , by always providing such women a desirable destination .
look at this picture , a tomb .
can you imagine how many people are buried inside ?
not one , at any rate , as it is a tomb for scores of women .
it is worthwhile to note that they were all married women , trusted no men and res@@ ented them so violently that they would rather be buried with women than with their men , even though they spent their entire lives together .
so this tomb was built for women who had given up all hope towards men - in other words , for those who died with un@@ qu@@ enc@@ hable hatred .
and this is what having stories means .
if you visit a plain cemetery with lots of couples buried together , I reckon you would have little interest , would you ?
well , when you assume that people are buried in ones and tw@@ os after death , how you would feel if I told you that , no , they are buried in scores in these tombs .
you may say how come ?
was there a massacre ?
absolutely not .
I will then tell you they were scores of women .
in your opinion , they must have been sp@@ inst@@ ers .
wrong again , they did have families .
you cannot wait to ask a third question : why were they not buried with their husbands ?
this is because they totally lost faith in their husbands and refused to be buried together .
this is quite dramatic .
why would such a story become so eye @-@ catching ?
in fact , we can see that lately the funeral industry has been glam@@ or@@ izing stories like this .
and this movie serves as one significant glam@@ or@@ izing factor , right ?
it also won an Oscar .
actually this teaches us a very simple lesson that the living have a lot to learn from the dead .
so this is the meaning it conve@@ ys , right ?
the dead will not be separated from the living for good .
on the contrary , their attitudes towards death shine into our lives , just like a beam of sunlight .
in a sense , this movie is very touching , and it also makes us to realize that death brings cultural meaning .
then does any one of you really understand what kind of cultural meaning this is ?
for those who have been to P@@ ere L@@ ac@@ ha@@ ise C@@ eme@@ tery , do you know why it attracts so many tourists from all over the world every day ?
I must tell you it is because people with stories are buried there .
back in 18th century , however , P@@ ere L@@ ac@@ ha@@ ise C@@ eme@@ tery was a desolate area .
considering few people were willing to visit this cemetery , the administrative team under the mayor of Paris came up with the brilliant idea to turn this bleak cemetery into one with splendid stories .
who did they invite ?
these two were invited , as they were despised by the French people in that era .
this is Peter A@@ bel@@ ard , a the@@ ologi@@ an , and this is Hel@@ o@@ ise .
actually , she was A@@ bel@@ ard &apos;s student , and she was a teenager when they first met .
then what was their story ?
this the@@ ologi@@ an se@@ duced this girl during class , and she was only a teenager when she fell in love with her teacher .
when two people fall in love , their relationship will always yield fruit .
but theirs was not accepted by others .
a teenager as she was , this young girl Hel@@ o@@ ise was very sensible .
she knew that A@@ bel@@ ard could not marry her , because if he did , there was no chance left for him to be promoted .
so she said , &quot; You just continue your the@@ ological career , and I will serve as a n@@ un . &quot;
but this troubled her uncle .
so her uncle did something very terrible , something in@@ humane - he ca@@ str@@ ated A@@ bel@@ ard .
as a result , they could only communicate with each other through letters .
although this the@@ ologi@@ an died before his lover , they were buried together .
there is a film named Ste@@ aling Heaven based on this story .
it had an intriguing line that suggested that their death was veiled in fascinating stories .
and the line was , &quot; The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it . &quot;
this story was passed on and on .
I suppose nearly all the girls know the brand that I am going to present next ; yes , it &apos;s Ch@@ lo@@ é .
Ch@@ lo@@ é released a series of hand@@ bags in memory of Hel@@ o@@ ise , and this series was passed down generation by generation .
so en@@ chanting stories can eliminate fears .
nevertheless , in China if we build a neighborhood beside a cemetery , nobody will live there , right ?
but in France , people will strive to live in such a neighborhood .
why is that ?
it is because the ones you live with will affect who you will be in the future .
this is paramount .
if we are to become people with stories to be told , then we can die with good taste and with dignity .
although taste and dignity sound a little bit hau@@ ghty , culture can make people more cordial .
this is Oscar Wil@@ de &apos;s tomb .
although the board below shows that any friendly or harmful action to this tomb is forbidden , as you can see , people continue to damage it , not with ham@@ mers , but with kisses .
you see , his tomb is full of the lip prints of countless women .
I cannot figure out why so many women were attracted to him .
sometimes he would say things that annoyed both women and men .
for example , &quot; When a love comes to an end , weak@@ lings cry . &quot;
&quot; the effic@@ acious instantly find another love , and the wise already have one in reserve . &quot;
I hate him , because I am a weak@@ ling .
I felt miserable as he described when my first love came to an end .
back in university , what I didn &apos;t know was that my classmate who slept on the bun@@ k above mine had more than one in reserve .
this is the tomb of R@@ uan Ling@@ yu , a gorgeous actress from around the 1930s .
when we visit her tomb , we can see it is nothing but a tomb .
since she was such a charming actress , why is it that no one shows any love for her ?
we might wonder why some people died with dignity and good taste , yet a person like her cannot attract any visitors ?
you might as well pay a visit to the tomb of Marilyn Monro@@ e .
like Wil@@ de &apos;s , lip prints are all over it , and , of course , some are from men .
I have been to Mont@@ par@@ nas@@ se C@@ eme@@ tery once , and I saw the grave of Jean @-@ Paul Sar@@ tre .
when I was there , I noticed visitors brought him flowers .
and many of the visitors who come here come not with flowers but instead place their subway tickets on his grave .
you can see , there are white tickets , like this one , with gravel on them .
this proves that if someone dies with good taste and has fascinating stories , people will come from far away to worship your tomb .
I always stress that &quot; born to be great , and die glori@@ ously &quot; should be re@@ written .
as a matter of fact , being born may be an accident , but it &apos;s always preferable to die with stories .
thank you all !
yesterday , one of my friends phoned me , terrified and scared , saying that one of his relatives , who passed away two years ago , suddenly talked to him on Q@@ Q .
he asked me , &quot; Does he still exist ? &quot;
in fact , I also would like to ask this question to every one here today .
furthermore , I want to extend this question : is each of us existing at this moment ?
on what ground , do you believe that you are existing ?
before answering the question , let &apos;s play a game .
now is a perfect moment .
I hope that you can take this chance to touch the friend sitting beside you .
if this friend is the opposite sex who you have a crush on , please seize the chance to touch and feel him or her .
in fact , this kind of touch we are feeling is the most instinc@@ tive method for human being to feel each other &apos;s existence before the emergence of electricity .
today &apos;s electricity has actually changed all of this .
who can imagine that just over a hundred years ago , our human beings often felt each other &apos;s presence through a physical contact in this way in the dark moon@@ less night .
today , the emergence of electricity provides us with more of these methods to perceive the existence , and diversify our forms and content of existence .
hence , our existence becomes more stere@@ oscopic .
for instance , today , you can learn about the latest news of the relatives who are not around you through phone and know that they are at some place by recognizing their voice or through radio waves .
you also know that through the camera you can record where you have been , retain the memory that you once have been to that place and keep the moment that you have been there .
you can also see on TV the existence of friends , acquaintances and strangers in some places at one moment .
everything that we are getting today and that we are experiencing today comes from electricity , which was beyond imagination over a century ago .
therefore , these is one question I can answer , with no doubt . you are existing .
the reason is that today &apos;s cameras and the photos in the cameras of your hands can prove that you are existing at this moment at this place , &quot; T@@ n@@ Dao . &quot;
however , we don &apos;t seem to answer the first question .
the question , which ar@@ ouses the suspense , is whether the relative of my friend exists ?
how , after the physical body has disappeared for two years , is the relative able to talk to him on Q@@ Q ?
we can even further imagine and extend this question .
as his Wei@@ bo is still updating and his Facebook homepage is constantly changing , is he still existing ?
the reason why this question is difficult to answer is that the Internet makes everything perplex@@ ing .
I want to ask every one here today to think about your life one year ago and your life two years ago .
I want to ask you : who had a Nokia mobile phone three years ago ? please raise your hands .
then , please raise your hand if you still have a Nokia mobile phone today .
you can see the results by yourselves .
in this era of rapid Internet evolution , there is no doubt that each of us is spending more time on the Internet .
we surf on the Internet , read e @-@ mails , update or browse Wei@@ bo , talk with friends on We@@ Chat , communicate with our family and our business partners through other instant messaging tools and watch videos online and go shopping online .
when we have these behaviors , as a saying goes , those behaviors are actually an impression on your mindset .
to some extent , your behaviors are actually printing your mindset in the digital world in this way .
that is to say , the digital traces of each of our actions today are actually like a digital printer .
all of our offline physical behaviors are printed in a digital mirror .
in this kind of digital mirror , the image of each of us starts to be gathered , accumulated and formed .
can such a digital impression completely describe each of us ?
certainly , not .
can the digital impression exist completely independent of a physical impression ?
I am afraid not necessarily today , but I believe is that no one can deny one thing that we are all becoming a node .
for instance , before the era of electricity and in the era without light , each of us feels each other &apos;s existence through touching bodies .
in the era of electricity , we extend our perception through a variety of extended electric devices .
then , today or even in the future , we will witness the emergence of digital handshake .
each of us will have a digital impression inside a digital mirror .
your digital impression will greet that of your friends .
they will chat , communicate or even trade with each other .
let &apos;s imagine a possible scenario where the digital impression gradually develops as the digital behavior increases .
gradually , the digital impression can even be independent of the physical existence we see today and own its unique thinking path .
recently , there is a film called Source Code .
I don &apos;t know how many audience here today have watched it already .
in fact , it depicts a mirror image of this kind .
that is , a person , who has already passed away , still lives in a digital world by some way .
through the digital world , he can communicate with the people he has contacted and the people who are still alive .
perhaps from this perspective , the relative of my friend still exists .
as long as there is any digital trace , there may be a seed of life .
that is to say , to certain extent , we are all printed to be a source code .
we are all possible to develop a new self based on the source code , completely different from our physical impression today and evolution path .
this is a huge change brought about by the inter@@ ne@@ tization and living in a digit@@ alized world .
some may say that today we are experiencing a digital era and living in a society with over@@ loaded information .
everyone is terrified . this is a very bad era .
others may say that today we are living in a very good era , because we can experience unpreced@@ ent@@ edly great changes , in our survival , our life and our work , brought by the digit@@ alized world .
let &apos;s imagine if such a digital image can really exist completely independent of our physical existence , then what is it ?
perhaps there is a phrase for it , that is , &quot; eternal being . &quot;
is eternal being equivalent to immortality ?
over thousands of years , immortality has always been one problem un@@ solved by human being .
first Emperor of Qin attempted to find pan@@ ace@@ as for immortality by dispatching children , young men and women , but failed .
until today , although mankind has overcome many diseases , but still cannot un@@ tangle the problem of immortality .
let &apos;s think about it . perhaps , immortality is a problem which cannot be solved by making up for shortcomings .
instead , your life can be extended in a completely reconstructed way .
the reason is , theoretically , as a wise creature , the existence of our mindset and brain waves proves our existence to some extent .
therefore , this era may be a very bad or very good one , but I personally think this is a great one .
the reason is that we are fortunate to experience the tremendous changes in our life and work by living in a digit@@ alized world .
we are fortunate to enjoy the quality life and rich experience brought by this change .
more importantly , we may witness the greatest sub@@ ver@@ sive changes in the history of human existence , or in terms of survival .
therefore , it can be said that this is a more important era with ep@@ och@@ al significance .
I think this era is one with the potential for immortality .
thank you !
may I ask you a question ?
do you have kids ?
please hands up if you do .
there are some .
um , not really .
do your kids love video games ?
please hands up if the answer is yes .
do you have any idea why they love video games ?
do you love video games ?
no , I don &apos;t .
I love it .
I really love playing video games .
why ?
I don &apos;t know .
I just love it .
I gradually figured out why after playing for a while .
the more you play , the deeper you get addicted to it .
it brings you to a whole new world .
one day , my son , my 16 @-@ year @-@ old , eldest son said , &quot; Dad , I feel depressed recently . &quot;
and I asked , &quot; What &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
he said , &quot; Mum keeps n@@ agging me about being a &apos; chair person . &quot; &quot;
you see what I mean .
o@@ ops .
it &apos;s about video games again .
I said , &quot; Son , you are already 16 and will be a college student in a year or two@@ .@@ Just let your mother say whatever she likes , for it will not be long before you leave home@@ .When you go to university , you will not be bothered by your mother &apos;s daily mum@@ bling . &quot;
my son immediately grasped the meaning and said , &quot; Right , Dad is surely right . &quot;
then he went to co@@ ax his mother .
I felt sympath@@ ized with my son .
so I went to talk with his mother .
his mother complained , &quot; He &apos;s been sitting there all day long , playing games . he &apos;s so immersed in it that he would ignore my repeated lunch @-@ time reminder . &quot;
and I asked , &quot; My dear wife , let me ask you a few questions . &quot;
our Q &amp; A was brief .
I asked , &quot; How did our son perform in the high @-@ school entrance exam ? &quot;
she answered , &quot; He ranked No.1 in his class . &quot;
I asked again , &quot; Which high school was he admitted to ? &quot;
&quot; Beijing No.@@ 4 High School . &quot;
a top high school in China .
I continued to ask , &quot; How does he perform there ? &quot;
she answered , &quot; He &apos;s done a pretty good job and is thoughtful , according to his teachers . &quot;
I thus said , &quot; Then just let him play it as much as he wishes . &quot;
how come my son loved video games so much ?
I needed to figure it out .
I asked my son if I could join him in playing games .
he said , &quot; Dad , you are forty now and you are kind of slow . maybe you can do &apos; energy transfusion &quot; like a &apos; wet nurse &quot; behind me . &quot;
please hands up if you know what &quot; energy transfusion &quot; is .
there are many .
good !
I thus followed him in the game , doing &quot; energy transfusion . &quot;
one time I was one second slower and was &quot; beaten &quot; by his fellow classmates .
do you know what they said ?
they said how silly the &quot; wet nurse &quot; was .
and my son responded , &quot; Shu@@ t up . that &apos;s my dad . &quot;
suddenly , his classmates went crazy .
wow !
your dad &apos;s cool .
that made my son very proud of me and told them that his dad was the &quot; wet nurse &quot; doing &quot; energy transfusion &quot; for him .
I played the role of a psych@@ o beauty , you see .
why ?
because no one would like to let you in unless you are a beauty .
you see what I mean .
why ?
I &apos;d like to share my view here today .
be it in virtual games or in reality , there &apos;s not much that we can draw on to educate our children .
I was born in the 1960s and witnessed the Cultural Revolution with my parents &quot; generation .
one lesson they learnt from the Cultural Revolution was that never trust anyone .
that &apos;s not something I &apos;m supposed to pass it onto my son .
nor will he believe it .
he loves his bud@@ dies .
I &apos;m not supposed to tell him that all business models in China are about the &quot; last @-@ minute &quot; issue , we will just take whatever our foreign friends have come up with .
why bother innov@@ ating when you can copy ?
am I supposed to tell him that , &quot; Son , since you are on your own after college , maybe I should just send you to America now during vacations so that you could figure out what young Americans are into now and how things work there . then you could come back with all that . &quot;
should I say those to him ?
is that positive influence ?
should I show him the dark side of society and tell him it &apos;s all about connections ?
am I supposed to educate him that way ?
I &apos;m sorry to tell you this but our children know far more than we do .
he told me that he knew the dark side of society more than I did .
am I supposed to tell him to pretend his father is a certain &quot; Mr. Big , &quot; not Mr. Xu ?
can I do that ?
of course not .
we often bra@@ g about how much we have accomplished to the younger generation born in the 8@@ 0s and 9@@ 0s .
we believe China &apos;s extraordinary achievements in the Reform and Opening @-@ up and economic growth all owe to our generation .
and we have already surpassed Europe , the UK in particular and Japan , and is approaching the USA .
is that something that I should bra@@ g about ?
he once said to me , &quot; Dad , indeed , many of your generation have made a big fortune ; but they just seem busy with emigration .
it has taken us over three decades to become rich , but it will probably take us over 100 years to curb environmental pollution .
we have been busy accumulating wealth since the past three decades .
however , China , the birthplace of Confucius and Men@@ ci@@ us doctrine , has witnessed serious ethical fading .
am I supposed to tell him that ?
it may take us two to three hundred years to raise our moral standard to due level .
now I have a guilty conscience when it comes to parenting .
the funny thing is The Global Times enjoys a huge popularity among Chinese people .
they may have some foreign friends as I do .
but that does not impair their enthusiasm for The Global Times .
I don &apos;t think we can educate our children well when we are so self @-@ contradic@@ ted .
it is not our children , but us that are to blame .
it is not they , but us that are silly .
in fact , many new terms today were invented by our children .
for example , &quot; holy shit . &quot;
what does &quot; holy shit &quot; mean ?
I am not sure if writers of our generation understand it .
if they do , they &apos;d better explain it .
if not , I won &apos;t feel surprised .
anyway , there are stuff that we simply cannot tell them .
when we were young , at least they could &quot; brain@@ wash &quot; us with the mainstream ideology like &quot; Follow Lei Feng &apos;s example . &quot;
when I attempted to educate my son with Uncle Lei Feng &apos;s deeds , he just commented , &quot; C@@ ool ! Lei Feng &apos;s surely awesome . &quot;
I also have a 14 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
I once took her to the Disneyland .
I asked , &quot; Hey , honey , do you like it ? &quot;
my daughter answered , &quot; Do you want to hear the truth , dad ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes , go ahead . &quot;
then she said , &quot; The only reason we go to the Disneyland and play with Barbie dolls is that we want to do the things that you grown @-@ ups suppose we will like . I can just fake a &quot; wow &quot; at Disneyland but inside I was like &quot; ew@@ w . &quot;
she added , &quot; To be frank , dad , this is my first and also the last trip to the Disneyland . it &apos;s just so silly . &quot;
can you expect my 14 @-@ year @-@ old daughter to enjoy such dolls ?
no way .
kids today prefer something real .
so let &apos;s stop talking nonsense .
people of our generation tend to be more hypoc@@ ri@@ tical .
for example , we may end a phone call by telling the caller we are at a conference and will call back later .
so hypoc@@ ri@@ tical , aren &apos;t we ?
I hate to be disturbed by a call while I &apos;m concentrating on something .
once , the moment I picked up a phone call , I directly said to the other side , &quot; you know what , I &apos;m busy playing games . who the hell are you ? &quot;
after I hanged up , I heard over head@@ set my teammates urging others .
I told them I had to stop for a while and go out .
then I called back . the caller just now turned out to be my father .
seriously , no kidding .
I immediately turned to a much softer tone , &quot; Hey , dad , I &apos;ll call you back later . OK ? &quot;
had it been someone else , I &apos;d say , &quot; I &apos;m busy playing games . bye . &quot;
what makes video games so fascinating to kids ?
I can assure you that there are many brilliant ideas and visual fe@@ asts in those games .
why did so many Chinese movies fail ?
because they couldn &apos;t even compare with games in terms of visual effect .
honesty exists in games .
for example , my son &apos;s classmates expect me online at 8 : 05 tonight .
to live up to their expectation , I must show up on time .
should you be in my position , could you fail your son by refusing their game invitation ?
as a &quot; wet nurse , &quot; you must keep your word .
in the world of video games , our territory may be grabbed , our home be burgl@@ ed , and our fellow@@ men be killed .
the next day , one single call from our team leader would unite us all to counter@@ attack and kill them all . that &apos;s it .
as the old saying goes , when fighting a battle , rely on your father and brothers .
if I lose my territory in a game , I &apos;m supposed to take it back immediately .
in reality , however , we haven &apos;t taken any lost territory back over the past century .
have we ?
according to The Global Times , we may have taken a little back .
isn &apos;t that ironic ?
what can we find in video games ?
passion , patriotism and democracy .
for example , parliamentary system is exercised in our team .
so , you can at least have a vote in a game , which is cool .
video games are all @-@ inclusive .
and this virtual world has one thing in common with real world , that is , basic cultural elements .
China is now experiencing rapid cultural development , what have we achieve ?
we are now the publisher who have issued most publications worldwide .
yet , you cannot find many world @-@ renowned men of letters in current China .
there are many writers , though .
by contrast , new terms keep emerging from the game world .
those terms , I - Xu K@@ e assume , will become a starting point of China &apos;s cultural rejuven@@ ation .
I don &apos;t wanna say too much today , for this topic can trigger endless discussions .
we don &apos;t have so much time .
now , with the new born coming to my family , I have three kids .
will the director please show the picture of my nine @-@ month @-@ old baby ?
last week , I said to him , &quot; Son , do learn from Uncle Lei Feng . &quot;
upon hearing that , my son replied , &quot; Shu@@ t up ! &quot;
just kidding .
he is now only 9 months old . how can he say that ?
as a father of such a little kid , I recall the old saying in the Three Character Cl@@ assic that &quot; man on earth , good at birth . &quot;
I ask myself , &quot; What should I bring to such an innocent kid ? &quot;
just stay true to my conscience and I will surely do good parenting .
thank you all .
actually , I &apos;ve been regarding myself as a very proud Chinese for the past 70 years .
the election campaign of Ma Ying @-@ je@@ ou as our President just ended , and I find my identity of being an ordinary Chinese is growing more important .
we surpassed Japan in GDP growth in 2009 , making China the G@@ 2 .
G and two , OK !
so in fact , I think China will out@@ do the US in around 2030 .
it &apos;s inevitable .
for me , I lecture in economics in college .
so why did our host introduced me as a self @-@ claimed traveling artist just now ?
because painting is my dream since I was a little kid .
so I grew long hair and beard since my retirement 9 years ago , looking like an artist and going traveling around the world , this is the dream of my life .
we all have to make a 10 @-@ year plan for ourselves , and in fact I &apos;m planning for my life at 70 and 80 .
and I &apos;m thinking if there is anything to which I want to devote all my time , my experience and my life in this ten @-@ year time .
several lectu@@ rers on this stage before me have already talked about this actually , that &apos;s because today &apos;s China is ready to take off and Chinese people have to be proud and confident being who we are .
but do we really understand what our mothers taught us all these years ?
of the five @-@ thousand @-@ year history of our nation , the Chinese character has come into being for three thousand and five hundreds years .
so learning Chinese characters is what I really want to do in the rest of my life .
during my 21 years of living in Shanghai , I learned the meaning of &quot; dev@@ oting one &apos;s remaining energy . &quot;
so I &apos;m going to keep doing it till I run out my last energy .
so this is what I &apos;m going to talk about with you tonight , and it &apos;s about the language and the characters of our mothers .
so what are the lessons we &apos;ve been taught from the 5000 @-@ year civilization , and have we really understood ?
I think this part is going to be interesting .
first I &apos;d like to talk about &quot; Dao . &quot;
we all know &quot; Dao . &quot;
as in &quot; Do you know Da@@ ol@@ i &quot; or &quot; Are you reasonable ? &quot;
&quot; how can you be so unreasonable ? &quot;
the word &quot; Dao &quot; is frequently used .
there may be a hundred different books talking about the &quot; Dao &quot; and &quot; Yi &quot; in Chinese culture .
there are many indeed .
but do we really understand the true philosophy behind them ?
it is actually hard .
so I &apos;d like to take advantage of this 15 minutes to discuss with you the philosophy of the &quot; Dao &quot; passed down from our mothers .
my understanding goes like this : first of all , the character &quot; Sh@@ ou &quot; refers to our head , there is no doubt about that .
then the ind@@ exing component means walking on your own feet .
so if Chinese people want to catch up and surpass people like Bill Gates , Steve Jobs and Mark Z@@ uc@@ ker@@ berg , there &apos;s only one way we should consider taking , and that is walking your path with your own head .
by doing this , we finally understand the essence of the &quot; dao . &quot;
&quot; Dao &quot; is in fact easy to grasp .
how exactly ?
it is so easy that it is kinda funny .
let &apos;s look at the word &quot; Z@@ en . &quot;
the word &quot; Z@@ en &quot; was borrowed actually .
&quot; Z@@ en &quot; is not Chinese , it is rather a lo@@ an@@ word from the Ar@@ yan , according to my mother .
with the foreign pronunciation of &quot; Z@@ en , &quot; our Chinese ancestors invented the word .
each Chinese character symbolizes in fact a image , just like the icon on our computers , our phone , especially our smart phones .
as we all know , Bill Gates and Steve Jobs , their war is in fact mainly about the creation of icon , which could easily translate into valuable asset , just as Chinese characters do .
for example , the character &quot; Z@@ en &quot; is simple , yet we could write 50 thousand books to explain it .
but for &quot; Z@@ en , &quot; what our mothers , our ancestors did is to use their heart to explain this character .
with only efforts but no heart , a successful life would be in vain .
then the Chinese people would be a tragedy for the society and for the world !
people say there are four villain countries in the world , and one of which we always refuse to admit .
the problem is , if we don &apos;t behave with a kind heart and we don &apos;t follow the philosophy of Confucius that &quot; To honor the aged people of other families as we treat our own ; to care for the children of others &apos; as we do to our own , &quot; then we are not caring .
just as if we don &apos;t care if other people &apos;s mother , grandmother or grandfather is hit by a car or if other children was died in a car accident .
although the word &quot; Z@@ en &quot; is originally Ar@@ yan , what it wants to say is be simple .
to act simple and think simple with your heart , this is &quot; Z@@ en . &quot;
similarly , the &quot; Z@@ en spirits , &quot; &quot; Z@@ en style , &quot; &quot; Z@@ en master , &quot; &quot; Z@@ en philosophy , &quot; there are nothing complicated about them .
apart from &quot; Z@@ en , &quot; are there other borrowed words ?
I prepared some interesting characters , such as &quot; Ye &quot; and &quot; fo &quot; which is also borrowed .
upon my study , I concluded that of 1,800 Chinese characters , about 300 of which are Ban@@ ana language .
banana language is words with yellow skin and a Chinese vi@@ be while the content is borrowed from other cultures .
we all know that the Ar@@ yan people are ancestors of Sak@@ y@@ am@@ un@@ i , who is not asian but white with white curly hair .
there is an interesting phenomenon in the process of word borrowing in China : the words imported or exported were more pos@@ tive during the prosperous time of China .
as China began to decline , we became more un@@ confident and self @-@ pit@@ ying .
the words exported were more or less negative .
I found some instances in this case .
&quot; tea &quot; for example , was introduced from China to the world .
it is called &quot; Tea &quot; in English .
&quot; tea &quot; pron@@ ounces the same way as &quot; Di@@ e &quot; in Southern Fujian Di@@ al@@ ect and Hak@@ ka .
so this is where &quot; Tea &quot; came from .
by far I have found as many as about 400 Chinese words along with their pron@@ unci@@ ations exported and populated in all corners of the world .
these words are lingu@@ a franc@@ a indeed .
let &apos;s say the word &quot; China , &quot; which we all know .
it &apos;s a porcelain or the country of China , isn &apos;t ?
China is the country name , but we know it &apos;s a Chinese character , nor an English word or a porcelain at all .
if we could read and understand the words and language of our mothers , we would know that the word &quot; China &quot; came from an ancient town in Jiangxi Province , north of Jing@@ de@@ zhen , south of the Chan@@ ghe River .
the town names Chang@@ nan .
Chang@@ nan was the then world @-@ renowned town of hi @-@ tech products .
por@@ cel@@ ains were r@@ arity back then .
a porcelain then equ@@ alizes an iP@@ ad today .
por@@ cel@@ ains were then hi @-@ tech in the world , whoever wanted one should go to Chang@@ nan !
despite the change of dynasties and countries , Chang@@ nan remained intact there .
over time , where did foreigners who cr@@ aved for por@@ cel@@ ains go ?
Chang@@ nan !
hence the word &quot; China . &quot;
Chang@@ nan was a major porcelain producer , so it is called &quot; China , &quot; so the English of &quot; China &quot; actually came from China .
another interesting thing is that we found lots of characters that are exported from China , we call it the &quot; Duck egg words . &quot;
altogether there &apos;re over 400 duck egg words .
take &quot; Cas@@ ino &quot; for example , what does it mean ?
casino means a gambling house .
so is it an English word ?
perhaps some foreigners would regard it as a pure English word .
but now we know that the word &quot; Cas@@ ino &quot; was created by Chinese workers from Fujian and Guangdong who were sent to America to build railways .
they would shout &quot; Here we go &quot; that sounds like &quot; Cas@@ ino &quot; in Cantonese , before getting off work .
then what were they going to do ?
gambling .
hence the word &quot; Cas@@ ino . &quot;
in fact , we know for sure &quot; Cas@@ ino &quot; was exported to western world from China , I have not talked about the numerous cases of word borrowing from China to Japan , to South Korea , to Thailand or to Vietnam .
we have found more than 400 English words that were borrowed from Chinese .
so if we have enough time and I hope it would be 10 or 20 years for me .
I would be 90 in 20 years .
I &apos;m getting 70 this year and my mother 104 , so I believe I still have a long life ahead .
I &apos;ve encountered twice air accident , one of which killed 76 passengers .
I survived .
so I know when I cross the street , there is a chance of getting hit by a car .
putting accidents aside , I think we should make a long term plan for ourselves .
when you &apos;re devoted to something , you &apos;d find what your mother said was true .
I can also understand more thoroughly all the sense my mother talked about .
with this , more people would be attracted to other Chinese characters .
to hold your attention I &apos;d like to show you the changes of numbers .
we all know these numbers and we write in Arabic number@@ als , don &apos;t we ?
we use them all day without knowing that how long we Chinese people have been using them .
at the end of the Zhou Dynasty , Chinese numbers have been divided into 8 categories , passing down everywhere in the country .
for instance , people in Suzhou had their own way of writing , which was actually inherited from the way back in the Wu State .
in the screen you could see that on the very top is what people in Suzhou wrote , &quot; Suzhou numer@@ als &quot; and most Chinese merchants were using them .
we also have computer language which is equally interesting .
at the bottom we could see P@@ AL@@ M , the PD@@ A is composed of lines .
so the question is where were Arabic numer@@ als originally came from ?
it would be fun to know the birth place .
so where ?
people say it is Arabian .
but why Arabic numer@@ als had to be look like 1 , 2 , and 3 ?
we now know that all numbers and words , Chinese words included , must come from somewhere , and that &apos;s essential .
from the numbers we could de@@ duce that Arabic numer@@ als weren &apos;t from the Arab countries , it was the Indians who invented these numbers .
however , if you still recall what I have talked about earlier , you would find it interesting where came the Indian numbers .
from China !
we think that the numbers we &apos;re writing are Arabic , and even the whole world name it Arabic numer@@ als .
unfortunately , they were brought by Arabian sailors from India .
if you dig further , you will find that there were already numbers 3000 years ago in China , then you will see that these numer@@ als were exported from China .
so why &quot; 1 &quot; looks like this ?
because &quot; 1 &quot; has only one angle .
I suggest you all to look at &quot; 2 , &quot; how many angles then ?
yes , two .
what about &quot; 3 &quot; ?
how many angles now ?
three .
and &quot; 4 &quot; ?
four of course .
and &quot; 5 &quot; ?
and &quot; 6 &quot; ?
and &quot; 7 &quot; ?
please note that many people still write the number &quot; 7 &quot; this way , which is exactly the same as ancient Chinese did .
but Indians didn &apos;t write that way , if you recall the numbers in last page .
so if you find all this interesting , you could download my slides and study at home .
alright , here &apos;s the number &quot; 8 , &quot; o@@ ops , where is &quot; 8 &quot; ?
where is the number &quot; 8 &quot; ?
OK , here &apos;s &quot; 8 . &quot;
it has 8 angles for sure .
finally the number &quot; 9 &quot; with 9 angles .
it &apos;s called cloud @-@ shaped writing in China .
when we visit Chinese temples in the Imperial Palace in Beijing or the National Palace Museum in Taipei , we would find numerous symbols and structures in a cloud @-@ form .
such patterns means &quot; 9 &quot; that suggests immortality or longevity in Chinese .
but only one place is allowed to put these auspicious patterns .
the imperial palace !
ordinary people were forbidden to use it .
therefore it &apos;s called &quot; 9 &quot; because of its 9 angles in writing .
last but not least , the number &quot; 0 . &quot; it &apos;s called zero as it has no angle at all .
the origins of these numbers were found and used by our great ancestors , our mothers back in 3,000 years ago .
as descendants , we survived 100 @-@ year @-@ long wartime such as the First Sino @-@ Japanese War , the First O@@ pi@@ um War and the Si@@ ege of the International leg@@ ations , we have been seeking a new path .
today China &apos;s GDP growth ranks the second in the world , and by 2030 China would lead the world by its currency .
it is not a dream .
the question is where is our culture ?
earlier tonight I listened to some former lectures talked about Chinese morality .
could we listen carefully and understand the words of our mothers ?
could we really learn something from the language of our mothers ?
if we could earnestly try to understand , to learn , to respect our ancestors and their heritage , I think there will be a new path for Chinese people .
a new China would definitely set out at that beginning .
so , it is important to listen to the &quot; Dao . &quot;
how to listen and understand ?
how to behave ?
how to do your work properly ?
these are the things that need to be elaborated at T@@ n@@ Dao tonight .
thank you very much for giving me the precious 15 minutes to share with you some extraordinary ideas in ordinary words .
ordinary words with extraordinary ideas .
thank you so much !
thank you !
thank you !
today , I &apos;d like to share with you my understanding of the big and the small .
according to Tao@@ ism , &quot; The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao . &quot;
today , I &apos;d like to adapt it into &quot; The small that can be seen is not the essential small . &quot;
let me start with a small kettle .
the kettle was designed by Michael Gr@@ aves , a very well @-@ known American architect .
he also made this kettle a most well @-@ known one .
it was actually designed for the famous Italian brand Al@@ ess@@ i in 1985 .
this kettle features a bird @-@ shaped whistle at the end of the sp@@ out , which t@@ wee@@ ts when the water comes to a boil .
then , you just need to hold its handle to pour the water out .
as we know , usually you need to tilt the kettle to pour the water out .
but with this design , the water will just spill out naturally .
its designer Michael Gr@@ aves is quite an accomplished architect whose master@@ pieces include the Port@@ land Building ( Oregon ) , the Human@@ a Building ( Lou@@ is@@ ville ) , as well as Walt Disney World S@@ wan and Dol@@ ph@@ in Res@@ or@@ ts ( Florida ) .
moreover , his works can also be seen in the Chinese cities of Xiamen and Shanghai .
he pays special attention to designing daily household items such as tea cups , bird &apos;s nests and mail boxes .
he prefers to approach art from small items that are most familiar to him in everyday life .
it happens that there is another well @-@ known US architect who designed a bus shelter for a French company for mass production .
in a non @-@ Car@@ tes@@ ian coordinates form , the shelter was supported by fol@@ dable steel plates .
and it was made in A@@ ach@@ en , a small city in Germany .
it may seem nothing extraordinary , but this small shelter has its own merit .
when we wait for bus , we always prefer to see it coming without being exposed to the rain .
so , the shelter is supposed to keep out wind and rain , and prevent naughty kids from climbing over it , too .
it stretches like a king@@ crab , with an electronic screen in front of it to indicate time and present other information .
these details were also designed by the architect .
in this sense , small items are not really small and they contain a complex set of knowledge .
let &apos;s turn our topic from foreign kettle to Chinese lake .
lake is a must for a traditional Chinese garden , which is a miniature of the &quot; heaven and earth . &quot;
traditional Chinese garden features a design philosophy of &quot; seeing a bigger picture through the small . &quot;
it usually covers an area of several mu and contains dwell@@ ings and pav@@ ili@@ ons .
what &apos;s special about it ?
it is its mysterious and en@@ chanting spatial layout of multi @-@ layered hills , flowing streams , exquisite bridges , winding corridors , as well as many walls , window openings and moon gates .
according to traditional Chinese culture , garden falls into the category of tool .
as the saying in the Book of Changes goes , &quot; What is above form is called Dao ; what is under form is called a tool . &quot;
how is this &quot; tool &quot; associated with Dao ?
apart from being a tool , Chinese garden also symbolizes the philosophy of Dao .
let me tell you a story .
it &apos;s about the famous philosopher Zhu@@ ang@@ zi .
one day , Zhu@@ ang@@ zi followed his friend Hu@@ iz@@ i to a lu@@ cid river .
seeing some fish in the river , Zhu@@ ang@@ zi said to Hu@@ iz@@ i , &quot; How happy the fish are in the river . &quot;
and Hu@@ iz@@ i questioned , &quot; How do you know they are happy now that you &apos;re not fish ? &quot;
Zhu@@ ang@@ zi argued , &quot; How do you know that I don &apos;t know it now that you &apos;re not me ? &quot;
their dialogue concerns logic and philosophy .
influenced by that story , traditional Chinese gardens today , like Yu Garden , usually feature a fish @-@ appreciation pavilion .
that is how an ancient philosophical story is put into Chinese gardens .
so , small as it may be , a traditional Chinese garden contains profound implications .
take the Master @-@ of @-@ N@@ ets Garden in Suzhou as an example .
this exquisite garden only covers an area of 8 mu but it contains many structures , including dwell@@ ings .
and the Ming Dynasty @-@ style garden court at the M@@ et , New York was modeled on a courtyard of that garden .
thus you can see , traditional Chinese gardens are culture @-@ loaded , built on the philosophy of &quot; following the law of nature and the Creator . &quot;
as an old Chinese saying goes , &quot; The wise find pleasure in water ; the virtuous find pleasure in hills . &quot;
and a traditional Chinese garden , with a lake symbol@@ izing the &quot; heaven and earth , &quot; has it all .
there is also another old Chinese saying that &quot; A straw shows which way the wind blows , &quot; meaning from a small clue one can see what is coming .
this view was initially proposed by Zhu Xi , a philosopher in the Song Dynasty .
one day , when he was reading , he saw a pond .
and it suddenly occurred to him that &quot; There lies a gl@@ assy ob@@ long pool . where light and shade pursue their course . how could it be so clear and cool ? for fresh water comes from the source . &quot;
in other words , to keep your mind clear , you should keep refreshing it with new thoughts so that it can keep pace with the times .
the little pond , no more than half mu , about 300 square meters , inspired Zhu Xi .
similarly , La@@ o@@ zi used to say , &quot; Small the &apos; Dao &quot; may be , nothing in the world can transcend it or force it to sub@@ jection . &quot;
Chinese people prefer everything that is big .
according to Xu Shen &apos;s shu@@ ow@@ en Ji@@ ez@@ i , the Chinese character for &quot; beauty &quot; consists of two characters , namely , &quot; sheep &quot; and &quot; big . &quot;
so a big sheep was deemed beautiful by ancient Chinese .
but in fact , the big in the eyes of Chinese comprises a diversity of the small .
according to La@@ o@@ zi , the greatest sound seems sound@@ less ; the greatest image seems form@@ less ; the greatest perfection seems imperfect , and yet its use is in@@ exhaustible ; the greatest fullness seems empty , and yet its use is endless ; the greatest strai@@ ghtness seems twisted ; the greatest intelligence seems stupid ; the great eloqu@@ ence seems awkward .
such words are not just about the big , but also but the small .
but today we are too obs@@ essive about being big .
in urban construction , we want big budgets , big law@@ ns and big squares .
this is the municipal government building of Tai &apos;an , whose Party secretary told me that it was his design .
he just asked his assistant to hold a little flag to help him mapping .
we all know poet Du Fu &apos;s famous verse that &quot; I must ascend the mountain &apos;s crest ; it dwar@@ fs all peaks under my feet . &quot;
now , it seems that many people don &apos;t have to ascend the Mount Tai to dwarf all peaks .
many of us prefer everything that &apos;s big , such as big @-@ budget movie , big and grand narrative and big academic perspective .
so much so that they ignore the small and overes@@ timate themselves .
where is it ?
Me@@ ishan , hometown to Su Dong@@ po .
I went there years ago .
it &apos;s a small city with a population of 200 to 300 thousand , but it had a 100 meters wide broad@@ way without much traffic .
in the middle of the broad@@ way , there was a pavilion for real estate promotion . how ridiculous !
we seem to believe the bigger , the better .
last time when I was in Chongqing , I felt the Yangtze River became smaller . why ?
&apos;cause the city was getting bigger .
with skyscrapers erec@@ ting everywhere , the Yangtze River and the Ji@@ aling River of course looked smaller .
should we maintain this pursuit of &quot; bigger . &quot;
I really doubt it .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s the Tian@@ anmen Square in Beijing .
and there are the Great Hall of the People , National Center for the Per@@ forming Arts , and so on , all big and grand .
that reminds me of a story .
it &apos;s about Mr. Tan Yuan , who was a teacher of mine at university .
it &apos;s a pity that he passed away in 1999 .
he excell@@ ed at architectural design .
he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 19@@ 29 with a mat@@ er &apos;s degree .
he was very rigorous in design .
we all looked up to him with reverence and nick@@ named him &quot; resilient surface . &quot;
he was full of momentum when modifying drawings .
when he was given a fine pencil , he would immediately throw it away .
he preferred 6@@ B , a thick and long one .
when he was modifying a drawing , he was always en@@ circled by many students . some even stood on sto@@ ols to see more clearly .
he was indeed a man with high standards .
the Great Hall of the People was designed by his student , who showed him around it in 1961 .
he said , &quot; You seem to have forgotten all the skills I taught you . you went too far . &quot;
when he returned , he did a presentation , arguing the hall was big , but not great .
just imagine how bold he was for an ordinary professor to dare say so .
later , he was strongly denounced during the 1964 Design Revolution and then the Cultural Revolution .
what he meant is that it is not necessarily the bigger , the greater .
sometimes , we can see something big and profound through the small .
that &apos;s my point today - seeing a bigger picture through the small .
accordingly , only when we pay more attention to details can we truly achieve more .
thank you all .
I think life is short .
of scores of problems we have to solve in this short life , learning is one which all of us cannot neglect .
either as a kid or an adult , we all have to keep learning as a way to maintain our vitality .
I do not know if you can still remember that when we were in our childhood , all almost every one of us , at least me , would raise a hand every time our teacher posed the question &quot; Can anyone answer my question ? &quot;
looking around the classroom , I found all children in the classroom had raised their hand .
why are children so active ?
this is because they are simple and straightforward .
if they knew the answer , they would say they know , and if they don &apos;t know , they would say they don &apos;t know .
they have no qual@@ ms about asking questions .
however , as we get older , when we enter middle school and university , and on some social occasions that require someone to answer a question , only when the teacher or the host call someone &apos;s name could he get the answer .
what lies behind this phenomenon ?
was it impu@@ table to our vanity that grows with age as we become increasingly engaged in social activities ?
in fact , we began to be concerned with the outcomes .
the concern is that if I gave a bad answer , would I lose face or would my image be tar@@ n@@ ished in the eyes of others .
to put it more exactly , it is the image that you suppose others have of you that you fear might be dist@@ ained .
when I was a student , I kept no secrets from my room@@ mates and classmates .
and we studied together and hung out together .
however , after we started working , when asked by our colleagues : &quot; what will you do this weekend ? &quot;
you might reply : &quot; well , I am too tired this week , so I just want to stay at home . &quot; or &quot; I feel like to do some shopping . &quot;
it is reasonable that all we want to do is to relax after a busy week of work .
as a matter of fact , some may avail themselves of their spare time to learn some new skills .
nonetheless , why do they choose to veil the truth ?
I suppose there are two reasons behind this .
one is that you have not truly mastered the new skills and are afraid of being ridic@@ ul@@ ed by others due to a lack of confidence .
the other one is you are so confident .
you worry that the fact of you mast@@ ering new skills will apply more pressure on your peers and make you seem difficult to work with .
when we set our foot into a new industry , we have no hesitation in asking questions if we do not know the answer to a question .
but , after we scored some achievements , held some important positions and enjoyed higher status , especially when others tell you so , you might be afraid of asking questions .
particularly , under no conditions will you ask your infer@@ iors questions for the fear of being embarrassed .
in this way , we seem to wear a mask that covers our pure int@@ ents of learning .
despite this , is learning an inherent need of human beings just like eating or sleeping ?
to answer this question , I want to share with you two small stories .
the first one is about my father .
my father was a well @-@ known Er@@ hu master in our city .
not only did he play the two @-@ str@@ inged bowed instrument well , but also he have taught a large number of students , many of which have won big prizes in major cities such as Beijing , some therefore took an artistic path .
but actually my father has never received any professional training .
to be exact , he managed to become an expert of Er@@ hu totally by his own efforts .
born in a family engaged in salt business , my father is surrounded , if you could imagine , by workers employed to make salt .
for those workers , what matters most is to be muscular and have great physical strength so that they can do as much work as possible .
however , my father was not interested in all of this .
in his spare time , he would sit on piles of bags containing salt and learn Er@@ hu on his own , playing what he has heard on the radio .
as you can imagine , in a salt plant without any acoustic shielding board , every time the instrument was played , the tune res@@ ounded throughout the village .
the villagers were pretty worried for my grandfather for fear that my father might not be able to stay on track .
my grandfather , who was also really v@@ exed , made a decision to retire pre@@ mat@@ urely so that my father could take his position as a salt worker .
terrified by this decision , he sne@@ aked to another city for the hope that my grandfather could not find him .
what he feared most was deprivation of the chance to do what he loved .
as a teenager , playing the instrument was even more important than eating .
in fact , food is the most important part of life at that time .
this is the story of my father .
the next one is a personal story of mine .
I fell in love with painting when I was still a little child .
unfortunately , at that time , we only had one art lesson a week .
I can still remember my last art lesson in the second year of junior high school .
it was also the last lesson of the semester .
after the lesson , the l@@ is@@ ping art teacher , who was not very good @-@ looking and slo@@ ven@@ ly dressed , asked me : &quot; Fu Cair@@ ui , do you want to learn painting with me ? I will tutor you personally after school , free of charge . &quot;
as a child , I could not make the decision .
as a result , I came to my father who was the most well @-@ educated one in my family .
my father discontinued his education after the third year of junior high school .
since the second year of junior high school , he began to engage with Red Gu@@ ards and this continued during the third year .
however , he was luck@@ ier than my mother who began dancing and touring with other girls of China &apos;s Art Trou@@ pe since she was still a fourth or fifth grade pupil .
at hearing of my question , my father replied : &quot; what is more important than mast@@ ering M@@ ath , Physics and Chemistry nowadays ? how much difference does art make ? &quot;
therefore , I thought then that my life would have nothing to do with art .
after I went to college , one day I saw a banner on the campus that read &quot; Do you want a email of your own &quot; in Chinese .
at that point , I did not know what a email was .
intrigu@@ ed , I stepped into the computer room as indicated in the banner .
it was actually the first time that I saw a computer .
I was able to know a thing called &quot; Windows &quot; which featured abundant colors and patterns .
in addition , I was also amazed by a place called the Internet where I can share my ideas with others .
at that time , I could feel the art genes that considered dead and frozen in different parts of my body re@@ united .
they were not dead ! they were just fast asleep .
finally , when the supervisor of the computer room had to ask me , the last remaining visitor , to leave , I was still absorbed in the charm of computer and the Internet .
it was at that very moment that an ambition popped into my head .
and I determined that I would spend the rest of my life working in the Internet industry .
I don &apos;t know what is on your mind now .
now matter how old we are , perhaps all of us have been forced to abandon some passions due to some practical and social reasons . for example , we had to fo@@ reg@@ o what we loved to do as pupils in order to enter junior high school and when preparing for the Ga@@ ok@@ ao , the National College En@@ trance Ex@@ am , we had to stay highly focused and not to be distracted by our passions .
finally we are in college , with a view to securing a decent job , we often choose to take part in the postgraduate entrance exams at graduation .
after win@@ ing a master degree , we might decide to further our education abroad .
for all the education we have received , social competition is still becoming increasingly fierce .
apart from buying a home , we also want to allow our next generation to live a better life .
I could not help asking this question : &quot; when will we have the luxury of spar@@ ing some time to do what we love ? &quot;
is there no chance for us to stop once we enter the workforce ?
I have believed and I now still believe that it is never to late to learn what we want to learn .
I learned that Xie L@@ un , a guest who delivered a speech yesterday , impressed every audience here .
he said that he was a traveler wishing to travel around the world .
he also loved painting in his childhood , but he has not been able to pursue an art career as a result of various reasons .
however , by the year he was 60 , he started to groom a go@@ ate@@ e and wear a pig@@ tail .
he rocks a pink car@@ dig@@ an that the elderly dare not wear and he ch@@ ases his art dream in his youth .
ten years afterwards , he came to the platform of T@@ n@@ Dao where he shared his story with us .
I think he has great painting skills , or at least with some professionalism .
besides , since he was 70 , he become obsessed with ties between Chinese characters and the world culture .
as a result , he discovered that what our mothers have said has already been guiding the world thousands years ago .
he planned to continue his learning efforts in the next 20 years , so that he will make some achievements when he turns 90 .
as a 70 @-@ year @-@ old man , he spoke of 20 years in such a casual manner .
I believe 20 years are enough .
merely 20 years after the initiation of China &apos;s reform and opening up , many impossible things have turned possible .
opportunities have become available to many children who were not able to learn art before .
learning M@@ ath , Physics and Chemistry is not the only path to a successful career .
there are still some other stories I want to share with you . for instance , I have attracted some special attention from some middle @-@ aged and elderly women , for utterly no particular reason .
some time ago , I came across a women who tried relent@@ lessly to introduce investors to me , saying there were a host of people who would like to pour money into my profitable platform .
I told her that I was not in need of money , and asked her : &quot; what do you really want me to do for you &quot; ? .
she turned out to be a president of a venture capital organization in Shanghai .
she told me when she was young , she wanted to learn English well and she knew she could .
however , the learning was interrupted due to the Cultural Revolution .
afterwards , her English dream was delayed because work consumed much of her time .
following her retirement , she even planned to take part in a English training class .
unfortunately , she also abandoned this plan for the fear that a old woman in her 6@@ 0s might embarr@@ ass her classmates .
right about the time she felt she would never achieve this dream , her daughter gave her a Study Card .
using an anonymous ID , she could say whatever she wanted to say and learn whatever she was interested in , without letting others know that she was a woman in her 6@@ 0s .
sometimes , the teacher even said she had done a fantastic job in her study .
when she announced that she was aged around 60 , everyone was shocked .
she felt really happy because she could finally take off her &quot; mask &quot; and indulge herself in learning English , without any burden .
she could learn whatever she wants and she is doing a great job .
as we all know , the ability of learning varies from people .
some children might not be willing to go to classroom by reason of personality , family and teaching modes of their parents .
some smarter students might think the teacher is giving lessons at a much slow pace , but others with a poorer ability to learn may struggle catching up with the teacher .
with respect to those who can learn faster , we can give them the chance to learn earlier and receive two lessons a day .
for those with a poorer learning ability , they could just learn one lesson in two days .
fortunately , by virtue of the Internet , we can find a way of learning that be@@ fits our unique characters .
this is how we remove our masks and learn in our own ways .
I just wrote off stage that &quot; T@@ n@@ Dao is a good thing . &quot;
what do I want to say is that if you hear something useful in T@@ n@@ Dao , then T@@ n@@ Dao is a good thing .
so , if there is something that you wanted to learn but never did , just do it .
in this short life , if we do not rush to do what we like , we might never have the chance .
thank you for bearing with me .
I H@@ ad a Dream Where You Dre@@ amed of Me .
the title is quite a mouthful . or we can make it even tw@@ is@@ tier , Liu M@@ eng@@ mei had a dream where Du Lin@@ iang Dre@@ amed of Liu M@@ eng@@ mei .
my inspiration of the title comes from an opera I am too familiar with .
as is well known , in The Pe@@ ony Pavilion by Tang Xi@@ an@@ zu , a great writer of the Ming Dynasty , Du Lin@@ iang has an unusual dream .
however , I insist that the dream does not only belong to her .
during the past twenty years of opera training , every time I played in it , Liu M@@ eng@@ mei was the first character to appear on stage , saying that he had a dream where a girl told him they were meant to be together .
it was not unti@@ ll the tenth act did Du Lin@@ iang come out .
she also had a dream in which Liu M@@ eng@@ mei told her they were destined for each other .
I myself found this quite fascinating .
Liu M@@ eng@@ mei dreams Du Lin@@ iang dreams of him .
they actually wander into each other &apos;s dream .
their dreams are so inter@@ twined and romantic that make me wonder how complicated a dream could be .
it is not the dream itself that matters , though .
if Du Lin@@ iang does not pursue the dream , even regardless of her life , there would not be such a touching story in which for love the living can die and the dead can be revived .
so I believe , what really matters is whether you pursue your dream .
as a masterpiece , Pe@@ ony Pavilion has not only given Du a dream and offered us space to perform , but also taught us an attitude towards life .
from my perspective , what matters most is not what I have dreamed of , but what I would do if I had a dream .
I started to learn opera since I was little .
I spent eight years laying groundwork for my dream , and that made all my performance on the stage .
by the way , would you like to see the pictures of our performance in The Pe@@ ony Pavilion ?
the love story is very much romantic , but the oper@@ atic training is not .
it is hard .
how hard ?
you may go watch the movie F@@ are@@ well My Con@@ cub@@ ine by Director Chen Kai@@ ge .
although it is set in the dark days , the experience of us actors is the same .
but because of the painful experience , I have the chance to dream .
I started to dream after years of training .
on October 9 , 2002 , I got the opportunity to perform , with Japanese Kab@@ u@@ ki master I@@ chi@@ k@@ awa E@@ mi@@ ya , the story of a Japanese D@@ ul@@ in@@ iang and a Chinese Liu M@@ eng@@ mei dreaming together .
this is where my dream started , through which I realized that the pursuit of dream could remind us of the past .
we only spent 4 hours on rehearsal .
I was genuinely surprised by his exquisite and superb performance for a Japanese version of Du Lin@@ iang .
I extended my gratitude to Mr. I@@ chi@@ k@@ awa .
he said he was confident that he can act well because , as he put it , China was exactly where they learnt these skills from .
his words enlightened me . indeed , when you get too familiar with something , you will neglect it .
so when we chase your dream , we will recollect what we have left behind , thus learning to respect and restoring our faith in the future .
that was also why I felt so full of strength at the beginning of my pursuit of dream .
what the pursuit of dream gives me even more is the ability to change the present .
in 2008 I was very honored to be invited by Mr. Tan D@@ un to act a special character named Rus@@ ti@@ ch@@ ello in his opera Marco Pol@@ o .
in fact , Rus@@ ti@@ ch@@ ello is the author of the book The Trav@@ els of Marco Pol@@ o .
at the audition , Mr. Tan asked what I was capable of .
I said , &quot; I am a Kun@@ qu Opera actor , I can sing Kun@@ qu . &quot;
I sang a piece of k@@ un@@ qu .
then he asked what else I could perform and my answer was nothing .
at this moment , the junior school@@ mate who went along with me cut in , &quot; He can rap ! &quot;
I said , &quot; No , I can &apos;t . I did rap when I was young , but I dare not rap before a true musician . &quot;
however , Mr. Tan said , &quot; It &apos;s fine , Do a rap . &quot;
then I performed a piece of R@@ ap , which was the only one I could think of .
three months later@@ I received the message that I was chosen .
I was confused of why me , yet I was delight for joining such an international cast .
we were sent to Amsterdam of the Netherlands to rehear@@ se with distinguished opera singers all over the world who speak English .
on the first day , when Mr. Tan introduced me to others , he said that Zhang Jun was an inher@@ itor of Kun@@ qu , an art with 600 years of history , and he had learnt a lot of traditional Kun@@ qu plays including bl@@ a , bl@@ a , bl@@ a , which are so distinctive .
at the end , surprisingly , he asked me to sing a rap song .
I was nervous and embarrassed about r@@ apping before classical opera singers .
but out of respect , I did what I was told .
we had nine performances in Amsterdam , which scored an unprecedented success .
at the celebration in Shanghai , we extended our gratitude to our friends and leaders from the art circles for their support .
I shared everything of this trip to Amsterdam with them .
Mr. Tan also told plenty of funny stories and expressed his thanks for all the help .
then he asked me again to sing a rap song .
I r@@ apped three times .
now I can &apos;t recall what did I rap about . I felt embarrassed .
however , this time , I finally can &apos;t help asking him &quot; Mr. Tan , why did you ask me to rap on such important occasions ? &quot;
he replied , &quot; In fact everyone of us is Marco Pol@@ o . it is openness .
the play is called Marco Pol@@ o , but actually everyone of us is Marco Pol@@ o , in that we all want to disseminate to the western world the eastern arts , cultures and spirits we hold dear .
then , what do you think is the most important thing in the process .
you need an open mind to embrace others &apos; ideas , learn from others and share with others .
only when you open your mind can the others readily accept you .
so Zhang Jun is a Kun@@ qu actor , but he can rap , he &apos;s willing to rap .
the point I want to make is that we artists are open in mind to embrace the world .
this is a spirit we all need most . &quot;
in thinking deeply about it , I realized that this was a strength dream pursuing could bring us , a strength that broadened our mind so as to change everything at the present .
this is just like the first line of the opera .
interestingly , it &apos;s an opera with an English li@@ b@@ ret@@ to and Kun@@ qu @-@ style music , all by Tan D@@ un . the first line goes like this , &quot; As the book of time space opens , there is music suggesting the Peking Opera . &quot;
Peking Opera represents not only itself , but also Kun@@ qu Opera , or a voice from China .
we can change the present and enrich our voices .
and we perform in a unique way .
I believe you must have never heard English words pronounced in this way .
it is the first time on this stage .
it is also the only one of its kind even in Europe .
this is what we are capable of changing when we have gained power from our dream .
for me , I am expecting that the power we gain from our dreams will enable us to create the future .
about two months ago , I gave a particularly important performance on this stage .
its theme was Kun@@ plug , a new style of Kun@@ qu Opera .
those songs from hundreds years ago are renewed with electric instruments , they are enriched with imagination .
I reckon this kind of music to be highly penetrating .
it reminds me back to the Ming Dynasty , when Du Lin@@ iang was dreaming her dreams , when she was singing about the blo@@ oms and grass , thinking to live or to die , there was defin@@ it@@ ly no electricity .
but the electric means today allow us to trace back to where our dreams started and recover our original aspiration .
the name of this music is Jiang E@@ r Shui @-@ All of a Sud@@ den My Heart is Dra@@ wn .
those ways of worship a thousand years ago , those implicit love stories , the most romantic dream Du Lin@@ iang had ever dreamed , remind me that when we make a choice about our dreams , and when we have faith in our inner voices , we can certainly create a completely different future .
can I ask you a question ?
is there anything in common between the two girls who look dramatically different from each other ?
please think about it .
any idea ?
let me tell you , what they have most in common is that both of them wish to improve their looks through plastic surgery .
it &apos;s easy to understand the beauty needs of the second girl .
this girl is one of my patients .
she is 16 years old , a native of Chang@@ xing County , Zhejiang Province .
her family runs a small hand weaving workshop .
one day when she was 12 , after washing her hair , she played on the open ground next to a loom .
suddenly she felt a stom@@ ach@@ ache and crou@@ ched down to press her belly .
a tragedy happened at the instant when she squ@@ at@@ ted .
her long hair was caught in the working loom .
hearing her screaming , her mother ran out and turned off the loom , but it was too late .
the loom had pulled off her entire scalp and the upper and lower eyelids on the left side of her face .
I still clearly remember when she was send to the emergency room of Shanghai Ninth People &apos;s Hospital four years ago .
her left eye@@ ball and the whole skull were skin@@ less and bloody , so appalling that one could hardly bear the sight of it .
we gave her emergency treatment and multiple touch @-@ up sur@@ ger@@ ies , but as you can see from this photo I took two days ago , we still fail to give her a head of hair and restore her eyelids .
for this girl , cosmetic surgery is a real bo@@ on and a must .
it is the greatest wish of her and her family to restore her appearance to its pre @-@ injury state .
then , let &apos;s take a look at the first girl .
you may think plastic surgery is unnecessary for her because she is quite pretty .
but I &apos;m telling you , not only did she have plastic surgery , it also cost her life .
her name is Wang Bei .
some of you who are familiar with the TV program Super Girl or plastic surgery may know her story .
two years ago , when she was going through a mandi@@ bular angle splitting oste@@ otomy at a plastic surgery hospital in Wuhan , she died of airway obstruction of respiratory tract at the age of 24 .
this is an extreme case , of course .
but for beauty seekers like Wang Bei , cosmetic surgery , something that should have made them more beautiful , unexpectedly took their lives .
was it worth it ?
here , by telling the stories of these two girls , I want to share some of my thoughts from them .
for star@@ ters , should we pursue beauty throughout our lifetime ?
given the risks and costs , how far should we go in our pursuit of beauty ?
what should we do to ensure that the cosmetic surgery is an icing on the cake , that it brings positive and meaningful changes to our looks and lives ?
and one more question . a fundamental one .
what is beauty ?
first , I believe that health is the premise of beauty .
you can see there is a pair of breasts .
they are plump , per@@ ky and beautiful !
but if I tell you that there are lots of time bombs and dangerous goods buried in this pair of breasts , do you still think they are beautiful ?
yes , there is Amaz@@ ing@@ el in them .
this girl is a victim of a breast aug@@ mentation by injected Amaz@@ ing@@ el .
she received the breast aug@@ mentation surgery in a beauty institution without being well informed about Amaz@@ ing@@ el .
having known the toxic side effects of Amaz@@ ing@@ el later , she turned to us to take it out from her breasts .
what &apos;s in the bowl is the Amaz@@ ing@@ el we took out from her on our operating table .
but unfortunately , the modern technologies and methods can never remove Amaz@@ ing@@ el completely , and the residual gel in her body is like a ticking bomb that we don &apos;t know when or how it will explode .
so here , as cosmetic injection is growing in popularity , I want to say something to those who wish they were more beautiful .
please remember two things .
firstly , please choose regular medical institutions whenever you seek cosmetic treatment .
and be careful with any bar@@ ber@@ shop or irregular individual workshop that tells you that they can offer beauty services .
it &apos;s much easier to inject something into our body than taking it out .
secondly , please be sure to know what injections you are taking , and to keep their bar@@ codes and product numbers .
only in this way can we protect ourselves and make ourselves healthy and beautiful .
then , I believe that the true beauty is not only about your ap@@ per@@ ance , but also your internal cultivation .
definitely , cosmetic surgery is a way to improve our looks in a very short period of time , but our inner world , thoughts and selves are hard to be upgraded by a plastic surgery overnight .
when doing clinic hours , I have met patients of all kinds , of which young girls contributed the largest proportion , including students , young white col@@ lars , country girls working in cities , and NE@@ ET group .
I can almost tell what they do for a living at first glance from what they dress and how they talk .
most of them did have a correct understanding of their beauty needs and their appearance , but some were not .
I have a story for you , a few days ago , maybe two weeks from now , I had a patient who looked very young , probably under twenty .
she came into my consulting room and said , &quot; Doctor , I want to fix my nose . &quot;
I looked at her nose and asked her , &quot; which part of your nose do you think that need to be fixed ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know , all my girl@@ friends think my nose is ugly . &quot;
then I asked her , &quot; What kind of nose do you want ? &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . whatever looks better than it does now . &quot;
from a professional perspective , I analyzed the im@@ perfec@@ tions of her nose and offered three solutions .
I told her to choose one from the three plans according to her expectation .
she was still puzzled but with determination and longing for this surgery , she finally made a choice with the help of her friends .
later , on the day of the surgery , she was lying on the operating table .
I chat@@ ted with her and found out that she came to Shanghai just to have this plastic surgery .
then I asked her , &quot; Did your parents know why you came to Shanghai ? &quot;
she answered , &quot; No , they didn &apos;t . &quot;
I kept asking , &quot; Who gave you the money for the surgery ? &quot;
&quot; I borrowed it from my friends , &quot; she said .
my heart sank when I heard that , to be frank , I wouldn &apos;t have agreed to operate on her if I had known that .
I really wanted to tell the girl that rather than borrowing money for plastic surgery , she might as well spend one percent of the surgery fee on a good book .
I truly believe that for a girl , the wisdom and beauty gained from learning tr@@ ump what a beautiful nose brings to her .
a part from young wom@@ ens , among my out@@ patients , middle @-@ aged women account for a larger share .
they are richer than younger girls and are more willing to pay for youth and beauty .
although most of them maintain a healthy attitude , there are also some who want to solve problems in their life through surgery .
the most common example is that when there are marriage crisis and family issues , they expect to save their marriage and family by improving their looks through plastic surgery .
here is an extreme case I had .
five years ago , I received a half @-@ aged couple in their fif@@ ties .
upon entering my office , the wife said , &quot; Doctor , I want a vag@@ in@@ o@@ plasty . &quot;
before I could say anything , the husband said hastily , &quot; Doctor , don &apos;t listen to her ! &quot;
I looked at them , confused .
then the husband said to his wife , &quot; You don &apos;t have to do it . I cheated on you just for the sex . I will give you all the money and I also want to keep our family intact . &quot;
the wife exclaimed , &quot; No ! I don &apos;t want you to have the other woman . &quot;
I was totally shocked .
I could not believe that this couple was actually fighting like this in front of me .
I didn &apos;t know how to help them .
technically , I could do a surgery on that wife .
no problem at all .
but I doubted that I could save her marriage with just one surgery ？
will this surgery stop the husband from cheating ?
so , for middle @-@ aged women with marital or family problems , it is far more important to figure out the reasons that cause such problems than worrying about their appearance .
my last message for you is that diversity is essential to beauty .
my patients often show me some celebrities &quot; photos and say , &quot; Doctor , I want a nose like hers &quot; and &quot; Doctor , I want my chin to be like hers . &quot;
they even say , &quot; Doctor , I want a face like Fan Bing@@ bing &apos;s . &quot;
whether they have the regular features to change into Fan Bing@@ bing aside , our world will definitely be a dull and boring place if the streets are full of beau@@ ties who look like Fan Bing@@ bing .
it is our different physical appearances that make our world colorful , interesting and fascinating .
if you are a plum , then don &apos;t dream of becoming a peach .
if you insist on changing yourself from a plum to a peach , you may become a bitter peach .
so we should strive to be the most delicious and attractive plum , not a bitter peach , and plastic surgery can help us achieve that .
I am willing to create more beautiful and attractive pe@@ aches and pl@@ ums with my hands , my scal@@ p@@ els , and my skills .
and I hope that all of us can always pay equal attention to internal and external beauty when we &apos;re pursuing the true meaning of life .
each of us can be a plum , peach or orange with tempting appearance and unique taste .
thank you all !
recently , I was busy with a play called Tu@@ es@@ days with Mor@@ rie .
I went on tour from Taiwan to Shanghai with the play for almost one year .
now I want to share with you my feelings about something interesting occu@@ red during the tour .
this is a theatrical adap@@ tion of a true story named Tu@@ es@@ days with Mor@@ rie .
the book was published in different countries around the world .
I bet many of you have heard of it or even read it .
the book was based on the story of an old professor who suffered from A@@ my@@ otrop@@ hic L@@ ateral S@@ clerosis , an incur@@ able disease and had only a few times left to live .
one of his students visited him every Tuesday for 14 times .
on the 14th visit which turned out to be the last , the professor passed away in his last lesson .
throughout the play , it was very quiet on the stage for there were only two actors , star@@ ring as the professor and his student .
the plot is not complicated nor dramatic , just some talks about different topics , including death .
since the play goes on with few dramatic conflicts , the reaction of the audience seemed interesting .
the audience seemed to become some invisible on@@ loo@@ kers , standing by the sick@@ bed of the dying professor , listening to his 14 lessons and watched his journey to death .
during the play , we could hear some so@@ b@@ b@@ ings in the audience from time to time .
when I was acting , I would glance at the audience sometimes .
I often found people rubbing their eyes with handker@@ chiefs or tissue papers , as there were many heart @-@ breaking moments in the play .
but do you know what interested me most ?
what interested me most was that I heard laughter every now and then from the audience in such a sad story .
I am really curious about the laughter .
maybe it was because the story was actually somewhat interesting , for the old professor had a good sense of humor , he talked in refined way and held special stand@@ points about life .
so it was expected to hear some laughter during the play after we went through rehearsal .
however , considering that the scene was after all about the ward of a terminal patient lying on the bed .
all the audience witnessed the old man being tortured by the illness and struggling for the last breath .
wasn &apos;t it weird yet inte@@ res@@ eting to laugh at such a scene ?
in China &apos;s conservative tradition , if you laugh out before a dying elder surrounded by other visitors , you will get criticized and feel guilty about yourself .
people would say , &quot; Are you insane ? are you crazy ? why are you so impolite ? how dis@@ respectful you are ! how can you show no respect to elders ? &quot;
but the audience couldn &apos;t stop their sincere laugh in the play .
I liked their laugh because I sensed an interesting mentality behind it .
what was that exactly ?
an audience commented after the play that he had not expected to laugh now and then throughout a death @-@ them@@ ed play while crying .
it was a wonderful experience for him .
when he left the theater , he felt a strength that encouraged him to face his life and live .
that was his understanding .
how do I interpret the laugh of the whole audience then ?
for me , it &apos;s a kind of relief .
the relief from what ?
from their fear of death , the fear people get in front of the death .
actually it &apos;s more than just relief and there is something more significant in it .
that is courage .
why ?
because you are not afraid to be there with a close relative or friend in their last moments when their body starts to turn cold .
you are willing to cope with their deaths in a natural , sincere and considerate manner and show your passion for life .
this is my interpretation of the laugh .
by the way , let me share with you a personal story in my life .
a good friend of mine in Taipei was engaged in music business and had cooperated with me for several times in play all these years .
he was someone wild and with a strong personality .
whenever he spoke , he would come out with the most extraordinary remarks with a sense of humor and in a loud voice , he always impressed people with his remarks .
he was someone like that , we worked together a year ago for a play , after which I didn &apos;t hear from him .
one day , I received a sudden call from his family .
I was told that he had developed terminal lung cancer and he had few days left .
shocked at the news , I hurried to call other friends to visit him in hospital together .
the moment we stood before his sick@@ bed , we were all pe@@ tri@@ fied .
he was virtually a bag of bones with sunken cheeks and eye orbits .
he had dull eyes and long , messy be@@ ards and hair .
we surrounded him for quite a while , speechless .
standing there we were somewhat nervous and scared , no one said a word .
we rac@@ ked our brain for the appropriate comforting words but held back the tongue , we recalled the doctors &apos; words that there were few days left but what words could be appropriate in circumstances like this .
what could we say then ?
it felt like whatever we said would seem inappropriate .
but we also couldn &apos;t stand there like that all the time , so we broke the silence and talk frivol@@ ously like &quot; Does it hurt ? , &quot; &quot; Today is really windy , &quot; &quot; We got here by public transport . it was so crowded and uncomfortable , bl@@ ah bl@@ ah bl@@ ah . &quot;
each of us said something , with a long pause each time .
we hum@@ bled for the words .
lying in bed , he said nothing during the whole time and he just shook his head fee@@ bly and repeatedly , which was the only thing he could do .
in the end , I blur@@ ted out something even more ridiculous out of the blue , &quot; Hey , buddy , you can star as Jesus now . &quot;
that made him laugh .
we were laughing too , in an exaggerated way , because it was not funny at all .
I had no idea why we laughed for a long time un@@ naturally .
we just laughed .
after that there were no more boring remarks , for the visiting time was short and he was too sick .
therefore we hurried off .
on my way home , I was proud of that un@@ funny joke and pleased to see all my friends laugh .
that feeling ling@@ ered on . when I bowed and bid farewell to my friend in the mor@@ tuary house and on his funeral a couple of days after the visit and when I recalled him later at any time 。
I think to myself , &quot; B@@ ro , we almost got scared by death . fortunately , we didn &apos;t . it was because we could , we were able to and we dared to laugh before the death . we testified with laugh that we were still who we were and would not be defeated by death . &quot;
why I can &apos;t forget the laugh ?
what I think over all the time is the laugh in the hospital and the laugh of the audience in the theater .
the answer is simple .
say , you are going off somewhere far away , and I come to see you off .
what do you expect to get , whether you are in a train station , an airport or even an intensive care unit ?
do you want me to shed tears or cry my heart out ?
is that all ?
I don &apos;t think so .
suppose we are close , you don &apos;t want to see me just crying , do you ?
such as some encour@@ ag@@ ements , good wishes , ch@@ itch@@ at , funny stories , jokes or even a song .
there are different possible ways than just crying .
however , crying is probably the only thing we could do due to our conservative tradition and the society .
if you come to see me off when I leave , I will assure you that the last thing I want to see is you crying .
because I will be worried about you and can &apos;t go far away .
my speech is coming to the end .
before that , I want to quote again from the play Tu@@ es@@ days with Mor@@ rie .
actually it &apos;s my first line in the play .
right after the graduation ceremony at one university , a student of mine , who was very shy and poor at expressing himself , looked around to check his surroundings and found it was clear , so he lowered his head and prepared to sneak away .
but I caught him right on the scene .
&quot; hey , where are you going , kid ? do you really think you can get out steal@@ th@@ ily of the place where you stayed for four years without saying anything ? &quot; I asked .
he fal@@ tered , &quot; Oh , professor , actually , I don &apos;t know how to say goodbye . &quot;
well , that &apos;s a dreadful question since human beings came to the world .
it makes us cr@@ inge to say goodbye .
but there are many occasions we need to wave goodbye and the most serious one is death .
on hearing the student &apos;s answer , I did nothing but held him tightly in my arms , saying &quot; This is goodbye . &quot;
it can be a hug .
just a hug .
it actually means love .
sometimes , we can express our love through a simple action .
for example , when we are in front of a dying relative , or even before a cold corpse , a simple action like a hug , a touch , cheek to cheek , a kiss , or a smile can show our love .
however , if we dare not to do that and we just cry , grieve , feel at loss and finally sink into silence then the life will really be pathetic .
that is all .
thank you .
I &apos;ve wished I could walk onto the stage like a model .
but finally I had to be wheeled up here , and see a world almost one meter lower than I wished for .
that is indeed a regret .
when I was a little girl , I used to care a lot about how I looked .
every mirror I passed could testify that .
not merely mirrors , but anything that can reflect , would make me stay .
I loved dressing up and enjoyed being the center of attention . and I was very sensitive .
the performances on the stage , with dry @-@ ice fog and spot@@ lights all around them , would always exhilar@@ ate me .
I felt as if I myself were the elf in the spotlight .
what a great thing it would be , I remember I was thinking , to grab people &apos;s attention and be ad@@ ored .
then two little incidents be@@ fell me as a young girl , leaving me some regrets .
both were related to the stage .
one incident happened when I was twelve .
we , our class , were rehear@@ sing a dance named &quot; A Little Girl Who Is be@@ ach@@ comb@@ ing , &quot; for a new @-@ year celebration on the campus .
and I was in the performance team .
but one day during the rehearsal , I suddenly found that I could not squ@@ at completely down .
and things were soon getting worse .
whatever effort I made to rectify , I just couldn &apos;t do it .
then the teacher saw it .
she tried to help correct my posture , but failed .
and for the sake of the whole class , I had to be discharged .
the performance turned out to be a hit , winning a th@@ undering applause .
my classmates stood bas@@ h@@ fully on the stage , answering their curtain call , while I hid myself in the smo@@ thering crowds off the stage , and clapped mechanically .
another thing happened when I was seventeen .
there was an English sketch comedy competition in our school .
our class planned to act out M@@ au@@ pass@@ ant &apos;s work The Nec@@ k@@ lace .
and I was chosen to audition for the heroine - the vain but lovely and honest Madame M@@ ath@@ il@@ de Lo@@ is@@ el .
each student would have their chance in the preliminary selection .
when the selection began , I thought I did a great job .
I even imagined myself as Isab@@ elle Ad@@ j@@ ani , my favorite French actress .
there were two judges : the representative of English lesson in our class , and our English teacher .
the representative chose me , but our English teacher just looked at me and said , &quot; Oh Ding Ming ? forget about it . &quot;
there was a reason , for I had already begun to wob@@ ble when I walked , though I had not used a wheelchair , like now .
the teacher might think I would spoil the whole appearance of the class during the performance .
and of course she was right .
how can the beautiful M@@ ath@@ il@@ de be played by someone who lim@@ ps ?
my dream of becoming a performer was thus killed by my illness .
an illness which later revealed itself as amy@@ otrop@@ hic lateral s@@ clerosis .
it stripped me of the ability to move at my will and to breathe with ease .
within a short time , the things I couldn &apos;t hold tightly extended from a basin of water , to a bowl , a telephone and even a cup .
regrets kept coming un@@ solicited , for example , when I was wr@@ inging out a wet towel , I was supposed to use both hands .
but since I had to hold the table for balance , I could spare only one hand for the job .
such regrets went on and on in my life .
at that time I told myself that , it &apos;d be ok if I couldn &apos;t become a performer .
I could make myself a loyal spectator instead .
years ago I had a chance to watch Mr. Zhang Jun &apos;s exquisite performance as Liu M@@ eng@@ mei , the hero in Tang Xi@@ an@@ zu &apos;s play &quot; The Pe@@ ony Pavilion . &quot;
I had a very good time there off the stage watching it .
that , I think , might count as a psychic compensation for me .
as time went on , I felt that regrets just came endlessly one after another .
I remember a colleague of mine once jo@@ ked , &quot; You &apos;ve got a most powerful green pass : the disability certificate issued by the People &apos;s Republic of China . and you should know that sometimes it is even better at helping you get your own way than an elite university &apos;s doctor &apos;s degree . &quot;
that might be true .
but for a person like me who always cher@@ ishes dreams , the missing diploma is somehow a constant pain .
I remember the first time I encountered a university was when I went to a Q@@ ig@@ ong presentation , which was supposed to work for my illness , in an auditorium of a university .
it was a quiet night .
on my arrival I was greeted with the aroma of foliage , the street lamps , and the light filtering through the windows of the teaching buildings , all feeling beautifully like knowledge .
all seemed to be summon@@ ing a soul that had once missed out on a university - me .
it remained a pity that I had never become a member of a university .
but I soon found a way to make up for it - to learn on my own .
if there was no teacher , no vi@@ be , it wouldn &apos;t matter . I would create a vi@@ be by myself .
then I threw myself into industrious reading .
it was easy then , not like today ,
when internet might rob us of attention on reading .
for a long time after that I just kept reading and reading .
I found strength in the books , and became more outgoing .
books gave me both internal and external nutrition .
a few years ago , my book written based on my own experience , 27@@ 0,000 characters in length , was published . it was finished within ten months .
without years of experience of reading , I would never have been able to complete the book .
so regrets somehow can also lead to something good .
there is another regret , which occurred later , that I want to talk about .
I was already over twenty years old .
young girls that age always have some romantic pursuits , but in that respect my life was completely blank .
I remember hearing a girl born in 1989 mo@@ an a few days ago , &quot; Gos@@ h , I am such a left @-@ over woman . &quot;
and I thought , you were born in 1989 and you are already a left @-@ over woman , then where should I - a woman born in 1976 - go ?
you can understand that , right ?
later I read some articles on the newspaper , which even placed unmarried women into down@@ grading categories , and each category was mock@@ ingly named .
I felt bad for myself , for this year is my year of birth and I almost had turned 37 .
according to their standards , I must be the most piti@@ able left @-@ over woman , ha @-@ ha @-@ ha .
so sometimes I will feel a little disturbed , and also lonely .
but the plus side of my single life is that I share a strong bond with my parents .
I can feel their love for me , and also make them happy .
speaking of &quot; making parents happy , &quot; I feel relieved to find my father absent today , for if he hears this phrase , he must be gripped by bitter memories .
I was really such a trouble for him , for I was terribly head@@ strong .
speaking of my parents , there is one thing I feel especially sorry about : I lack patience with them .
and there is another thing I feel more ashamed about : I often ignore what they do for me .
parental love must be the most touching of all aff@@ ections .
take my father for example .
nine years ago he had a kidney removed because of cancer .
I still remember that win@@ try night , when he had just had his operation , I was being wheeled home by an hourly worker .
and suddenly I saw an old man wrapped in a down jacket walking up and down before the two iron gates of our community .
it was my father .
I asked him , in a blunt manner , &quot; What are you doing here ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; I came down to fetch you home , &quot; with a shy , expecting smile .
a lump suddenly came into my throat , for not long before this , his emotional turbulence caused by male menopause had been causing a lot of trouble in the house .
I had felt that he failed me .
he was totally not the talented , omni@@ potent father in my memory .
yet on such a win@@ try night , this man , completely ignoring the doctor &apos;s instructions for him to rest in bed , chose to stand in the icy wind , awaiting his def@@ ying , conce@@ ited daughter , like an old bird longing for the return of its kids .
and I won &apos;t forget my mother , who pays me all her attention to discern my feelings , endure my tan@@ tr@@ ums , and satisfy all my needs , however challenging they are .
I still remember once , about a dozen years ago , I terribly wanted a set of the collected works of Charles Dickens .
and of course it was not for showing off . I really wanted to read the books .
but the bookstore had already sold out all the copies , and there was not an online store to turn to . that was a dozen years ago , you should know .
then my mother decided to buy the books from the publisher , which was very far away from our house .
on her way back , she found that the large box containing 19 volumes of Charles Dickens was impossible to carry .
so she placed the box down on the ground , kicked it , and thus moved it inch by inch , until she got home .
but she told me nothing about it , until several years later , during a TV interview , when the host asked about my habit of reading , she revealed the truth , in a light @-@ hearted and humorous tone .
it was at that moment that I finally realized that parents were the most important part of my life .
I was also thinking that , though I couldn &apos;t live my life like a normal person , I still could light up my world with my heart and create wonders that only belong to me .
regrets are always about loss .
however , a truly mature soul should be philosophical about anything he or she owns or loses , and thus feel no regrets .
the other day I was staying with some friends . we talked about family background , appearance and wisdom .
the three aspects , I guess , are the major causes of regrets for the ordinary people , particularly women .
one friend complained to me that she envi@@ ed those who had high @-@ ranking officials , rich men , stars or any lumin@@ aries as parents , for her own parents were really mediocre and could not give her good resources .
while others had got head starts , she could only tr@@ udge her way far behind .
and I said , &quot; Y@@ ours is not so bad actually . just think , some people might have to climb out of a mountain cave , and some might never have a chance to leave their cellar . &quot;
what I meant was the sense of satisfaction .
another friend believed that she looked too plain , and she admired the life of those beautiful ones .
I told her that appearance was actually not so important .
there were also friends who told me their regrets and complaints about not having this or that .
here I &apos;d like to share with you a passage I saw once re@@ posted on the T@@ n@@ Dao forum , which approximately den@@ otes that those ascri@@ bing their failure to attain or create excellent works to the restraining systems , could not , even if situated in Swiss , liberate their souls .
those blaming marriage for binding them and killing their dreams , could not , even when they are single , become Madame Cur@@ ie .
that &apos;s it .
we are all living in the same age , where hardships and regrets are never uncommon .
but when looking out of the window at the world outside , some see the mirror , some see the beautiful scenery beyond , and some only see the darkness lur@@ king there .
it is the same with regrets .
I recall something funny that happened on the bus when I was a kid . and here I &apos;m happy to share it with you .
I was eating a hot , big and tasty Bao@@ zi on the bus .
my routine of eating Bao@@ zi then was always to leave the best part to the last moment .
can you understand ?
I mean I would usually eat the skin first and leave the filling inside intact .
so I was eating my Bao@@ zi , watching the skin gradually pe@@ eling off , as I sat there sm@@ ugly looking at the scenery outside .
the meat filling inside the Bao@@ zi was emerging , bigger and bigger in size . I was full of expectation and tried to handle the last bit of skin with care .
the holy , crow@@ ning moment is coming , I told myself , and be prepared for an extreme satisfaction .
the bus suddenly stopped short .
the bus driver must be a big bully .
you should know I was only five or six years old then .
then the meat filling of my Bao@@ zi just shot away like a ping @-@ pong ball , rolling on the ground for a while and got coated with dust .
that w@@ renched an excl@@ amation out of me , &quot; O@@ ops ! such a big regret ! &quot;
passengers on the bus were startled .
they never thought a five @-@ or @-@ six @-@ year @-@ old could use the word &quot; regret . &quot;
that was also the first time I used the word myself .
now when I recall this funny experience , I am thinking that , maybe my life looks just like the skin of a Bao@@ zi . but that never means it is not a Bao@@ zi .
though I indeed missed the meat filling .
regrets are just like that meat filling . what does that mean ?
the meat filling symbolizes the regrets and the things implied by the regrets . though by a stroke of bad luck I couldn &apos;t taste the meat filling , but I had already smelled it when I was eating the skin , and tasted it when I was sucking in the meat grav@@ y .
I wonder whether the meat filling , if I really rel@@ ished it as I intended to , could have given me more satisfaction .
so it is with our life .
the process and experience of living might be the most valuable part .
there was a bright side in my story . only when I lost my chance to eat the meat filling could I sav@@ or the skin to the utmost .
I would never have enjoyed the taste of skin and flavor of flour like that before .
that is life .
as for myself , my regrets are linked with my special physical condition .
and it is because of my special condition that I have won a lot of attention and support , as well as more tolerance of my way@@ wardness .
I have also received help from different corners of the society .
and my ties with T@@ n@@ Dao first began because some kind @-@ hearted people and enterprises , who funded a traditional Chinese medicine institution , wanted to do research and treat my illness .
we are still trying , and perhaps one day I can really walk on to this stage like a model .
and if I can &apos;t , that &apos;ll also be fine .
why ?
because I believe , whatever I look like , nothing will stop me smiling my chu@@ bby smile and posing gorge@@ ously on this wheelchair .
once at school , I lost my chance to perform on the stage .
but today , I manage to speak here on an even larger stage , and share with you my thoughts , my dreams and my strength . I &apos;m in command of the room .
eating only the skin of Bao@@ zi is not so bad after all .
but next time I eat a Bao@@ zi , I &apos;ll try to bite off the meat filling first . won &apos;t it be better to never let regrets happen ?
thank you !
recently people keep asking me , &quot; Why did you quit your job as a journalist and choose to join in the &apos; Ve@@ ter@@ ans Re@@ turning Home &apos; charity campaign ? &quot;
I would tell them a story about a veteran .
his name is Dong Zha@@ oc@@ hao , who was left behind on the border of Yunnan after the War of Resistance Against Japan and was thus separated from his family for over half a century .
when I learned this , I couldn &apos;t help thinking about how I should help him find his family .
a lot of ideas popped into my head .
things had been delayed for too long , though .
only after almost one year did I finally find Dong Zha@@ oc@@ hao &apos;s family .
I remember I was so happy .
then I set out for Yunnan and planned to bring the poor veteran home .
only to learn on my arrival that he had passed away three months ago .
a tw@@ inge of remorse struck me .
I felt it was me who was to blame for denying the poor veteran of his last chance to re@@ unite with his family .
then I quit my job last May , so I could throw myself wholeheartedly into this campaign .
the part of history involved here , perhaps , is still un@@ k@@ own to you .
at that time , the Pacific War had broken out . China , Britain and US came together to form the Chinese Ex@@ pedi@@ tionary Force .
the Japanese army had already seized Yang@@ on , Myanmar &apos;s capital .
that intensely threatened the home front of the Chinese army .
and what &apos;s worse , the Burma Road which China used to transport strategic materials was cut off .
Chinese Ex@@ pedi@@ tionary Force
I am now even thinking of it as a very rare coincidence .
it was on this very day seventy years ago that ten thousand soldiers of the Chinese Ex@@ pedi@@ tionary Force departed from the Port of W@@ anding , Yunnan , to shed blood on a foreign land .
they lost their first battle in Myanmar .
the &quot; Clim@@ b over the Nag@@ a Hills , &quot; as might be known to all , was actually a retreat of the force into the mountains after their first defeat .
lots of people died and were buried there in the endless primitive forests .
over a year later , the Chinese Army in India and the Western Yunnan Ex@@ pedi@@ tionary Force launched a counter offense .
the Chinese Ex@@ pedi@@ tionary Force finally won the battle , at the cost of nearly 200 thousand casu@@ alities .
seventy years on , at times I find myself in a cho@@ king sadness .
those Chinese soldiers wrote a grand history with their life and blood , only to be left out by history .
this veteran is Yang Ji@@ anda .
he was in Myanmar &apos;s My@@ it@@ k@@ y@@ ina , away from his hometown M@@ ei@@ xian District , M@@ ai@@ zhou City , Guangdong .
we helped him find his family .
but when we went to bring him home last August , his legs had been disabled .
our volunteers carried him home .
the entire process ev@@ oked a lot of compassionate sigh@@ s .
we had arranged ceremonies , in the hope of showing our respect for the veterans through all those minute details .
we asked the plane captain to specially introduce this honored guest on board .
we lit firecr@@ ackers at his hometown .
and we had the border guards render a military hand salute at him .
our only wish as we were doing this was to dissolve all the bitter feelings those veterans had har@@ bored over those fifty @-@ odd years .
Yang Ji@@ anda , if you have seen related reports , you must have known that he sang a song named My Home is on Son@@ ghua River in the Northeast , a song that would even have touched a hardened heart .
it was the song that his troops ch@@ anted as they marched into a foreign battlefield , and also a song that voiced their longing .
when would they be able to go back home ?
and when to see their parents again ?
Yang Ji@@ anda , I remember , after a family visit to his hometown , returned to Myanmar again , for he has his own family to care about there .
on the night of a September 17th , before his sleep , Yang Ji@@ anda began to sing the song My home is on Son@@ ghua River in the Northeast .
his daughter Ling@@ ling asked , &quot; Dad , are you dre@@ ami@@ g ? &quot;
and Yang Ji@@ anda answered , &quot; No , I am not dreaming . I sang the song because tomorrow is September 18th . &quot;
how many people still remember this day ?
and how many people still know this song ?
a young friend asked me on the micro@@ blog , &quot; Yang Ji@@ anda &apos;s hometown is not in the Northeast of China , but why was he singing that song ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t blame the young friend for his ignorance , because our ties with that part of history have been politically sev@@ ered .
the purpose of the &quot; Ve@@ ter@@ ans Re@@ turning Home &quot; campaign is to enable each veteran , each soldier that once fought for our country on foreign lands , to return in triumph .
we are not only giving them financial support , but moreover , an honor .
four years into this campaign , already over 30 veterans from Myanmar , Thailand , Vietnam and the border of Yunnan have went back home and re@@ united with their family , from whom they had been separated for nearly seventy years .
I &apos;ve been to Myanmar a dozen times . during my work helping veterans go home , I &apos;ve experienced very complicated feelings .
this is S@@ ag@@ a@@ ing Region in Myanmar .
here Japan has built a memorial pag@@ oda .
on its base we can see all the dead Japanese soldiers &apos; names carved .
such memorial pag@@ od@@ as are very common in Myanmar .
almost every used @-@ to @-@ be battlefield here hosts a Japanese memorial building .
some Japanese monuments even include the war@@ horses .
this is a British cemetery located in Yang@@ on .
it presents a very beautiful sight .
there are more than 5000 tombs .
a very nice place it is .
the British troops used to be our allies on the Myan@@ m@@ ese battlefield .
we sc@@ oured the entire Myanmar , and found only one tom@@ b@@ stone , or more exactly , a half , of the Chinese Ex@@ pedi@@ tionary Force .
nearly 100 thousand soldiers of the Chinese Ex@@ pedi@@ tionary Force sacrificed in Myanmar , yet among the 10 @-@ odd Chinese ceme@@ teries , none survived .
some gave way to houses .
some to schools .
the only half tom@@ b@@ stone we found belonged to a cemetery for Sun Li@@ ren &apos;s New 3@@ 8th Division of the National Rev@@ olutionary Army .
standing before the tomb , I was not sure whether I should feel lucky , or wo@@ eful .
the wo@@ eful side was that , only one tomb was left for the 100 thousand soldiers of the Chinese Ex@@ pedi@@ tionary Force .
there was not even a place where they could rest in peace .
the lucky side was that we finally came across a place where we could kne@@ el down .
this is the British cemetery I earlier mentioned .
last March , I , along with five companions , paid it a visit .
the cemetery administrator , Oscar , greeted us .
this cemetery was under the charge of Commonwealth War Gr@@ aves Commission , which supervised all of Britain &apos;s war graves in foreign countries .
I went to the website and found its mission was to let each of the dead be commemor@@ ated by name on the head@@ stone or memorial .
as the six of us entered the cemetery , Oscar noticed us immediately and said hello , then he asked , &quot; Are you from Japan or South Korea ? &quot;
I told him we were Chinese .
he then asked , &quot; From Taiwan ? &quot;
I said , &quot; No . we are from Beijing . &quot;
he pursued , &quot; Are you here for oil or lumber business ? &quot;
I felt deeply ashamed hearing this question .
then we expressed our intention : to find the veterans .
that surprised him a lot , and he explained , &quot; I &apos;ve been here for over 20 years , and it is the first time that I have seen Chinese people searching for veterans . &quot;
then Oscar led the way and helped us find over 30 head@@ stones on which was written &quot; China . &quot;
the sight largely embarrassed us , and Oscar was a cruel critic when he asked us , &quot; Do you Chinese people all have a bad memory ? &quot;
here were buried British native soldiers , he said , along with mercenaries from Myanmar , India and Africa .
&quot; I have seen relatives from all the places above come here , but why have I never met a Chinese ? &quot;
in Myanmar I would repeatedly ask a question , for example , when checking into a hotel , I would ask the hotel keeper , &quot; Which country , foreign country , are most of your guests from ? &quot;
the answer was almost always the same : China and Japan .
and every time , this other person I talked to would immediately added , even before I hinted , that the Japanese were here to commemorate their ancestors , while the Chinese were here for business .
last September 18th , I opened the homepage of S@@ ina , whose headline was about advocating a serious commemoration of the day and never for@@ ge@@ ting the national humiliation .
under the headline was a news article , saying that in Chongqing , half of the ruins of the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War had vanished and been replaced by construction sites .
it is perfect sarcas@@ m .
that , is how we remember the national humiliation .
the real remembrance of the national humiliation , for me , must include the care about those surviving veterans , the supreme national reverence for the dead , and the de @-@ politici@@ zation of historical narr@@ atives .
notable progress has been actually made in this area , in dealing with this part of history .
in 2005 , the then President Hu Jintao in a public speech mentioned the contribution of the National Army in the front@@ line battlefield of the War of Resistance Against Japan .
in 2005 , the veterans of the War of Resistance Against Japan were awarded the 60 Years of Chinese People &apos;s Anti @-@ Japanese War Vic@@ tory Medal .
the medal was jointly issued by the CPC Central Committee , the State Council and the Central Military Commission of China . it was a national honor .
however , lots of , or even almost all of the veterans of the Republic of China Armed Forces , were excluded , except a very tiny fraction of them .
many veterans saw the national honor as something of enormous meaning .
a veteran that once fought in Myanmar told me : we do not fear death . we only fear obli@@ vi@@ on .
the veterans came to me and asked if I could help them get a medal .
I then did a lot of communication work , but failed .
one day a friend of mine from Shanghai told me in an excited tone that he saw the medal being sold on Ta@@ obao .
I was thrilled and immediately ordered some medals on Ta@@ obao .
and my friend bought all of the four left .
but when I saw the medals for real , I felt ashamed .
I began to doubt whether the medals bought from Ta@@ obao could truly represent this country .
in my eyes , to buy these medals on Ta@@ obao was to tar@@ nish the national honor , as well as those veterans &apos; loyalty to the country .
so I never sent out the medals .
I keep thinking that the spirit of a country must stem from a respect for life , for every single life .
let the veterans go home .
let the surviving heroes go home .
let the wandering souls of the dead go home .
and let the history crafted by the blood and life of Chinese soldiers go home .
well , this morning at breakfast , an elderly waitress serve me with a you@@ ti@@ ao and a C@@ ong you bing in a bowl .
seeing the food , my first reaction was to ask her , &quot; Are they made out of g@@ utter oil ?
she said , &quot; No , the cooking oil we use came in boxes . &quot;
I asked , &quot; What kind of boxes ? &quot;
she then didn &apos;t know how to describe .
sometimes , I do believe that language can be misleading .
when I was interviewed by the producer and director of the &quot; Economic Half @-@ hour &quot; of CCTV , I asked , &quot; Why is it called &quot; g@@ utter oil &quot; ?
it would sound much better if we could ren@@ ame it &quot; recycling oil &quot; and &quot; renewable oil . &quot;
sometimes , language can indeed be misleading and indicative of something unhealthy and bleak .
take towels for example .
if it were named towel , you would it to wash your face or feet .
however , if it was called foot wrap , you might never use it to wash your face .
this is because we tend to identify the function of a product based on its name .
so today I want to share with you some of my experience about originality .
is our daily drinking water not g@@ utter water ?
as we can learn from Shen@@ zhou VII , the water astronauts drink is actually made from urine by virtue of high @-@ technology .
most things are not that complicated as we think .
it is us that render them so complex .
today I want to talk about ten topics one by one .
as for the first one , I think that originality can make what is familiar to us original and what is new to us familiar , this is originality .
for example , 20 years ago when McKin@@ sey &amp; Company began to tap into China &apos;s market , I created a view named &quot; 5@@ W &quot; on marketing and sales .
I now ren@@ ame it &quot; 5@@ water , &quot; meaning 5 cups of water .
a small cup of water as it is , it is called drinking water in the eyes of a wise man .
the question is would you buy an ordinary cup of water or the one named drinking water when you get thirsty ?
then , smart guys brand it and this is now a drinking water with a brand .
now would you choose an average cup of drinking water or the one with a brand name .
I guess your answer will definitely be the latter .
given a cup of drinking water that is familiar to you and one with a brand name , you might choose the former .
given a cup of drinking water that is familiar to you and one you prefer , you might choose the latter .
I suppose this is the way the market is divided .
originality compl@@ icates simple things and simpli@@ fies the complicated ones .
while we were in our innocent childhood , our teachers often tried to tell us simple stories and our parents talked us some simple sense .
however , as we grew familiar with these simple stories and sense , we became complicated ourselves .
there is a lim@@ ite of the information a man can remember 。
for example , it takes enormous costs to manufacture milk and keep it fresh .
some would add some coffee into the milk .
if you claim that you sell coffee rather than milk , you can divide the market of coffee and milk simply by adding more coffee into the milk to produce white coffee .
more interestingly , some would add food coloring or flav@@ oring essence into milk , creating a new product , peanut milk .
the most excellent cup of water is called pearl milk tea .
however , in essence , it is still water .
each cup of pearl milk tea sells for 8 to 9 yuan .
the one in the front is worth 1 yuan and the one behind it costs 9 yuan .
so there are so many kinds of water that is more expensive than pure water .
mankind has been gripped by these 6 bottles of water for 1500 years .
among them , Coca @-@ Cola is the youngest one invented just 126 years ago .
there are other five cups .
of these 6 cups , three contain alcohol and three are fl@@ avored with caffeine .
they are designed to meet two basic needs of human beings : keep sober @-@ minded or not .
however , there are pr@@ atical dem@@ and@@ es .
if one tries to keep sober @-@ minded all the time , he might go insane .
if one always acts like a fool , he could not go to work .
therefore , sometimes we need to stay sober @-@ minded while on some occasions , we need to act less sober @-@ minded .
if you were told that Coca @-@ Cola was invented by mistake with the wrong f@@ om@@ ular that initially aimed to cure the cold , would you still drink it ?
and now I tell you that it is also a type of traditional Chinese medicine , and to put more exactly , it is a decoction of cinnamon .
however , instead of cinnamon , we call it Coca @-@ Cola .
the cat@@ chy Chinese translation of Coca @-@ Cola is thought to be attributed to Chiang Y@@ ee , a famous Chinese British .
originality means to bring seemingly independent and un@@ connected things together , making the dis@@ ordered things ordered and transforming the int@@ angi@@ bles into tangible .
as you may remember , when SARS swept across China in 2003 .
some l@@ atin letter and Chinese characters were used to describe it .
and even a logo was created to remind the public of the disease .
do you still remember it ?
I guess you cannot .
let me tell you the logo I am talking about was gau@@ ze mask .
I suppose gau@@ ze mask is the logo of SARS .
for example , if today 30 % of people on the train , in the subway and on the road wore masks , we would not be here .
back then , I was in South Africa and could not come back .
for there were so many wearing gau@@ ze mask and it made people nervous .
despite this , only a few people I have met claimed that they have seen SARS , even those working in hospitals .
the president of St. Marie Hospital , a famous hospital in Shanghai , once told me what we saw were pictures of diligent doctors and nurses who died in the fight against SARS .
these grave consequences concerned all of us .
as I read in some reports , a total of 135 counties refused to issue visa to Chinese citizens who therefore could not go abroad .
on top of that , the way we shook our hands has also changed to an impolite one , or we simply did not shake hands at all .
tourism , airline business , catering , and insurance all came to an abrupt halt .
there is no good or bad in originality .
most people have been talking about what is good and what is bad , even in the workplace .
take experiments for example .
you might think there is good or bad in doing experiments .
but I argue that in the world , there are only differences rather than good or bad .
this is because the world is changing relent@@ lessly , and good or bad is just inadvertently defined in our hearts .
let us watch a two @-@ minute clip of F@@ ear@@ less , a meaningful movie that has helped me a lot .
Li Li@@ an@@ jie as a versatile actor who has long understood this truth .
when we are ten years old , our teachers and parents tell us that there are bad people and good people in this world , and some literature works also divide men in the same way . this misleading concept ac@@ companies us as we grow up .
when we are twenty years old , we start to divide things based on whether they are good @-@ looking or not .
after we turn 30 , we are focused on whether one thing resembles another or not .
a while back , a Pic@@ asso exhibition was hosted in Shanghai .
however , of the few people who visited the exhibition , most of them could not grasp the essence of Pic@@ asso &apos;s painting .
the reason is simple .
during my discussion in the Chinese pavilion with Chen Dan@@ qing , we concluded that the reason why the Chinese could not understand Pic@@ asso &apos;s painting is that they have not adequately observed the authentic ob@@ jets , for example , the naked body of women .
as a result , we don &apos;t know what is authentic , which makes it even more difficult to understand things that are abstract and leaves little room for imagination .
in our 40s , we are still focused on what &apos;s wrong or what &apos; right .
during our 50s , we can distinguish whether one thing is appropriate or not .
after we turn 60 , we realize that there is no good or bad in this world .
do you think there are four directions in the world , namely East , South , West and North ?
if your answer is yes , please raise your hands .
today I am going to change this concept .
I have a friend who bought a house in Australia .
during a visit to his new house , I asked him , &quot; Which direction does it face ? South or North ? . &quot;
he answered , &quot; North . &quot;
I posed another question , &quot; How do you get any sunlight ? &quot;
he told me that this is the southern hemisphere .
we have not yet understand this simple question : there are no East , South , West and North in this world .
nor the difference of small and big from zero to infinity .
is there a difference between large and small ?
these is indeed one in statistics but it is not the case with sociology .
is a first @-@ class product better than a third @-@ class one ?
is 2 always bigger then 10 when we are playing cards ?
these are all concepts of men .
there are no East , South , West and North , because all of them are defined for our convenience .
this is truly what the human society is all about .
these concepts , non@@ existent in the world , is created for the convenience and purposes of men .
yesterday , Mr Zhou Yi , an excellent designer , told us there are also no rules and standards in design .
I would like to complement this idea by stating that you have to formulate your own standards and rules if you want to secure a promising future .
and this means to combine old elements , new relationships and different information .
you can tell this is a village girl from her red apron , yellow skin , unti@@ dy hair , two flowers on her head and the green back ground of the picture .
she looks so old @-@ fashioned .
by contrast , this girl is much more fashionable .
if you look at the other picture more carefully , you will find except the red apron , other things have not changed .
we only care about the differences , not the red apron which is almost the same with that in the first picture .
what do you see from this picture ? old elements or new relationships ?
traditional or fashionable ?
at a glimpse of the picture , you might tell me it is quite fashionable .
if the tatt@@ oo@@ ed girl , together with the star@@ bucks logo , the sign@@ age and the red lines , were removed , the picture would be not mo@@ dish at all .
this is New world of Shanghai , a popular sightseeing spot familiar to us all .
the combination of old elements or new relationships is all that matters .
the house is not our focus and all we care about is the addition of other elements .
we are all familiar with panda .
but someone clever has transformed it into the &quot; Kung Fu P@@ anda &quot; using his / hers imagination .
this is attributed to Stev@@ enson , a movie director who has never come to China .
this imaginative director somehow managed to put a pair of pants on a panda .
however , this is an American panda .
traditional Chinese symbols and elements have thus become intellectual property rights of others .
the American know everything about marketing and narrative ; we are just too conservative .
we have to make a remedy !
we must have our own ideas !
why can others be so creative using our traditional ingredients ?
originality means to identify new standards and rules .
how can we be innovative ?
I suppose , for starter , we need originality ; secondly , we need action ; thirdly , we need promotion .
why do we never promote what we have done ?
I think that is why we never have innovation and that is the reason of the pattern &quot; Bor@@ n in China . &quot;
why do we say something or claim the right of the innovation that we have done ?
for almost everything in this world is invented by us !
what is this ?
it is not an apple ! it is a red delicious apple !
do you understand ?
the other day , I ordered a pizza online .
my mother , 88 , was startled by its price .
she said . &quot; it is not wise to spend 98 yuan buying a big cake . &quot;
I told her , &quot; this is not a cake . it &apos;s a pizza . &quot;
what is the difference between rice rolls and sushi ?
the difference resides in whether nor@@ i is packed inside or outside the rice .
after you swallow a rice roll or a piece of sushi , they are all the same .
so please answer me : what is this ?
a red delicious apple !
repeat it again .
a red delicious apple !
thank you very much .
the world is quite simple and there is no good or bad .
horse milk grapes produced in Xinjiang province are very delicious .
on one occasion , a man from Xinjiang approached me and told me he has 6@@ 40 square kilometers of land planted with horse milk grapes which are delicious and juicy and come with a thin peel .
and he asked me to market his grape . I refused .
I asked him to eat American grap@@ es.@@ He said they are not tasty .
I replied , &quot; Yes , they are not tasty . you can try to pull a American grape but you cannot tear it apart . it is just because of their thick peel and tough texture that they are able to be sold worldwide , although they often come with a bitter taste and big seeds . &quot;
those who try to market horse milk grapes will find themselves in great trouble , because this delicate grapes will rot the day after you receive them .
there is nothing wrong with the grapes .
we need to figure out how to transfer such grapes appropriately and keep them fresh .
am I right ?
this is not the product &apos;s problem but a technical problem .
how can we preserve fresh grapes for a long time ?
bought in Wind@@ sor Castle , England , these two rulers are inscribed with &quot; British history rulers , &quot; which means rulers in history .
as we know , there are no rules in this world .
those who made rules have become rulers .
this is the origin of ruler in English .
ruler also means a measuring stick or a regulation .
most importantly , it refers to those ruling a country or a region .
I also bought a bunch of rulers in the United States .
each industry has its own ruler .
there is no good or bad .
it all rests with how the standards are formulated .
all we need to do is to decide whether to use the metric system or the British system .
unfortunately , we have abandoned 4 Chinese measuring units : Chi , cu@@ n , jin and li@@ ang .
this is truly a pity .
though not religious , we are using the &quot; Christian calendar . &quot;
what are these ?
sticky notes .
how were they created ?
it originated from unqualified 3@@ M adhesive .
back then , it was regarded as a piece of waste because it is not sticky enough .
however , it now contributes to an annual sales of over 6 billion USD .
being not sticky enough has becomes a standard that cat@@ ers to our new needs .
originality is actually the source of new productivity , competitiveness and profit .
it is aimed at achieving or creating value .
this is a graphic design I made in a visit to Taiwan in 2000 , and it has been published in China Time .
at that time , I asked myself , &quot; Should we use our hands or brains ? should we made products or create products ? &quot;
these two labels have essential differences .
we must strive to render knowledge more valuable and replace the pattern of &quot; Made in China &quot; with &quot; Ide@@ a in China . &quot;
in 2009 , M@@ arian H@@ ey@@ er@@ d@@ ah@@ l , a female artist from Norway , held an exhibition named Ter@@ ra @-@ cot@@ ta Woman which is them@@ ed on peace in the 7@@ 58 Square of Beijing .
ter@@ rac@@ ot@@ ta W@@ arri@@ ors , the essence of Chinese culture , were thus transformed into colorful ones .
with slightly bul@@ ging belly and chest , they wore armour and held weapons .
as war is a man &apos;s business , how can women be engaged in it ?
therefore , I do not have much affection toward these female ter@@ rac@@ ot@@ ta warriors .
once again , Chinese ingredients were leveraged by a foreigner .
originality is simple but innovative .
however , Fem@@ ale Ter@@ rac@@ ot@@ ta Army represents idea in Norway .
originality should be focused on human beings , not things .
it should be designed to alleviate the fatigue and difficulties of a men &apos;s burdened life .
this is the carpet of my company made by myself more than 20 years ago .
there are two paralleled footprints and two Chinese characters which means &quot; change the direction &quot; on it .
therefore , going forward , we need to steer our direction toward our customers and clients .
originality should be based on transp@@ os@@ itional consideration .
Steven Jobs is so magnificent , even in China .
his success rests with his ability to allow ordinary individ@@ ul@@ s to be more powerful and terrific .
for example , almost every one in China has begun to use i@@ phone and iP@@ ad , even those at my age .
there is no magic in cutting a steamed bun with a table knife .
but some ingenious people have managed to divide it into four pieces with one cut .
this is truly original and creative .
the key to achieving originality is to find the right person , have a right dialogue and do the right thing .
what we do is not paramount , but how we do it .
passion , enthusiasm , mood , emotion , friendship , and romance all play a pivotal role .
what matters is not the subject but the right thing .
what is the right thing ?
it is in fact the right subject .
even the rabbit has chosen to be diligent and run as fast as it could , it also lost the race with the tortoise .
why ?
it ran toward the opposite direction .
simple as it may be , we often cannot understand it , because we forget to consider things from the view of other people .
this is a picture taken by myself in Dong@@ ping National Forest Park , Chong@@ ming Island , Shanghai .
of the over 50 bir@@ d@@ c@@ ages there , this one was surrounded by a large number of people .
this a my@@ na , an excellent story@@ teller .
because this bird can say &quot; Gong Xi F@@ a Cai &quot; ( literal translation is &quot; be happy and prosperous &quot; ) and therefore can communicate with human beings , it has attracted the attentions of tourists from other birds .
the last point I want to share with you is that not all original ideas come from invent@@ ors .
some are ascri@@ b@@ able to merchants .
since the Qin Dynasty , the young Chinese have begun to be more focused on industry than on commerce .
commerce has long been overlooked .
it is merchants who have rendered originality more valuable by changing it into business .
angry Bir@@ ds , a popular game from Finland , has also tapped into China &apos;s market .
if it were named Happy Bir@@ ds , it would not enjoy such a good market .
most of us usually use &quot; happy &quot; to describe birds , but it has chosen the world &quot; angry . &quot;
what is angry ?
there are too many angry youths nowadays .
as a result , even children at 7 or 8 years old began to show signs of rebellion .
look at the toys at the right upper corner .
they are a package of gifts I received on Father &apos;s Day .
unaware of the sender , I opened it and learned that it was a package of angry birds mailed by my son who was then abroad .
why did he do it ?
when I played with my grandson , he knew that the little boy loves angry birds .
as presents for the Mid @-@ Autumn Festival , I received that box of moon cakes from one of my students .
among the some 200 boxes of moon cakes I received , this one made me and my grandson very happy because the moon cakes in the box took the shape of angry birds .
by virtue of the promotional efforts of merchants and Dan Brown , Da Vinc@@ i &apos;s works have been able to gain a worldwide reputation .
so I argue that not all original ideas come from invent@@ ors .
merchants have also played a crucial and meaningful role by commerci@@ alizing originality .
there are some 200 techniques and ways of achieving originality .
of course , there is no an introduction to originality .
there are , however , various concepts in Physics .
there are many ways of achieving originality in this world .
Haw@@ kins once stated that originality meant to center on personal skills and leverage intellectual property to protect such skills , so as to create new jobs and make profits .
finally , originality also requires our own efforts .
only when we observe can we come up with original ideas .
thank you !
it is easy to see that this is a world map .
there is a small country called Spain in Europe , and of course its people speak Spanish .
however , there is a notably large group of people on the American continents speaking span@@ ish as well .
why is that ?
this is attributable to one famous navig@@ ator Cri@@ sto@@ for@@ o Colom@@ bo who lived about 500 years ago .
there is no doubt that Cri@@ sto@@ for@@ o Colom@@ bo was a far@@ sighted explorer , for while people in his times believed that the earth was a flat disc , Cri@@ sto@@ for@@ o Colom@@ bo believed it was a round sphere .
in 14@@ 92 , 5@@ 20 years ago from now , Cri@@ sto@@ for@@ o , together with other 84 sailors , left Spain on 3 ships for the Atlantic without any hesitation . each ship was as small as 17 meters in length .
Cri@@ sto@@ for@@ o was convinced that he would reach the ancient ori@@ ental countries , namely , India and China , if he kept sailing westward .
70 days later , he came ashore on a vast continent that he believed to be India .
actually , it was a new continent .
there is also a well @-@ known Chinese navig@@ ator in the Ming dynasty , Zheng He , who was as adventurous as Cri@@ sto@@ for@@ o .
he was born 87 years earlier than Colom@@ bo .
Zheng He led 7 ocean expedi@@ tions into the southeast Asia in his lifetime .
Java , which is Indonesia now , was the farthest place his fle@@ ets had reached .
unlike Colom@@ bo , Zheng He commanded qu@@ ites a colossal fleet of over 100 ships in his prime .
the largest one was up to 125 meters in length .
how many sailors were there in his fleet ?
2@@ 7,@@ 800 in total .
when re @-@ examining Zheng He &apos;s navigation routes , we can find that he basically led his fle@@ ets along coastal lines or back and forth in enclosed seas .
Re@@ grat@@ bly , Zheng He didn &apos;t sail further sou@@ thward , as Java is not far away from today &apos;s Darwin , the nor@@ ther@@ n@@ most city of Australia .
let &apos;s come back and take a second look at the map .
there is a tiny country in Europe , England .
of course , the people in England speak English .
but why there are so many people across the world speaking English as well ?
let &apos;s not rush to discuss why the people in two major countries in North America , the USA and Canada , and some small countries in Africa , speak English .
instead , let &apos;s take a look at why do Australians and New Ze@@ al@@ anders speak English .
this is because of a navig@@ ator from England about 200 years ago , James Cook .
it &apos;s fair to say that James was also a top explorer for he made the most comprehensive coast chart in his times .
James completed his voy@@ ages with only a medium @-@ sized ship that was once used for coal shipment in the North Sea .
he first arrived at South America with this ship .
after a short break he continued his voyage further sou@@ thward with a firm belief in mind that there may be big islands or even continents .
then he found Haiti , New Zealand and then Australia .
how long ago was this ?
over 240 years ago .
let &apos;s look at a renowned arch@@ ipel@@ ago , Mal@@ vin@@ as .
actually , it has two names , the Falk@@ land Islands and Mal@@ vin@@ as Islands .
the islands bear witness to a notorious war called the Mal@@ vin@@ as War that happened exactly 30 years ago .
it is a war over sovereignty .
Argentina claimed sovereignty over this island on the ground that they are close to each other .
actually , it was first found by a British captain in 16@@ 90 .
according to relevant international convention , the sovereign of the island shall belong to whoever discovered it first .
in recent decades , there have been many advent@@ u@@ rers cropping up in China .
almost all of them are members of China Association for Scientific Ex@@ pedi@@ tion .
here are some examples .
in 2004 and 2005 when China started to build the Great Wall Station at the South Pole .
about 5@@ 90 people were dispatched there under the leadership of Guo K@@ un , one of the earliest leaders of China Association for Scientific Ex@@ pedi@@ tion .
now let &apos;s talk about professor Qin Da@@ he , who you may be very familiar with .
in 1987 and 1988 , 6 top scientists from 6 countries decided to walk across the South Pole , including Qin Da@@ he , a top glaci@@ ologist .
the 6 scientists spent 220 days walking over 6@@ 000 kilometers , collecting a large amount of glacier samples .
suffice it to say that this journey is a magnificent feat in science .
professor Gao D@@ eng@@ yi , the leader of the association , is the first scientist who has set foot at the South Pole , the North Pole , the Mount Everest and the wor@@ l &apos;s deepest can@@ yon , Y@@ ar@@ lung Z@@ ang@@ bu Grand Canyon .
in addition , he is an atmospheric physicist who spe@@ ar@@ headed the research of the North Pole in China .
he has conquered all the four poles in the world , namely the South Pole , the North Pole , the Mount Everest and Y@@ ar@@ lung Z@@ ang@@ bu Grand Canyon .
since its founding , China Association for Scientific Ex@@ pedi@@ tion has initiated several large scientific research activities at home and abroad .
their presence was seen in places of China such as the Mount Everest , Y@@ ar@@ lung Z@@ ang@@ bu Grand Canyon , Ho@@ h X@@ il , the source of Yang@@ tz River , Yellow River and Lant@@ sang , and Tak@@ la Mak@@ an Desert , and exotic lands , including the South Pole , the North Pole , the Great Ri@@ ft Valley , Amazon , etc .
most notably , in its expedi@@ tions of 1993 and 1994 , China Association for Scientific Ex@@ pedi@@ tion found that Y@@ ar@@ lung Z@@ ang@@ bu Grand Canyon is the deepest can@@ yon in the world .
before that , the Grand Canyon Colorado was believed , according to many geography books , to be the deepest can@@ yon in the world .
the significant finding by the association has renewed our knowledge of the deepest can@@ yon in the world .
personally , I think China Association for scientific Ex@@ pedi@@ tion , along with its top members and significant findings , will make their way into the &quot; hall of fame &quot; eventually .
in fact , scientific expedition tends to be overlooked in traditional education system of China .
some of you may still remember some Jan@@ pan@@ ese and Chinese students went on an explor@@ atory tour in the grassland of Inner Mongolia in 1992 .
the 20 @-@ kilometer @-@ long trip brought out a ten@@ acious quality of the Japanese students , who were in stark contrast to the sluggish Chinese students .
then , an accompanying correspondent wrote an article titled The Competition on the Summer Camp , attracting nationwide attention .
now two decades have passed .
has our quality education improved ?
I personally don &apos;t think so .
one year ago in Shanghai , an outstanding student from a top middle school took his own life at the time of the college entrance examination .
why ?
because he thought he could be admitted into Tsinghua University solely on recommendation , only to find that was just a day@@ dream .
this kid must be an extraordinary student .
he was a leader in his class , and had won awards in various compe@@ te@@ tions .
but he &apos;s gone .
more than a decade ago , I drove to the Grand Canyon Colorado when I was on an academic visit in America .
standing at the edge of the can@@ yon and admiring the colorful geologic layers , I couldn &apos;t help but think that I was so insignificant when compared with the can@@ yon &apos;s magnificent height and millions years of history .
if this kid had the same kind of experience of recognizing the in@@ significance of a human being , he would not mind whether he was enrolled by Peking University , Tsinghua University or East China Normal University , my Al@@ ma M@@ ater .
as China &apos;s influence multipl@@ ies across the world , more and more people , the young generation particularly , back@@ packed their way into the wild .
however , tragedies occur every now and then .
in 2002 , 5 students from Peking University who loved climbing mountains were found dead in Tibet .
the tragedy happened when they were climbing the 14th highest mountain in the world .
they were forever buried there .
actually , there is another incident a year ago you may be familiar with .
it happened in the Mount Huang@@ shan .
a local policeman gave his life when he was searching for students lost in the mountain .
on March 18 , another tragedy happened in the Eigh@@ teen Stre@@ ams , a scenic area in Fujian Province .
one 28 @-@ year @-@ old young man lost his life .
if we reflect on those incidents , or tragedies , we can see that they happened for a reason .
take the incident of the Peking University students as an example .
they were only free on summer vacation , while in fact it was a bad time for climbing .
and in the case of the incident in Mount Huang@@ shan .
the students dropped their GPS in the water during climbing , what &apos;s worse , it started to rain .
in that situation they should have get off the car .
as for the incident in the Eigh@@ teen Stre@@ ams , it was mostly due to the reck@@ lessness .
eighteen Stre@@ ams is hard to walk through even in the daytime and no one in that team had ever managed to walk through that area before , not to mention that the tragedy happened during midnight .
that &apos;s why I see their trip as an un@@ scientific adventure ra@@ thern than a scientific expedition .
considering those tragedies , China Association for Scientific Ex@@ pedi@@ tion led some top students in Beijing &apos;s A @-@ list middle schools to the South Pole , the North Pole and Mount Everest in the past several years .
in this year , I bring this project to Shanghai .
so far , there have been over 200 students who have set foot in the South Pole , the North Pole and Mount Everest under the guidance of the association .
among them , some have won the first prize in innovation contests with their academic articles , and others have been enrolled by MIT or Stanford because of this experience .
recently , I have been promoting a league named &quot; Scientific Out@@ door League for College Students . &quot;
in spite of the numerous school associations for outdoor activities , many kids are still unclear of how to conduct outdoor activities .
so I spend many time explaining to them that outdoor activities shall be scientifically guided .
cur@@ sory glance or intentional adventure are neither scientific , nor wise .
look at this map and set free your imagination .
what would it be like if Zheng He were as brave as Colom@@ bo to sail across the Pacific , or he had more luck to continue his voyage further sou@@ thward after reaching Java ?
we may not need Visa if we travel to the America continent or Australia .
if the student who had committed suicide had a chance to know Mother Nature to h@@ one his spirit , he would have been studying at a top university right now .
those people who had lost their lives in the mountains would also have been sitting among us right now , if they had conducted a scientific expedition rather than an un@@ scientific adventure .
as a saying goes , &quot; In order to attain wisdom , it is not enough merely to read books , you must be well @-@ travelled as well . &quot;
this is what scientific expedi@@ tions are for .
thanks !
good evening , everyone !
first I would like to know which one of you here is the so called &quot; Zhang@@ jiang Tech Guy &quot; ?
hands up , please ?
I have always wondered , who are the so called &quot; Zhang@@ jiang Gu@@ ys &quot; ?
allow me , a right @-@ br@@ ained person , to talk about love .
thanks to Professor Jin for saying that , &quot; Love is on the right , and marriage is on the left . if you want to get married , start with love . &quot;
first , let &apos;s talk about what do you love with .
I have a question for you all .
if you fall in love with someone and you want to express your love with a love song , what song will you sing ?
who can hum me a verse ?
anything will do .
thank you , thank you !
a lot of people will hum , &quot; The moon represents my heart . &quot;
one more girl , please ?
this lady , the one with the glasses and the blue scarf , what would you sing ?
also this one ?
what else ?
any other choices ?
exactly .
I &apos;m telling you , a lot of girls will sing , &quot; I would do anything for you . &quot;
yes , songs convey love .
but to tell you the truth , it is regrettable that we , as Han Chinese , are the least adept at expressing our feelings .
we can &apos;t sing , we can &apos;t dance , and we can &apos;t play instruments .
just like Mr. Sha@@ o just said , we are too implicit .
just a few days ago , I watched a Gao Xia@@ os@@ ong &apos;s show on You@@ ku called &quot; Xiao Talk . &quot;
it was very interesting .
he said , &quot; Music is not a tradition of our Han culture . &quot;
as you know , some ethnic minorities along the border can sing and dance well , and they can express their feelings very well , right ?
boys sing folk songs in the moun@@ tians across from girls .
if you love a girl , of course you will sing for her .
then , you can see other places in the world .
black d@@ udes , South Americans and Russians , they all sing and dance well , and they can express their feelings smoothly .
but for us , it is particularly difficult .
like Gao Xia@@ os@@ ong said , we can compose 10,000 beautiful poems , but not one beautiful song .
for people who can &apos;t compose beautiful songs , it is particularly difficult to express their feelings .
it is also especially difficult to fall in love .
also , we can &apos;t dance .
you all know about Chinese dance .
everyone has seen Chinese dance .
it is very interesting .
it doesn &apos;t include any movement of the hips .
I don &apos;t know if you have noticed this .
it doesn &apos;t have hip movements , but it does allow for bending backwards sometimes .
but there is another great nation in the world who doesn &apos;t even move their wai@@ sts .
their feelings are more re@@ pressed and closed than ours .
guess which nation that dances without moving their wai@@ sts .
have a guess ?
no , people from both South Korea and North Koreans dance well .
yes ?
there you go , it &apos;s the Japanese .
the Japanese dance like this .
this way , right ?
they don &apos;t even move their wai@@ sts , neither do they walk .
as you see , when a ge@@ isha dances , she just holds a fan .
I think she just walks around , right ?
therefore , this nation is more conservative than us , more closed and more extreme .
they seem to be very restrained , but when they go mad , they are as degenerate as you could imagine .
so let &apos;s see how they do relationships .
nowadays there is a new type of romantic relationships in Japan , ad@@ ored by men called ot@@ ak@@ u , or her@@ bi@@ v@@ ore men .
they don &apos;t fall in love with real women , they just watch A@@ oi Sol@@ a &apos;s porn , and then they fantas@@ ize with cyber@@ sex , which gives them great sexual satisfaction .
Oh , technology really is quite developed .
it makes people crazy .
but little by little , I think our Chinese young men and women are also becoming infected with such problems , which makes me feel very uncomfortable .
and so I have im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly become an expert on lefto@@ ver women .
I have never imagined I would be a psychological consultant dealing with single men and women who don &apos;t know how to love or who dared not to love within the past two or three years .
what I find hard to understand is that most of them were post @-@ 8@@ 0s .
I never thought as a shrink , I have to teach people about how to deal with a romantic relationship .
it conf@@ uses me a lot .
when I was young , I was forced to stay in college for five years because the school lied to me and said that I had to stay for five years for I ma@@ jo@@ red in international journalism .
but there were no classes at all and in the last year , we also didn &apos;t know what to study .
I was studying at Xiamen University .
it wasn &apos;t a place for study and the only thing to do was to fall in love , so we had five years to spend on this as much as possible .
I &apos;ve never thought that people should be taught to love .
as for young people nowadays , I realize that they are really afraid of falling in love .
when they talk about falling in love , they will tell me what they are afraid of in two bu@@ zz@@ words .
you all know them very well , what are they ?
getting hurt .
right .
I said , &quot; What is getting hurt ? Chinese is a refined language . did you learn your Chinese with the PE teacher ? getting hurt is the only thing you can say ? tell me about what exactly is getting hurt . &quot;
it turns out to be a bit of frustration , a bit of losing face , and a bit of things not developing in the direction I was expecting , and that &apos;s all .
so why do we only talk about getting hurt ?
you are still very young and you just had a little setback , so how did you get hurt ?
in fact , love is so different .
have you experienced all of it in your life ?
maybe I am a right @-@ br@@ ained person for real .
I want to ask you about your experience of love .
I will say a few words that you have experienced till this day .
I say a word , and you raise your hands , ok ?
have you ever experienced the vigorous intense love ?
who has experienced love at first sight ?
Oh , not bad , not bad , love at first sight .
who has experienced the kind of love that keeps you awake at night ?
what about the love that makes you lose all your appetite ?
what about the love that is so consuming that it makes you hurt ?
what about the can &apos;t @-@ live @-@ without @-@ each @-@ other love ?
what about the love that makes you a new person after hurting you deeply ?
good .
who has already learned to get over a relationship and move on ?
have you ?
yes .
congratulations .
you didn &apos;t live for nothing .
these are the very nice experiences that the world of love has brought to us human beings .
today people keep asking me - people who are in their prime , ask me , a middle aged woman - what &apos;s the point of falling in love ?
I said , what , is this a question that needs to be asked ?
if you have to ask me for an answer , I will tell you , especially for Zhang@@ jiang Tech guy , if you really want to ask me for an answer , I will tell you that love is the only power that can make us selfish and indifferent modern people to live as human beings .
there isn &apos;t any other power that can make us live so truly , except love .
because understanding yourself is extremely difficult .
your understanding of your colleagues , your friends , and even your parents is very limited .
you have the deepest experiences with your lover , with the one you fell in love with , and with the one you married .
this is the most profound interpersonal relationship .
through relationships you know what kind of person you are .
through relationships you know what kind of person he or she is .
you sleep in the same bed , there are no secrets to hide .
love also encourages us to care about a person who is not related to us at all .
it is the greatest love in the world other than maternal love .
you can imagine , a man and a woman meet by chance and fall in love in@@ expl@@ icably because of a chemical called love .
they give each other their dedication and even their lives .
how valuable this is !
what an amazing thing !
so love makes us care for others , give our love and feel our own existence .
nowadays in a modern society , the meaning of love to us is ever more important .
but we can see more and more people are afraid to fall in love and have no idea of how to deal with their relationships .
the development of advanced technology , i@@ Ph@@ ones , iP@@ ads , i @-@ what@@ ev@@ ers , makes us more and more incompetent .
on the one hand , we seem to have connections with the whole world through the internet .
it is possible that we could fall in love with anyone .
but on the other hand , there is nobody around you .
you don &apos;t know whether it is a human or a dog at the other end of the computer .
I have a lefto@@ ver friend who is now 32 years old and she has never been in love .
she came to me for consultation , then she suddenly realized , &quot; Mrs. Wu , I figured it out . I already had a boyfriend during the past ten years , that is my computer . &quot;
she said , &quot; I spend five hours on my computer after work daily . there are too many things to watch before sleep : American TV series , Korean TV series , Japanese TV series , K@@ ang@@ Si Com@@ ing etc . I became a fan of the new BBC version of Sher@@ lock Holmes .
she said , &quot; His fingers are so slender , so beautiful . he is exactly the kind of man that I could love . &quot;
it seems that we could live in a fantasy forever .
but in the end we are human beings .
we are flesh and blood .
love and being loved are eternal themes of humans .
what Mr. Sha@@ o just said made a good point .
life requires passion .
how can you fall in love without any passion ?
what if you really have no passion ?
I found a platform , an auxiliary tool . what is it ?
yes , dance .
because Han Chinese can &apos;t really dance .
who has had the experience of hitting on girls at a dance during college ?
hands up please .
who participated in a college dance and met your boyfriend , girlfriend , husband or wife there ?
wow , we got several friends here .
by the way , I am the generation that went to college between the late 8@@ 0s and the early 9@@ 0s .
there was no Internet or any cell phones at that time .
how did we get to know boys and girls ?
in addition to cold approaching them on campus , it was at the dances .
by hoo@@ king up .
at that time , even the least handsome boys practiced ball@@ room dance in the dor@@ ms , holding chairs .
this was because it was the only way they could show themselves at the dances in order to impress girls .
there was no Internet .
we could only practice our skills .
so love was a hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat .
some people will ask what a hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat is .
a hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat is with your eyes on the loved one , you hold hands and love in person .
you express your true feelings .
you have to quarrel face to face , see the tears and smiles , catch each other &apos;s breath , feel each other &apos;s heart beat and even have sex .
right ?
these are all hand @-@ to @-@ hand comb@@ ats .
now too many young people maintain romantic relationships over Q@@ Q , SMS , emails and private messages .
how can this work ?
even if you are dating online - which is good - you still need to get things done on the ground as so@@ ons as possible .
otherwise , the relationship is dead on arrival .
how could it work out if you stay online forever ?
there was a very cute young man who said , &quot; I always do relationships over SMS . &quot;
but I said , &quot; That won &apos;t work . &quot;
after being processed by our brains , the moment you type a word , it has already been through your mind .
your mind will modify your emotions .
you will definitely send out a message that seems rational .
but the receiver on the other end can &apos;t see your face .
misunderstandings thus happen all the time .
there was a very clever young man who said , &quot; Mrs. Wu , Wei@@ bo is good , because it has 36 emo@@ j@@ is . &quot;
I replied , &quot; Do you know how many face expressions people have ? thousands of them . &quot;
you all know the American TV series called Li@@ e to Me , right ?
language can tell lies , but bodies and faces cannot .
when you go on a blind date , you always say that there is no chemistry .
my dear , what is the chemistry ?
it is the sex appeal that two people face @-@ to @-@ face sense when they are in each other &apos;s magnetic field .
today , I &apos;m telling you , luck for you the Zhang@@ jiang tech guys .
the chemistry is the sexual appeal between two persons .
you smell her , feel her temperature , even touch her hand and feel the sweat on it .
all these elements determine whether you have feelings for her .
so I dug out one of my good friends , the Sal@@ sa God@@ father in Shanghai , Bob .
we established a love training camp together .
it was a platform for the boys and girls who dare not to love or don &apos;t know how to love .
sal@@ sa is a casual Latin dance .
it &apos;s very sexy .
it was invented by the Cu@@ bans living in the United States in the 1930s .
it is free @-@ style , just like the three steps or four steps college dance , and you can change your partner as you wish .
just like what the old people did in the park for love at twilight .
sal@@ sa is also much appreciated on the streets and in bars , by a lot of white @-@ collar workers in big cities like Beijing , Shanghai and Guangzhou .
because under the dim lighting , with two or more drinks and those well @-@ dressed men and women , hormones go up naturally .
then there comes the chemistry .
right ?
sitting in a restaurant in broad daylight , asking &quot; What do you do , Ms. Zhang ? &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wang , may I ask what your career planning is like for the future ? &quot;
&quot; I got a 150 m@@ 2 apartment downtown . I have already paid for a six @-@ year mortgage . there is fifteen years left . would you like to do it together ? &quot;
you cannot get feelings from this kind of blind date .
after all , the focus is on one question , &quot; Do you like this person ? &quot;
does he smell good ?
do you have feelings when your hand touches his body ?
this is what should come first .
you have got to like someone , after which then you can talk about other things .
as for myself , I have been studying international l@@ atin dance with a ball@@ room dance teacher .
I think , for me , it has been a process of self @-@ treatment .
I am learning one thing .
I have been working in a company for fifteen years .
I might be a very good business@@ woman , but how to get along with men has been an eternal problem for me .
dance is very interesting .
whether it is l@@ atin dance , international l@@ atin or Sal@@ sa , the men lead and women follow .
women nowadays need to study how to cooperate with men .
you are not just being a timid and lov@@ able little woman , you are not weak at all .
you are just giving the impression of weakness .
the key to dancing is not whether you are good at it , but to make your partner think that you are good .
right .
so if a Zhang@@ jing tech guy who cannot dance comes to me , I am capable of making him think that he is good at dancing .
Bob is very helpful to me .
you know , this man has magical powers .
as long as a single woman dances with him , he can tell how long she has been single just by holding her hand for a short while .
he is like a blind fortune teller .
if you dare , just go and touch his hand later , dance with him , and he will know for sure .
men and women or strangers , just judging by the distance they keep their bodies apart , we could get certain information .
what you have been through , the body reveals without lying .
OK , what &apos;s next ?
because I am not a professional dancer , next let &apos;s enjoy a beautiful Russian girl dancing Sal@@ sa with Bob .
you should be able to see how men and women flir@@ t with each other , and how they create chem@@ ist@@ ries .
let &apos;s welcome them .
thank you , thank you very much .
as you can see , life is wonderful when men meet women .
if you don &apos;t look good standing up or sitting , you might look very good while dancing .
my friends , wake up your bodies and use your body to love .
thank you .
good evening , everyone !
today , I &apos;d like to talk about Men and Rob@@ ots .
let me start with a story which happened last summer .
it was 8@@ pm on a week@@ day , most colleagues were off , leaving me alone in the office .
then , my robot , the one you see now , stood up and walked to the window .
there , he overlooked the view of the Huang@@ pu River and the bust@@ ling crowd below .
from our technological perspective , we can give many explanations of this robotic movement .
but at that very moment , I regarded the robot as a little kid , or a pal .
he did so because he had stayed in our office too long and wanted to go out and meet people .
one must wonder what technological level this robot has reached now .
I will have him show you right away .
famous stars .
Michael Jackson !
as we see , robots nowadays no longer looks &quot; robotic &quot; and clumsy as they once did .
and this one &apos;s dance features natural and smooth flow without much delay .
he didn &apos;t move that quickly in the latter part , though .
what is the technological highlight ?
human@@ oid robot &apos;s sense of balance .
it takes little effort for a man to stand still , which is a natural result of brain @-@ legs coordination .
for a robot , however , standing still is by no means easy , particularly when in motion .
just now we saw him stood on one leg when playing Tai Chi . how to bring a sense of balance to robot , particularly human@@ oid robot was a long @-@ term challenge to robot industry .
now this challenge of balance has almost been tackled by us .
do you want something ?
exploration .
exploration .
as we see , when the robot detec@@ ts an obstacle , he does not move on .
instead , he tries byp@@ assing me .
another major research challenge concerns how to coordinate a robot &apos;s walking ga@@ its .
please now pay attention to the next move .
if he &apos;s my son , I cannot bear to see him fell down that hard .
I warn you , if you don &apos;t stand up now , I will leave you un@@ charged until the Qing@@ ming Festival .
do you want something ?
follow me !
robots can keep the elderly company and guide the blind to walk .
in the near future , robots are expected to replace seeing @-@ eye dogs and work more intellig@@ ently and reliably .
robots can also help us take care of kids , and assist kids to learn a language .
take this robot as an example .
he speaks eight major languages and has the ability of speech synthesis and recognition .
I &apos;d like to say a few more words about the compani@@ onship with the elderly .
our society now is faced with an increasing aging population .
yet , the younger generation , busy with their work , has little time to stay with their elders at home .
given that , robots can take their place in reading e @-@ mails and news for the elderly .
also , robots can play a role in the I@@ ot .
the I@@ ot is now a much @-@ talked @-@ about concept .
smart home is an important part of the I@@ ot and has been included in the 12th &quot; Five @-@ Year Plan . &quot;
in fact , none of the home appliances such as TV and fridge in a home is smart .
smart home is enabled by a smart platform inter@@ connecting all the home appliances , which is ideally supposed to be a robot .
a robot has a lot of sensors , which can integrate all electrical equipments .
his eyes , for example , are in fact infrared sensors , which can help turn the TV on .
robots are also applied to healthcare industry , or rather autism treatment .
in the USA , this robot serves as a platform for au@@ ti@@ stic children &apos;s rehabilitation .
featuring some man @-@ like capabilities , the robot can speak , walk and communicate with children .
yet , kids do not regard him as a real person , but a doll or a little play@@ mate .
so , they &apos;d like to play with it .
there is a code of robots &apos; conduct , which consists of three points .
first , robots should neither hurt anyone , nor stand by idly when seeing someone hurt .
second , robots must follow men &apos;s instructions and at the same time not breach the first point .
third , robots must protect themselves and at that same time not breach the first and second point .
this is a generally accepted code of robots &apos; conduct in our industry .
yet , our observance of the three points may result in being conquered or ens@@ lav@@ ed by robots .
we may consider the first point that &quot; robots should neither hurt anyone , nor stand by idly when seeing someone hurt &quot; to be the most important of all .
in reality , however , man hurts each other from time to time .
under such circumstances , robots will fall into disorder , not knowing whether to follow one side &apos;s instructions or to protect the other .
based on the code of robots &apos; conduct , we need to think about the relationship between robots and men .
should robots be subordinate to men ?
or should they be equal to men like our partners or friends ?
I will leave this question to you .
perhaps in twenty or thirty years , our audience here , your children , or even children &apos;s children will come here for this program again and listen to our speech .
it &apos;s highly likely that the speaker will not be me , but some robot .
but I do hope that I will not be the topic .
so much for today .
thank you !
when you disagree or have a conflict with your family , what is your solution to the problem ?
who of you can provide an answer ?
ever since the very beginnings of mankind , we have had three ways to settle conflicts .
the first is violence , like quar@@ rels , fights or even war between countries ; and the second is by rules .
what if the existing rules are not applicable and new ones are not put forward ?
we negotiate .
therefore , negotiation is not an optional skill but rather an indispensable life skill , and it is one of the fundamental solutions for problems .
I have a friend , who lives happily with his family in Shanghai .
we once recoll@@ ected memories of the past just beside the rough Huang@@ pu River , and we referred to these memories as the &apos; tale of two cities &apos; .
this was a film , wasn &apos;t it ?
indeed they did live a life similar to that in the film .
he stayed in Shanghai while his wife stayed in Beijing , and we know that if couples are separated for long , problems will inevitably occur .
although they loved each other , the two could not bear the separation , especially since they had a baby to feed , not to mention other pressures and an unfavorable transportation situation .
first they resorted to violence and quar@@ rels , after which they did not talk with one another .
finally , his wife filed a divorce suit to the court hoping that the rules could come to her rescue .
he really wanted to save their marriage , but there was nothing that he could do , because his wife had made up her mind , and she refused to live such a life any longer .
what now could be done ?
he approached a negotiations expert .
at that time , I told him whenever you want to negotiate , set your goal first .
do you still love her ?
of course .
then do you want to win her back ?
certainly , yes .
are you willing to compromise within reason ?
yes .
here we may have readers who are law practitioners , and as we know , judges do not announce the adjudication at the very beginning of a hearing .
since they chose to settle their problems by rules , a negotiation was first required .
so the couple had to negotiate after the court was adjour@@ ned .
at this stage both parties could offer terms , and he was very determined to raise their child and renounce his property .
what was the reason behind this ?
what he said may surprise you a lot .
&quot; I will give you all of our belongings because I love you . you can live a decent life without worrying about the child . generally , women can live longer than men , so if you are still alone when our child reaches adulthood and I die before you , then he can take care of you . &quot;
he didn &apos;t divide their property fifty @-@ fifty or thirty @-@ seventy as is typically the case .
were he to do so , it would not be a negotiation but rather a dispute .
love for her was his biggest bargaining chip , and not only was his wife stunned , but the female judge was very surprised .
so the judge led his wife to another intermedi@@ ation room , and said , &quot; In all the years of my career , I have rarely met such a man . I can see your marriage has a solid foundation , and separation and disagreement should never be the excuse to tear apart a family . &quot;
right at this moment , he entered the room and emphasized one more thing to his wife , &quot; Let &apos;s not argue over right or wrong , Beijing or Shanghai ; let &apos;s let our child decide where we should live . wherever he goes to school in the future , or wherever is favorable to his growth , is the place we re@@ unite . &quot;
her eyes filling with tears , his wife still felt love at the bottom of her heart .
love was his leverage in the negotiation , and that ev@@ oked her love of their child .
their marriage was saved by negotiation before it broke down , and they restored a happy family .
from their story you may realize that negotiation can save a family or even a country from collapsing .
negotiation is not about deceit or conspiracy ; it is about reciprocal compromise and win @-@ win solutions .
again , negotiation is not dispensable , it is not a skill or technique that only salesman or businessman can grasp ; rather it is an integral part of everyone &apos;s lives .
if not a conspiracy , as you may assume , then what is negotiation ?
it is a win @-@ win solution .
you may find that speaking of negotiation , people either say they would never think of such a solution , or if they did , they wouldn &apos;t know what to do .
furthermore , they are reluctant to negotiate even if they know how , because they have the mindset that bargaining hurts feelings .
in fact , negotiation is not at all a simple bargain , it is obviously a mind game .
again what is negotiation ?
negotiation is the act of influencing people &apos;s decisions by talking with them .
you may also think that only resourc@@ eful people can be negotiation experts .
this is not true , however , as negotiation is everywhere in work and in life .
here is an example .
my friend once had an interview , and his interviewer said , &quot; I &apos;ve noticed that you are ranked 15th in your class , but not number one . we only recruit from the top 10 . &quot;
can you guess what my friend said ?
knowing how to negotiate , he answered , &quot; Yes , indeed , I was ranked 15th in my class , but I am number one to you . &quot;
quite surprised , the interviewer asked why .
&quot; though 15th , the top 5 students have gone abroad , the 6th to 10th were recommended as post@@ graduates , and the other 4 have already got job offers , so am I number one now ? &quot;
my friend was hired immediately because he persuaded the interviewer successfully .
and now he works for a famous company as a sales director in east China .
this was all because he knows how to negotiate .
that &apos;s negotiation for a job .
what about negotiation for a country ?
we have failed to reach an agreement with foreign countries over iron ore .
why is that ?
it is neither that our country does not try hard , nor that our workers are not working together . likewise there are not any spies .
the iron ore producers talked to Japan and Korea in the first place , &apos; you have to accept my price , because there are no iron ore resources in your country . &apos;
in principle Japan , South Korea can cut the price together with China , considering that we all believe that large procurement volumes are worth a discount .
then why do we have to bear high prices since China is the largest importer of iron ore ?
what we have not realized is that 30 years ago Japan purchased a stake in the iron ore producers .
therefore , although the prices of iron ore are raised and they have to pay more , as the iron ore prices go up globally , due to the WTO rule of automatic application , which states that all the commercial terms and conditions accepted by Japan and South Korea will be automatically applicable to third parties including China , they make China pay more by accepting the raised price .
since they are shareholders of the iron ore mines , they make greater profits .
obviously , they share the same interests as the mine owners .
in my opinion , skilled players think broadly while less skilled players think concre@@ t@@ ely .
it is neither because we have not attended negotiation lessons , nor because we do not execute well what we have learned .
the reason is because the terms and conditions are pre @-@ determined , and we have no pricing rights , which are also part of national sovereignty .
during the European sovereign debt crisis , China negotiated with Europe to recognize China &apos;s market economy status because the WTO regarded China as an incomplete market economy .
maybe you do not know how significant such a title is to China .
whatever we purchase is ab@@ normally expensive , like iron ore ; and whatever we sell is quite the opposite , yet other countries may still prosecute us for anti @-@ dumping .
why do we always lose these anti @-@ dumping suits ?
we lose because other countries do not treat China as a market economy , so they think that our selling prices are lower than our costs .
Chinese manufacturers feel frustrated because research can prove that the costs are indeed lower than the selling prices .
but they do not recognize our labor as a production factor , because they consider China as an incomplete market economy .
labor from a complete market economy should be chosen for comparison .
then what countries are chosen ?
Canada and Russia .
in Canada , a worker can earn CAD 100,000 yearly , an un@@ imaginable figure for Chinese enterprises , so in this case , we are definitely dumping .
as a result , they resist our cheap products so as to protect their own jobs .
so when China proposed to Europe that we could help them to tackle their debt crisis , in return , they could recognize our market economy status .
what was Europe &apos;s reaction ?
they said , &quot; Well , we can talk about your help later . at present , we are trying to rescue ourselves from this crisis via internal negotiation . as for market economy status , let us see what the results of our negotiations are . &quot;
what they imply is that they would rather be bankrupt than recognize our status ; and behind this , pricing rights matter a lot .
so their un@@ spoken words are , &quot; Even if we struggle in poverty , you can never have pricing rights . &quot;
what we care about are prices , while what they cherish are pricing rights .
such facts make it inevitable that whatever we buy is expensive , and whatever we sell is cheap .
I want to tell you all that pricing rights are also matters of national sovereignty , and we should negotiate for them .
you may notice that negotiation can be found throughout many occasions , like negotiations during family disagreements , business cooperation , labor relations in the NBA , hostage rescue , China @-@ America negotiations , European sovereign debt negotiations , etc .
the world is a giant negotiation arena , and negotiation is a part of our daily lives .
negotiation is not an unnecessary skill , nor is it deceit or conspiracy ; it is an opportunity for us to sit down and talk with win @-@ win attitudes about win @-@ win solutions .
my question for you all , then , is how do we negotiate ?
we influence people &apos;s decisions by talking with them .
communication is irreplaceable , and negotiation is indispensable .
thanks !
I have been asked many times lately by our media friends that if I &apos;m in the real world a sub@@ missive guy , or a w@@ uss , like Su Chun , a compliant husband I played in D@@ w@@ elling Nar@@ row@@ ness , given my excellent performance in that TV series .
well , I was actually struggling to answer such a shallow question very time they challenged me with it .
however , I tried to put it this way , &quot; Su Chun in D@@ w@@ elling Nar@@ row@@ ness , as well as Ma Ming in Mother &apos;s War and Chen Yu@@ fei in the recent hit Good Days , are figures I have played . &quot;
and I play many roles in my real life too .
I am a husband to my wife , a father in front of my son , and &quot; a damn good actor &quot; for my audiences online .
what I &apos;m trying to say is that each and every one of us is in fact an actor .
we are all playing our roles , day in day out .
let me take our camer@@ aman as an example . he is now shooting us down on one knee ; but it &apos;s also possible that he &apos;s the boss of a company .
as I known , the door@@ keeper out there really runs a company , but at this very moment , he is playing the role of a door@@ keeper .
that &apos;s it , our roles change .
as for me , actors usually keep a narrow circle of friends .
but there are actu@@ all some roles that I know well , that is the TV crew , or the film crew in some cases .
so , what makes a crew ?
in fact , it &apos;s a large group of people playing different roles , such as producers , executive producers , production directors , assistant directors , camer@@ amen , the cast , g@@ aff@@ ers , art designer , sound engineers , to name a few .
but , instead of chat@@ tering about directors , producers , or the cast , I &apos;d like to bring you closer to assistant director , a very , very important role that deserves much more attention than it does now .
how much do you know about the jobs of an assistant director ?
many of you would probably say that assistant director is the guy who stands by the monitor and give the well @-@ known &quot; ready @-@ and @-@ action &quot; order .
yes , that &apos;s his job , but only a quite small part of an extensive to @-@ do list .
what exactly does an assistant director do ?
technically , an assistant director should assist the director in doing some pre @-@ production jobs , from the selection of locations , actors and act@@ resses , to the coordination of music staff , art designers , sty@@ lists , g@@ aff@@ ers , and camer@@ amen .
during the entire shooting process , assistant director should arrange scenes well , and assist the director in maintaining everything on site in order , or checking the site , till the end of shooting .
maybe I was a bit wor@@ dy .
so , technically an assistant director is basically a utility man .
on the contrary , the director generally sits behind the monitor and rarely engages in any on @-@ site arrangements .
for example , we are going to shoot a big scene today .
what is it like then ?
let &apos;s say that we have a lofty for@@ tification wall in place , some soldiers on its top , and some at its foot .
so , what is the story here ?
soldiers at the foot are to attack the city .
then the assistant director should prepare for the shooting .
so , he goes all the way to select some lucky dogs from more than a hundred of extr@@ as on his contact list .
this is the time when he receives a hundred some costumes from co@@ stum@@ ers and begin his busiest hours of the day .
generally , the cast , director , camer@@ amen have not arrived yet at this moment , but the assistant director was already on site .
he has to ensure that extr@@ as are properly dressed and positioned .
the good @-@ looking ones in front and other at back .
after that , he will also put on a costume for extr@@ as and tell soldiers on the ground : &quot; the line is &apos; F@@ ight for bl@@ ah bl@@ ah bl@@ ah , &quot; you shout it out with me and run . &quot;
and then he will rush to the defense troops on top of the wall and tell them their lines , &quot; We can &apos;t have them come up here because bl@@ ah bl@@ ah bl@@ ah . &quot;
it may take a whole morning for him to get all those things done .
and that is the time when the director , camer@@ amen or g@@ aff@@ ers come to the site , asking if everything is ready .
the answer is &quot; Yes &quot; in most cases .
camer@@ amen and g@@ aff@@ ers will then get prepared .
right before the shooting , the assistant director will smear his face with dark make @-@ ups and join the group of extr@@ as .
the site is often less organized at that moment .
everyone , including the director and camer@@ amen , is waiting for the signal from the assistant director .
cameras will start rolling only when the assistant director holds the walk@@ ie @-@ talk@@ ie and says : &quot; all in place , let &apos;s roll . &quot;
in other words , assistant director is a vital position , which is extremely challenging , but often overlooked .
at times , you could see award @-@ winners of some viral TV shows or films giving their speech at ceremonies .
they said &apos; Thank you &quot; to TV channels , directors , producers , and scenari@@ sts .
rarely had I heard they were grateful for what the assistant director had done .
to be honest , I had no idea about why there are so many people choosing to be an assistant director , given the fact that the role is challenging and arduous .
so I talked to one of my friends who were doing the job .
I asked him : &quot; you just finished another hard task and you were injured . why not just stop doing this ? &quot;
he said : &quot; I don &apos;t know what to do except this one . camer@@ aman needs expertise , so does the g@@ aff@@ er . acting is even more challenging . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t totally count on social connections to keep your career , do you ? &quot; I asked again .
&quot; basically , yes , &quot; he answered .
he has been working as an assistant director for many years .
sometimes , assistant director can be the most dangerous position at the filming location .
I took a part in the TV series called Golden W@@ ool last year .
there was a scene where I was riding a horse , trying to escape from a group of ar@@ rest@@ ors .
I played for some close @-@ up shots while my substitute or my director friend played for some wide shots .
accidents happen at shooting .
for instance , one day we were shooting a horse chasing scene , one of the horses tri@@ pped .
there were lots of horses running and since the scene was shot on a grassland , it was easy for the horses to step into some of the rat holes on the grass and trip .
when my friend was on the back of a running horse , wearing a costume , the horse was suddenly trapped and fell .
he was thrown forward and smashed against the ground .
a few staff on site tried to help him .
the camer@@ aman or assistant camer@@ aman stopped the staff and yelled at him , &quot; Are you insane ? how dare you ! his fall will be worthless if you help him now . &quot;
so we all had to wait until the director said &quot; OK . &quot;
when we reached the assistant director , I found his leg like this , broken .
we all felt bad that day , complaining the difficulties of this role .
a couple of days ago , I went to the hospital to see him , and I couldn &apos;t help gri@@ ping about his choice , saying that some of his ex @-@ co@@ workers were doing a better job .
however , he said something that touched me so much , and he said : &quot; I didn &apos;t receive professional train@@ ings in the first place ; I didn &apos;t go to a professional college , either . the only reason that supports me to hang in there is that I want to become a director one day . &quot;
it &apos;s true that quite a few of his ex @-@ co@@ workers were once assistant directors and have become well @-@ known directors , such as the action director of Once Upon a Time in China III , stared by Li Li@@ an@@ jie .
a lot of big names in the entertainment or film@@ making industry also worked as assistant director , such as Zhang Y@@ im@@ ou and John W@@ oo .
Zhang Gu@@ ol@@ i , a famous Chinese actor that was once an assistant director and Zhang J@@ iz@@ hong , a producer that also worked as assistant director .
my point here is that there are people insisting on doing this job or playing this role , and some of them will achieve their goal because they never give up their dreams .
speaking of which , I think some members of the younger generation are somewhat impe@@ tuous . this thought may be inspired by the atmosphere today - it &apos;s Youth Day .
college students today wish to get a &quot; high @-@ paid easy job &quot; immediately after their graduation .
they probably haven &apos;t been aware that challenging roles like assistant director are actually the best for their growth .
let &apos;s jump out the circle of film@@ making industry .
you guys here must come from sectors where there are similar roles like an assistant director .
you may call it production director or something else .
I don &apos;t know .
but I know for sure that there must be someone in your workplace who does the coordinating and communicating work or do the chores , just like an assistant director .
they are actually within one arm &apos;s reach to the gold .
they have the opportunity to learn a lot from the director , the camer@@ aman and the cast .
they can acquire many skills by learning from other departments .
I believe they will grasp a chance one day , and become a great director .
finally , I &apos;d like to share with you my motto : the boundary of your ambition determines how high you can fly ; and your achievements depend on how big you dare to dream .
thank you !
hello , everyone !
today , I don &apos;t want to talk about dance , nor my identity , nor my dance achievements .
I just want to talk about how to be a mother .
as everybody knows from news reports I have adopted three children who have no blood ties with me .
it is precisely the three who taught me how to be a mother .
before raising them , I was completely un@@ concerned about education .
in our time to receive education , the social environment was relatively simple , and the information we received was what the state selected for us .
but now , even if we close our eyes and think about nothing , the information is still pouring into our ears .
when it comes to this era , we always seem to complain about the education system .
before walking onto the stage , I was thinking that is there anything wrong with our education system ?
I don &apos;t think so .
times have changed , so have people &apos;s demands .
but our educational concepts and institutions have kept unchanged .
when a child is successfully admitted to a key middle school or a good university , or stud@@ ys abroad in the United States .
his parents would sing their own praises , saying they have made great sacrifices for their child and all the success their child made is to their credit , or ex@@ claim how successful their education is .
it is rarely said that such success results from the school .
of course , there are still some owing this accomplishment to teachers .
but if this child fails or is admitted to a less good school , they would complain a lot , criticizing the exam @-@ oriented education and the college entrance examination and assuming the education system is the root cause .
so China &apos;s education system is a target .
yes , I think it is .
if our education system is a target that can give parents an excuse , we can blame the target and everyone has this right .
however , I think it is too late to blame .
all right , I &apos;m going to share three stories .
I remember when my eldest son was in the top class in kindergarten , all teachers told me that all the other children were taking extra lessons , and the dean himself said to me , &quot; Mrs. Jin , it &apos;s time for your son to take some extra lessons . &quot;
I said , &quot; what extra lessons ? &quot;
&quot; lessons about pin@@ yin or whatever else , without these lessons your son will fall behind in primary school . &quot;
and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t believe it . &quot;
but I was wrong .
when my son came home on his first day of the first grade in primary school , he was confused and asked , &quot; Mom , what &apos;s going on here ? here , this is called b@@ p@@ m@@ f , but at this side it &apos;s called AB@@ CD . which one should I follow ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Oh , forget the AB@@ CD and learn the b@@ p@@ m@@ f first . &quot;
then , I had a private talk with the teacher of the school .
I said , &quot; As a Chinese primary school , can our teachers teach English after the third grade instead of the first grade ? can we just learn b@@ p@@ m@@ f before learning English ? &quot;
the teacher said , &quot; I &apos;m afraid this is unrealistic , Mrs. Jin . the fact is that only your child is like this , and all other children have learned b@@ p@@ m@@ f in kindergarten . why didn &apos;t your child learn ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Why should a kindergarten teach children b@@ p@@ m@@ f when they should play ? &quot;
&quot; well , your son has already lost at the starting line , &quot; he said .
I asked , &quot; Star@@ ting line ? set by who ? &quot;
to be frank , I really want to slap this set@@ ter .
I said , &quot; Why should children learn b@@ p@@ m@@ f in kindergartens at the age when they should play ? why do primary school teachers teach AB@@ CD instead of b@@ p@@ m@@ f ? who made this rule ? &quot;
in 2008 , my eldest son was just in the second grade .
one day he came home from school and said , &quot; Mom , I am going to write a composition today . &quot;
what kind of composition ?
my Olympic Dream .
I asked him , &quot; Do you know what the Olympics is ? &quot;
my son answered , &quot; I don &apos;t know , but I see it on TV every day . there are five rings . &quot;
then I kept asking , &quot; Do you have any dream ? &quot;
he replied , &quot; No , I don &apos;t . &quot;
then I told him to write like that &quot; Olympic dream , I have no dream . &quot;
he said , &quot; Mom , I will get a zero for such a composition . &quot;
I asked , &quot; So do you have a dream ? if you have , write it ; if no , how do you write ? &quot;
there is no doubt that my son &apos;s composition got a zero on the next day .
the teacher said to him , &quot; You can make up a dream ! &quot;
I said to my son , &quot; I &apos;d rather you get a zero than make up anything . &quot;
it &apos;s okay to have no dream , but never make up one or expect I can help you .
I will never do that .
from that day on , almost all my son &apos;s compositions hardly scored a point .
among his compositions , only those wrote in the last year were better , because what he wrote was his attachment with me , which spoke his mind .
just as the case of Olympic dream , he didn &apos;t write about his feelings about the Expo 2010 , because I didn &apos;t take him to watch the Expo .
I said , &quot; did you watch the Expo ? &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t , &quot; he said .
&quot; so why do you write ? how can you write about your feelings since you haven &apos;t watched the Expo ? &quot;
&quot; the teacher said , &apos; just copy something . &apos; &quot;
later I found that my son ranked at the bottom of the class in composition writing .
what did the teacher do to the students at the bottom ?
the teacher would ask them to copy others &apos; compositions to pass the exam .
as such , the teaching results can be improved and the teacher could be called capable .
I got go@@ os@@ e@@ bum@@ ps knowing that , but there is nothing I can do .
I talked to my son about this every day , so as you can see in my previous interview I said that the requirement for my three children is to pass the exam .
I think it &apos;s enough to get cut off scores .
they asked why and one of my sons refu@@ ted me , &quot; Mom , the existence of the first one means there is the last one . &quot;
I said , &quot; sweet , learning is like swimming . 60 points means that you can pop your head out of the water and breathe . only in this way can you swim a long distance and it &apos;s okay to swim slowly . otherwise you have to hold your breath underwater and you won &apos;t hold it long . &quot;
my son said , &quot; ah , I see . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t matter if you can &apos;t swim fast as long as you don &apos;t drown in the water .
so he knows what I mean .
from the first grade to the fifth grade , my son has constantly improved his final exam scores , starting from 60 to an average score of 85 or even 87 in the final graduation exam in the fifth grade . I applaud him for making such progress .
because I didn &apos;t get him a private teacher or put him in any cra@@ m school .
all his achievements were made by himself .
when he complained , &quot; mom , I have too much homework to do . &quot;
I said , &quot; forget it . &quot;
when he said , &quot; I &apos;m too tired to go to school . &quot;
I said , &quot; how about playing at home ? &quot;
he said , &quot; no , I have to go to school . &quot;
I said , &quot; okay , then go to the school . &quot;
maybe I &apos;m too much of a ma@@ ver@@ ick . when he has too much homework to do , I would write on the book of parents signing that &quot; sorry , teacher ! there is too much homework for my son to finish . &quot;
well , I wouldn &apos;t suggest that you follow what I did .
it &apos;s just my own experience of raising children .
you know , children nowadays have a lot of computer homework , right ?
teachers ask the parents to receive the homework on computers and send it back after students finish it .
but my kids are not allowed to use computer or I@@ pad until today .
because I believe that their retina is not fully developed before the age of 12 , and TV and computer will affect its healthy growth .
some children wear glasses for hereditary reasons .
but if they don &apos;t have this gene , why don &apos;t you protect them ?
I think this is my duty .
however , I have to ease the control of my children when they turn 12 years old .
I told my son that he would use computers all his life since 15 or 16 .
so what &apos;s the hurry ?
when my daughter was in second and third grades , I was too tired to take care of her , so I sent her to my mother .
older people are more inclined to pam@@ per children .
so my mother allowed my daughter to watch TV with her , causing my daughter to wear glasses two years later .
a few days ago , I took her to buy glasses .
the doctor said she was only ten years old and the short@@ sigh@@ tedness could be corrected even at the age of 12 .
so we decided to try some vision correction methods , but it didn &apos;t work after a period of time .
what can I do to stop my daughter from watching TV ?
what should I do when she wants to watch TV or to play video games ?
finally I found a special way .
whenever my makeup artist came to my house to help me prepare for TV programmes , my daughter would be there , watching the makeup artist putting false eyel@@ ashes on me .
I asked her , &quot; do you know why I wear false eyel@@ ashes ? &quot;
she answered , &quot; because they make you more beautiful ! &quot;
I continued asking , &quot; do you want to wear false eyel@@ ashes in the future ? &quot;
she said , &quot; yes . &quot;
so I took a pair of glasses and said , &quot; look , I can &apos;t wear false eyel@@ ashes if I put on my glasses . &quot;
the night before , when I was preparing for this speech , I had a talk with my three children .
do you know what we talked ?
as you know , I &apos;ve been on a lot of TV shows and interviews recently .
my youngest son , a nine @-@ year @-@ old third @-@ grade child , has known that I adopted him and his non @-@ biological siblings .
children say what they like .
his classmates jo@@ ked with him , &quot; I just know you &apos;re an orphan , you &apos;re an orphan , you &apos;re an orphan ! &quot;
my son can &apos;t stand hearing that .
so we talked about this .
how do you respond when someone prov@@ okes you and is rude to you ?
I told him that you had to learn patience .
but if being provoked over and over again , you must hit back .
unlike me , a Chinese mother , their German dad takes a different approach .
he asked , &quot; what should I do if someone bul@@ lies me ? &quot;
I said , &quot; hit back ! &quot;
a typical Chinese mother .
the German dad said , &quot; no , you need to leave him alone . if he b@@ ick@@ ers with you , just walk away . when he gets bored , he won &apos;t bother you . &quot;
today , I came here at four o &apos;clock . but in the first three hours before my speech , I went home at 2 : 30 after I finished my dancing practice , because my kids will come back from school at 2 : 30 every Friday .
when I entered the house , my youngest son bl@@ ushed and said , &quot; mom , I have a very good mood today . &quot;
I asked , &quot; wow , what makes you so happy ? &quot;
&quot; when I went to school today , I found dad &apos;s approach worked . &quot;
I said , &quot; what &apos;s the matter ? &quot;
he said , &quot; One of my classmates provoked me today , but I just ignored him . then he tried to pull me . I said to him , &apos; You are so bored , &apos; , and he turned round and left . &quot;
now , my son is at a transition from primary to junior middle school .
I &apos;m going to make an analysis .
at this grade , students of class one and class two were all selected by placement exams .
but in class three there are only 14 students including my son .
why ?
the 14 students didn &apos;t take such exams and were selected by computers , by which they were put in where their hu@@ kou ( registered permanent residence ) is located .
so this is a backward class consisting of 14 students .
but of the 14 students , my son ranks at the top .
I asked my son , &quot; do you feel embarrassed in this class ? &quot;
he said , &quot; no , but I think there is something wrong with my classmates . &quot;
I said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with them ? &quot;
he answered , &quot; their learning attitude is not right . &quot;
I said , &quot; Why do you think so ? &quot;
&quot; every time we have a class , they don &apos;t pay attention to what teachers are saying and always look back at the clock on the wall and say , &apos; can we just get the class over ? &apos; &quot;
I clapped for my son at once and said , &quot; this is an important matter . you can tell your classmates have a wrong learning attitude , which is much more important than the scores . &quot;
but then I said , &quot; What about your attitude ? &quot;
he said , &quot; I just learn and don &apos;t care about them . &quot;
then I asked , &quot; how do you communicate with your classmates ? &quot;
&quot; I communicate with them if we have to , &quot; he answered .
I said , &quot; don &apos;t you feel lonely as your classmates don &apos;t play with you ? &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t have common topics to talk about , &quot; he said .
as a 12 @-@ year @-@ old child , he can chat with me like that .
I think he has the basic ability to judging .
for a mother , what I can do is to help my kids build their own values .
in fact , children often develop habits from our adult habits .
and who cultivated these habits , the parents . I hope that we can respect their choices and don &apos;t change their choices according to our own thoughts or because of our vanity and the social vanity .
now young people complain about the high cost of raising children .
but they are totally wrong .
because it is unreasonable to design children @-@ raising cost based on the cost standard for adults .
I have set a standard for my children when educating them . don &apos;t be a pain in the neck in society .
if my children are annoying when they enter the society , they have really fallen behind at the starting line because they are unpopular .
if your manners of speech and behavior make others comfortable , you have the opportunity to take the first step in starting a business or doing anything .
who can help take the first step ?
school ?
unrealistic .
so I want to be the one that helps my children establish right values , moral standards and attitudes , which are enough for them in the future development .
whether it is about being ourselves or educating children , we have to learn to do sub@@ traction in life rather than multiplication or addition .
art creation has given me a lot of inspir@@ ations .
it &apos;s particularly easy to make things complicated because we are best at it .
but it is no mean feat to simplify complex things .
when seeing me on the TV screen serving as a judge or participating in the show , you may think that I &apos;m a busy bee .
but no , I &apos;m not that busy and I just travel between home and work places .
this morning I went to the rehearsal room to practice dancing and got home at 2 : 30 .
after this speech , I have finished my work today .
tomorrow is the weekend and I &apos;ll stay at home .
now my career is in a rising trend . it seems that I can make money every day on various Chinese TV programs .
yes , but I think there &apos;s no end to making money .
when I made a lot of money , my son will be 17 years old .
it is unacceptable for me to be absent from his growth from 12 to 17 .
I think I can make money on a long term basis after my son is 18 .
but until then , I will spend my time with my children .
this is un@@ changeable .
don &apos;t assume your children will only communicate with you when they grow up . the communication between parents and children begins when children are born .
children grow up with all sense organs open to receive information .
when they can speak and repeat what adults say , they will give back what they have received in their upbringing .
therefore , I speak from personal experience . it &apos;s better for parents and soon @-@ to @-@ be parents to directly communicate with their children , treat them as growing @-@ ups and don &apos;t talk to them like a child .
I have three children and I have never said to them like these &quot; baby , drink this , &quot; &quot; oh , don &apos;t do that . &quot;
never .
it &apos;s not so much that I teach my children , but more that they have told me how to communicate with them in their growing @-@ up years .
this kind of communication and reflection also told me how to talk with others .
when I reflect on this , I found that my children gave me an answer to the question &quot; who shaped our children ? the society ? &quot;
no , it comes down to our own values .
because my values and judgment are influenced by the society , and in the end it &apos;s me who can shape my children .
what matters most is that you know what values you should inf@@ use to your children .
thank you for your time .
thank you .
the topic of my speech today is S@@ low down and enjoy your life .
I &apos;d like to share with you some stories before you wonder why I chose this topic .
eight years ago , I switched from the internal medicine to the emergency department .
on that day I was busy in the emergency room .
the param@@ ed@@ ics rushed in a little boy while using a resus@@ cit@@ ator to pump air into his lungs .
the boy was wired to an EC@@ G monitor with trac@@ heal cann@@ ula inserted into his mouth .
when I was there to give first aid , the ambulance doctor told me that the child passed out on a bus on his way to school .
fortunately , a retired old doctor at present gave him CP@@ R in time .
so when he was sent to our hospital , he still had his last heartbeat , but they could not save him and he died at only 14 years old .
there@@ upon it occurred to me that sudden death does not only happen to the elderly , it could happen to such young children .
the second story I want to tell happened last year .
it was also in the emergency room , a place mingled with joys and sorrows .
still , it was in the day .
this time the ambulance sent here a middle @-@ aged man , who came in with no heart beat or breath .
he was a rich man in Er@@ dos .
everyone knows that Er@@ dos is a filthy @-@ rich place , where even clean@@ ers drive Land R@@ overs to work .
here is the thing .
he was in Beijing for business and met his clients for tea in a five @-@ star hotel .
while drinking the tea , he was caught by a sudden chest ti@@ ghtness .
on that moment he did not realize that he was having a heart attack , instead , he called the waitress and accused her of using fake tea .
as you could imagine , he got more and more emotional that he fell down on the ground , losing his heartbeat and breath instantly .
when the ambulance arrived , they could not save him .
he was then sent to our hospital but we still could not bring him back after emergency treatment .
I learned a lesson from his experience .
it turns out that ground@@ less accusation against others can cause some serious consequences .
the third story took place this year , in the emergency room again .
it is indeed a place of stories .
a city fell in love with a boy from the countryside , but her parents were strongly against their relationship .
well , I am married to a man from rural areas , and my parents were also strongly against my decision .
then she drank par@@ aqu@@ at in order to show her determination to pursue true love .
I mentioned in my micro blog that par@@ aqu@@ at is a medicine without anti@@ dote , and one is doomed to die after drinking it .
even if there could be survivors , the possibility is one in a million .
she didn &apos;t know that what she was drinking was lethal .
as a result , from her admission to our hospital to her death , she was tortured for a whole week .
she underwent all kinds of or@@ deals until finally multiple organ failure took her life .
I couldn &apos;t bear to look at her eyes , which were all craving for life .
she would stare at the door of the emergency room every day .
her boyfriend from the village did not dare to come , from the moment she was in the emergency room till she passed way , he never showed up .
it wasn &apos;t until she died that her little boyfriend came to her hospital bed and cried .
but what is the point ?
so I keep telling my friends that if they want to show their loyalty to love , self @-@ destruction is not an option .
well , let &apos;s get back to my topic and explain why would I talk about slow life today .
because many people on Wei@@ bo have asked me how came I , a PhD graduate , was still a physician after working for 11 years , and whether I felt ashamed of it ?
I tell everyone I never feel ashamed .
why not ?
I &apos;ve thought about it .
I don &apos;t like to stay in the laboratory all day long , I don &apos;t like to be surrounded by groups of mice , I don &apos;t like to rip the dog &apos;s stomach open to do hem@@ odynamics or whatever .
I just like sitting by patients &apos; bedside to see their 24 @-@ hour urine volume , even to check out the exact amount of it per hour .
it doesn &apos;t matter if this is recognized by social values or not .
well , I also thought about writing articles and the types I would write could be about my clinical experience and tri@@ via .
however , I have been working in the emergency department for only eight years , and it is too soon for that .
I think the accumulation of such clinical experience requires me to work for a longer time , and then I could write a notebook that ret@@ ails for 0 yuan .
any doctor that wants one will get it for free and anyone could bring it home for free copy . I won &apos;t claim any copyright .
I think this is what I really want to do .
after I came to , thank you , to this understanding , our director got worried .
why ?
for being the only senior female PhD in the emergency department and eloquent at the same time , I did not participate in the application of research projects or apply for experimental funds with hospital leaders .
my leader was anxious and decided to send me to the United States to receive capitalist re @-@ education .
but they made a mistake .
I went there happily and came back even happier .
after I came back , I briefed the department on the advantages of capitalist medical system that I had observed during the past one year or so in the United States .
it allows you to engage in clinical practice without having to do any laboratory experiments .
there will also be special funding if you want to do laboratory experiments and clinical practice at the same time .
but these are completely two separate system .
the second point I want to talk about is what is &quot; success &quot; for us .
few Chinese people agree that the happiness of their family is success .
when I first arrived in Washington D.C. , I worked in a co @-@ building institution with our hospital so there were personnel interchange between the two hospitals .
at first , I needed to make friends with my colleagues , as I was kinda &quot; on assignment &quot; there , just like those special female agents who were asked to soci@@ alize in the past .
I brought with me a sum of funds granted by my superi@@ ors , I would invite people to have dinner or go to the pub with me after work and i offered to pay .
but one one would come .
at first I thought maybe it was about race , since I &apos;m asian .
in the end , a Chinese American told me , &quot; Yu Ying , you don &apos;t have to invite them for dinner . you don &apos;t have to . they go home to be together with their wife , children and lover . you don &apos;t need to waste your money . just come to work . &quot;
yet when they were in China , our department invited them to eat Peking duck and BB@@ Q , BB@@ Q as in the street food .
they gladly accepted .
then I knew what it means to do as the Romans do .
when I was in Washington D.C. , I lived in a Chinese family .
surrounded by Americans , I felt unhappy about not having enough opportunity to practice English .
one day when it was snow@@ ing heavily outside , a real heavy snow , I was by the window@@ s@@ ill , trying to take some poetic sel@@ fies .
at this time , I found that all my neighbors came out to shovel snow .
there were bull@@ do@@ zers , bro@@ oms and sho@@ v@@ els .
Oh , they were bust@@ ling and chatting happily .
so I went to the basement , took a shovel , and rushed out to work with them together .
there I was sho@@ vel@@ ing , sho@@ vel@@ ing and sho@@ vel@@ ing , before I became familiar with them .
after getting acquainted with my neighbors , I knew that there was a old couple n@@ ext@@ door and they had no children around .
they had been building a terrace for a whole summer and a winter , but they still had not finished .
down the road of my neighborhood , there was a family , with a neatly @-@ trimmed lawn and lots of Chinese roses resting on it .
every time when I went pass by , I saw the beautiful Chinese roses with st@@ ings .
as I reckoned , it must be a family of wealth or privilege .
yeah , they must be lawyers or some middle @-@ class IT guys , just like our IT boy here with cloud computing .
but one day at noon I skipped work and went home .
I found a yellow school bus parked in front of their house .
it turned out that the man of the family was a bus driver and his wife was a housewife with two children .
they lived a very happy life and I envi@@ ed them so much .
because their house , with those snow @-@ white rail@@ ings and green law@@ ns , completely fitted every detail of my bourgeois imagination .
after I returned from the United States , I began to wonder if I was asking too much of myself , so I lowered my requirements even further .
then my happiness index sky@@ roc@@ keted .
I felt just so pleased that smiles never came down from my face .
so now the patients will see me and say , &quot; Doctor , you look so happy . &quot;
well , is there any reason not to ?
after all , I am rich and gorgeous , right ?
then I began to sav@@ or every detail of life .
why ?
because I have been a doctor for so many years and have been in the emergency department for eight years .
I have seen too much Be@@ re@@ av@@ ements .
especially when I had a extremely day and four patients passed away on my shift on one day .
at that time , the nurse called me &quot; Three for the Day and One for the Night . &quot;
there was really nothing to do about it .
it was doomed .
but at that time , I found that I seemed a bit indifferent to the scenes when the family of patients cried for their death .
the urge to cry with patients &apos; family and the anxiety I got when I first witnessed the death of my patients , they have been long gone for me .
however , I &apos;m often touched by some small details .
for example , around last year , there came a young couple .
the woman had a persistent fever for unknown reasons .
we highly suspected a lymph@@ oma from the clinical experience and had a lymph node biopsy .
the pathological type of her lymph@@ oma was especially difficult to diagnose .
a lymph node biopsy requires ordinary routine st@@ aining , immuno@@ histo@@ chemistry and gene re@@ arrangement .
the whole procedure took three weeks .
it turned out to be reactive hyper@@ plasia , which meant there was no lymph@@ oma .
well , then we did lymph node biopsy again .
we made three times altogether and she had been hospit@@ alized for two and a half months .
the woman turned desperate and cried in bed every day .
the man was still calm and tried to cheer her up as usual .
every day when her fever cooled a bit , he would wheeled her outside to stroll for a while .
he carried a stainless steel lunch box to buy her whatever he could afford , trying to make her eat .
I go to work very early every morning , a habit developed during my study at Peking Union Medical College .
I will be there at the hospital before 7 o &apos;clock every day .
every morning I would see him wondering around with his lunch box , happily hum@@ ming a melody .
he would give me a shy smile and say hello .
for the last pathological analysis , we have the samples sent to two hospitals , one of which had the chromosome test result that diagnosed it as a T @-@ cell lymph@@ oma .
later the hemat@@ ology department said she was hospit@@ alized for chemotherapy .
the last time I saw him was in the emergency , they were st@@ rolling around hand in hand .
seeing me , the young man greeted me with a shy smile and his wife also showed a rare smile .
at that moment , my nose felt sour , really .
I just thought love like this was really rare .
because the love that we can stick to in difficulties and poverty is especially precious .
then let me come back to our topic .
my favorite American TV series is not ER , although I am an ER .
actually I like Doctor House .
why do I like it ?
I especially admire the writer , who could make up every extremely unreliable story so reliable .
but don &apos;t believe any of the medical scenarios in it .
none of them are reliable .
all diagnostic and experimental treatments in there will be first @-@ degree murders in real life .
but it portr@@ ays a Doctor House through one plot after another .
he &apos;s crippled , third @-@ class crippled .
he is an alcoholic and he uses drugs , he is a jun@@ kie .
nonetheless , we can see that what the writer tries to build is a doctor with a delicate heart and who shows his kindness in a unique way .
here is a scene of Dr. House that draws my attention : each time when he solves a difficult case , he will go out , there are snow@@ flakes floating in the sky , falling on his face .
then background music starts and he will have a happy smile .
another one is when the patient &apos;s condition is eased , the family members and the patient weep with joy and hug each other .
he will walk past the room and look inside , then an im@@ percep@@ tible smile turns up on his face , he then leaves with a sn@@ icker .
those are the scenes that move me , for I believe that there are the true , the good and the beautiful in every corner of life .
we just need a pair of beauty @-@ seeking eyes .
then why can I live so happily every day now ?
you see , Peking Union Medical College Hospital and my own leaders once required me to shut down my Wei@@ bo .
now the hospital &apos;s Party Committee Office is also watching my Wei@@ bo every day .
I think my political treatment is just like that of political prisoners , and I am extremely happy .
HA ha , I went to the west gate yesterday to pick up a package .
it was from one of my fans whom I don &apos;t know .
she sent me her hand@@ made cookies .
I was hum@@ ming a dit@@ ty all the way and going forward with the cookies .
at this time , I saw the director of our hospital &apos;s Party Committee Office coming over .
seeing her , I said hello .
she gave me a g@@ lower and then ignored me .
alright , it doesn &apos;t matter .
I &apos;ve tried my best , haven &apos;t I ?
therefore , I think someone like me that is sham@@ eless , ha@@ ha , broad @-@ minded and super flexible , that does not give a shit about what people think of him or her , when they live in a society with all kinds of issues , with so much pressure and with such fierce competition , I think I &apos;m doing not bad .
therefore , I hope that all of you here , after listening to my long speech today , will live out your true selves .
right , don &apos;t worry so much , don &apos;t care about other people think of you .
what &apos;s wrong with being a little plump ?
Adel@@ e was far bigger than me wearing that dress when she sang in Royal Albert Hall .
so I think there is nothing wrong for us to live out ourselves , and we will find our own place in an all @-@ inclusive society .
that will be nice .
thank you !
hi , everyone , do you listen to radio ?
that &apos;s right .
I &apos;m the one you hear from radio .
last week I received a call from one of my audience , a woman who had been looking for me for some time .
her daughter graduated from college and became a doctor in Shanghai .
so after retirement , she and her husband went to Shanghai to be re@@ employed in the logistics service .
she heard me on the radio while wh@@ iling away the no@@ on@@ time one day and then tuned in ever since that in the next few years .
lately she &apos;s been looking for me , making numerous phone calls , just to tell me : &quot; hey , Qin Chang , I could tell from the radio that you &apos;re from Shanxi . I want to send you some Shanxi @-@ fl@@ avored z@@ ong@@ zi that I &apos;ve recently made . &quot;
well , I haven &apos;t had the chance to have any of that flavor ever since my mother passed away eight years ago .
when I heard her on the receiving end of the phone , tears swelled up in my eyes .
the woman on the other end has treated me like her own daughter .
before this call , we are just familiar strangers .
we might have passed each other on the street , exchanged eye contacts , without knowing that we are already very familiar with each other .
that &apos;s the best part of being a broadc@@ aster , to be supported by so many strangers out there .
another girl , now 28 years old , has been following my program for 10 years .
when her marriage fell apart , I was the first person to know about her hard decision .
an old couple who suffered from conflicts between generations wrote me a long letter to vent their distress .
of course , there were never short of letters of complaint .
some even sent me the judgment papers , asking me to call the justice .
&quot; do you think it &apos;s a fair ruling ? &quot;
some petitioners who have been fighting for years would wait for me at the broadcasting house hoping that I could help solve their problems .
so I often ask myself , in an age where trust has become a scarcity , WH@@ Y ?
why am I capable of being trusted by many ?
for sure I &apos;m not like Miss Yu , the doctor from an emergent department in Beijing , who has been to our T@@ n@@ dao Forum , who has made loud noises on Wei@@ bo about the much @-@ criticized medical system but kept doing nothing in reality .
I &apos;m not Shenzhen Transportation Department which launched four press releases just to clarify some sort of conspiracy @-@ free fell guy case .
but hey , my colleagues , have fabricated the story of paper steamed stuffed bum .
and a story of Bam@@ ao In@@ cident where parents of a baby born with me@@ g@@ ac@@ ol@@ on found that par@@ aff@@ in oil worth of 0.8 RMB was as effective as a 100,000 @-@ worth @-@ of surgery , which is also fake .
one Job S@@ ear@@ ching Program was protested against by thousands of people .
while the European Championship was heat@@ edly discussed , one provincial TV station placed a broadc@@ aster in her bi@@ kini suit .
this brought me to shame .
the credibility of nowadays &apos; media is losing power .
here I &apos;m to answer one question : is it hard to gain trust ?
yes , it is .
I wasn &apos;t trusted as I am today .
12 years ago when I was assigned to produce this no@@ on@@ time news talk show , we made a lot of history and turned this show into one renowned both at home and overseas for the interview with Bill Clinton , former president of USA .
I had just worked for 6 years .
I slept in the dorm provided by the House and lived a self @-@ sufficient life , without much concern about my family .
also I didn &apos;t understand Shanghai dialect very well , especially the most native one .
I wasn &apos;t trusted by my audience in many areas , including my credentials and my experiences and was the target of a lot of criticism .
there were letters requesting me to be replaced sent to the Broadcasting House or even to me personally or more often than not , to my employer .
however , in retrospect , the hard time when I tossed and turned , had trouble sleeping and cried all day long has turned out to be all meaningful for me .
the distrust forced me to think one question every day : who are they ?
those audience who dislike me , who are they exactly ?
how old are they ?
what have they been through ?
what are they thinking about ?
what are they concerned about ?
what are they afraid of ?
what are they suspicious about ?
what do they want to know now , at this very moment ?
can I offer them the very thing they want ?
I started to picture my audience in my mind , their expressions , their looks , their gestures .
and I started to put myself in their shoes and res@@ onate with them .
slowly and gradually all of those strange voices became actual for me .
I had them just in front of me when I talked to the microphone .
and it was from then that my heart was opened .
I &apos;m no longer scared .
though I don &apos;t know the reason why .
I could put all my heart and mind into this new career that I &apos;m passionate about and I love my audience !
so I continued thinking in their shoes .
in the sea of information , which one might trigger a worthy discussion that could strike most ch@@ ords ?
how could I present more valuable information and ideas in just one short hour ?
how could I bring more diversified methods fo my audience to understand and analyse problems in the world ?
how could I bring people with different perspectives and values together for exchange of ideas and dialogues ?
I found ever more difficulties making these choices .
I even jo@@ ked once that this could be harder for me than to select the one to spend my rest of life with from my followers many years ago .
but I persisted .
I was good at making sel@@ ections during school years and now I keep doing what I &apos;m good at .
when you start to look at issues in other people &apos;s shoes , you can sense the change of mind even without any eye contact .
some audience told me , &quot; Qin Chang , I love the way you greet us at noon . the way you slightly raised your last syllable made me feel warm and familiar . &quot;
sometimes in the middle of some heavy discussion , people would ask , &quot; Qin Chang , change you sigh , please ! &quot;
or many audience would come to me , saying &quot; I know you would discuss this , which is right up my alley ! &quot;
or some would complain , &quot; One hour is too short . could you please tell your boss to make it longer to , say , one and half hours ? &quot;
well this suggestion is impossible .
though , ideas like this , as if happy pills , have delighted me greatly .
so during that period of time , I kept exploring my relationship with strangers and I learned the secret to establish trust with skeptical strangers is to always think in their shoes , always .
as you do so , they would witness some changes as well .
after I &apos;ve gained so much trust .
I became a little concerned in recent two or three years , or even a little bit distressed .
food safety issues , especially regarding melamine , have turned the made the word Sh@@ ock commonplace .
tragedies like Little Yu@@ ey@@ ue , the little girl who was run over by ruthless truck drivers and killed indirectly by hear@@ tless passengers , the gr@@ anny who fell on the street and whom no passenger wanted to help for fear of being treated as the p@@ usher ... are challenging our moral bottom lines .
some local governments even cheated in a top @-@ down manner in housing demolition and construction , losing their credibility all at once .
even authorities like China &apos;s Red Cross Association , The For@@ bidden City , are in shadows of scandals by probing of the public .
I started to become a bit distressed and think whether the trust I have , little though , could weather the storms in an environment where the system that ensures public credibility is lacking ?
concerned and distressed , until one day , during one episode , when we discussed the intricate relationship between doctors and patients , the trick@@ iest issue we had touched .
without saying , the real issue at hand , a prescription @-@ oriented medical system owing to the shortage of public funding and im@@ balanced distribution of public resources , would only be solved by some upper @-@ hand design to mitigate the tense relationship between doctors and patients .
but I &apos;m asking you , today , are we still on the waiting line for the improvement of system to happen just on itself ?
even a little change or a little push on the surface could make a difference .
that &apos;s why I believe the public should have their voice , their participation and expressions .
therefore I would call for discussion every time a new policy was launched .
my mind was full of it , the new measures introduced by the Ministry of Health to alleviate the doctor @-@ patient relationship , the system , the measures and their implementation ... my mind was full of them .
not long after we initiated the discussion , one audience called .
she had a very soft voice and didn &apos;t seem to be as anxious as me .
she said , &quot; Well , Qin Chang , here &apos;s how I approach this issue , I believe every doctor means to save people and none of them would exhaust manners to make their patients ill or kill them .
and as far as I can see from those medical personnel or my friends , relatives or alumni surrounding me , what they need most is nothing but the trust from the patients and their family .
so can I place trust in them ?
the answer is I &apos;m willing to !
I will trust them so as to gain the mutual trust . &quot;
she also cited another example .
she said once she went to draw blood in the hospital .
since she had tiny veins , the nurse needed to poke her several times to insert the tube .
every time the nurse did it , she had this nervous look on her face .
so she cal@@ med nurse down and told her to take it easy .
&quot; when I said to take it easy , the nurse , indifferent before , became all of a sudden lively .
she apologized for making me go through this .
as I said these words first , they had reached good effects .
maybe these words also helped these nurses to calm down . &quot;
this phone call of that day has since changed the v@@ ide my talk show .
her story has prompted other audience to share their stories as well .
the story that interested me most is this one : an audience told us that in one of the secondary hospitals in Xi@@ ab@@ ei District , Shanghai , an orth@@ op@@ ed@@ ics doctor had been using the most traditional , the cheapest and the most effective way to treat patients .
he could lower down the medical expense for the patients to only the fifth , or lower , of what they had to pay for in other hospitals generally .
he continued doing this and his patients wanted to share his story in my show so that more people could learn that there were still people , many people out there , putting an effort to make a difference even against a hard @-@ to @-@ change system .
I felt warmth and empowered .
while listening to their stories , words sur@@ faced in my mind , reading &quot; helping others is to help yourself and trusting others is to trust yourself .
it has convinced me once again that all my efforts to win the trust from strangers are worthwhile .
and every one of us could make our fair share of contribution , no matter how tiny it is , to produce positive changes to our situations , this big environment .
because after all , we are all particles that make up this environment .
I think maybe we could all become that butterfly over the amaz@@ on river , which without a slight shake of wings , could trigger bigger change .
after that episode , I went to find a line by Mr. Cu@@ i Wei@@ ping and wrote it myself : &quot; China is where you stand . &quot;
China is who you are .
China is what you are .
no room for darkness as long as you shine .
as you know , Leonardo da Vinc@@ i was a great painter .
however , he was also a splendid anatom@@ ist .
on one occasion , after dis@@ sec@@ ting 30 corpses , he thought he knew everything about anatomy , including bones , bloo@@ ds , and nerves .
nevertheless , as he contemplated human body in the smallest details sitting in the mor@@ gue , this curious anatom@@ ist could not help wondering : &quot; is there anything else about anatomy unknown to me ? &quot;
as a result , two questions struck him : where is soul ? and where is beauty ?
this is because both beauty and soul cannot be s@@ avored through dis@@ section .
I believe the only way for me to taste the wonders of love is to see it as a composer .
the Butter@@ fly L@@ overs , which is very familiar to us , was created 53 years ago in 1959 .
the story of The Butter@@ fly L@@ overs , or the household legend of Liang Shan@@ bo and Zhu Ying@@ tai , has been on the lips of Chinese folks for more than 16@@ 00 years .
we are all acquainted with these two tragic lovers .
as I can remember , in 2002 or maybe 2004 , Cu@@ i Yong@@ yuan of CCTV was hosting a popular talk show named &quot; Talk with Xiao Cu@@ i . &quot; and I joined him once .
on that episode , the culture secretaries of Ningbo , Yi@@ xing , and J@@ ining were invited to the programme .
this is because the locals of these three places all claimed their city was the hometown of Liang Shan@@ bo and Zhu Ying@@ tai . among these three places ,
J@@ ining surprises me the most for it is in Shandong .
during the programme , Cu@@ i Yong@@ yuan asked them : &quot; could you tell me which place really gave birth to the story of The Butter@@ fly L@@ overs ? &quot;
of the three people who tried their best to justify themselves , the culture secretary of Ningbo gave the most abundant evidence .
he claimed that both the tomb and temple of Liang Shan@@ bo had been found in Ningbo and Liang Shan@@ bo was believed to have served in Ningbo as a petty official and an upright one .
well , I have been to J@@ ining a while back , and I learned that a monument commemor@@ ating Liang Shan@@ bo and Zhu Ying@@ tai was un@@ earthed there .
the monument was authentic , as was the one excav@@ ated in Yi@@ xing .
finally , the State Council identified six places from four provinces across China as the birthplace of the story of &quot; The Butter@@ fly L@@ overs . &quot;
my purpose of narr@@ ating this story is to represent an idea that the birthplace of &quot; The Butter@@ fly L@@ overs &quot; can be in J@@ ining , Ningbo , and Yi@@ xing for it is not just a story and it belongs to China and even the world .
and I told the culture secretary of Ningbo that even if Liang Shan@@ bo was truly an upright official , people will not buy into this fact , because they prefer he was a poor scholar .
this is how Chinese people think of the story of these two tragic lovers in their hearts .
this tragic yet profound story signi@@ fies the relentless pursuit of love and courageous fight against evils by these two lovers .
in the end of this legendary story , they proved their love and spirit by transforming into butterflies .
Meng bo , the then deputy President and party secretary , once said , &quot; Why not make reference to their transforming into butterflies ? the transformation makes their resistance even more romantic . &quot;
therefore , as we composed this concer@@ to , instead of narr@@ ating a tragic story like Romeo and Juli@@ et &apos;s death , we added the section &quot; lovers transforming into butterflies &quot; into the concer@@ to .
only afterwards did we realize that &quot; transforming into butterflies &quot; was the true essence of &quot; The Butter@@ fly L@@ overs , &quot; def@@ tly symbol@@ izing Chinese people &apos;s fever@@ ish pursuit of love .
now , let me play the section of &quot; transforming into butterflies &quot; to all of you .
this melody is my interpretation of the spirit of this epic story .
as I have mentioned earlier , love , together with music , art , soul and beauty , is beyond our ability to analyze or interpret .
it is universal but cannot be fath@@ omed .
on this account , love is something we can only pursue or experience but cannot analyze .
hence , it is difficult for me to understand why the philosophy of love of today &apos;s young people hinges on how tall her / her lover is , and whether she / he has a big house or a large amount of assets .
after the great reform and opening up , many believe that the legend of Liang Shan@@ bo and Zhu Ying@@ tai is irrational .
Liang Shan@@ bo is such a smart scholar and Zhu Ying@@ tai such a beautiful girl .
how could he not recognize she was a girl after three years together .
this is definitely irrational , let alone &quot; transforming into butterflies . &quot;
at that time , some wis@@ e@@ acres even proposed to replace the traditional story of &quot; The Butter@@ fly L@@ overs &quot; with a new one featuring a smarter Liang Shan@@ bo who fell in love with Zhu Ying@@ tai at first sight .
nevertheless , all most all audiences did not like this smarter version of Liang Shan@@ bo .
on the contrary , they preferred the ner@@ dy one .
why ?
there is an aesthetic question .
this legend , though irrational , would not be appealing to us if it became rational .
based on the modern criteria of dating , Zhu Ying@@ tai would marry Ma W@@ enc@@ ai and Liang Shan@@ bo would never have a chance .
in this legend , Liang Shan@@ bo is an impoverished scholar .
however , it is the very romance between a poor man like Liang Shan@@ bo and a beautiful woman like Zhu Ying@@ tai that we need the most .
this could testify to the noble , pure and enduring aesthetic wish deeply embedded in our hearts to pursue love and beauty .
so I believe this also represents a noble mindset .
I suppose love is a legend and a sort of creativity .
the world is in need of constant creativity , so is love .
you may have noticed that Pic@@ asso , the great painter , whose last wife was 35 years younger than him .
Charlie Chap@@ lin , the great comic actor , was also 35 years older than O@@ ona , his last wife .
were the preference of a young pretty wife and the fic@@ kle affection of human nature the reason for a happily ever after ?
I &apos;ve had my doubts .
but I can now conclude that my doubts were wrong and I want to present an important idea that young wives can indeed accompany these ideological leaders going forward in the realm of art .
of course , choosing to be an old married couple also has its saving grac@@ es .
for example , your wife might kind@@ heartedly remind you to add some clothes when it gets cold or eat more food when you are hungry .
this is indeed warm and sweet , but how could she possibly manage to know you are growing and evolving in your heart as an artist .
on this ground , I assume that love is an eternal process of creation .
your lover is a never ending book which you have to read incess@@ antly in an endless attempt to catch up with his mindset .
next , I will introduce two songs to you , one called Bes@@ ide The Suzhou River and the another Ever@@ lasting S@@ mile , all composed by my father , Chen G@@ ex@@ in .
you may not be acquainted with Chen G@@ ex@@ in , but you must have heard of Rose , Rose , I Love You , Shanghai Ni@@ ghts , Gong Xi Gong Xi , and Bes@@ ide The Suzhou River .
all these wonderful songs were composed by him .
in my opinion , these are two songs about love .
beside The Suzhou River describes the story of two lovers walking alongside the Suzhou River .
the first singer to sing the song was Yao Li who is now 91 and still lives in Hong Kong .
she often recalls the time when working with my father . after finishing recording songs in the recording factory , they would take a walk on the banks of the Suzhou River .
as depicted in the song , &quot; Watch you look at me as I look at you ; thousands of words are expressed in silence . &quot;
how romantic is that !
though un@@ declared , the affection to each other is def@@ tly sprink@@ led within this romantic song .
the another one , Ever@@ lasting S@@ mile , was a love song my father wrote for my mother .
as the song goes , &quot; oh , my sweetheart , how beautiful you smiling face is .... &quot;
my father said my mother looked like Mona Lisa blessed with an everlasting smile .
as the written in the song , &quot; The everlasting smile makes me feel like in spring while in autumn and gives me sunlight while in darkness . &quot;
the middle of the poem reads &quot; I cannot lose the only spring and sun I have . &quot; this , to some extent , looks likes a prophecy of tragedy .
unfortunately , in 1957 , my father was labeled as one of the alleged &quot; righ@@ ti@@ sts &quot; and was therefore forced to leave home and died shortly afterwards .
this is how the prophecy came true .
the last two lines of the song are &quot; My sweet heart , do not be filled with sorrow . may you live happily with an everlasting smile . &quot;
after losing her husband when she was 46 , she has been singing this song while raising 4 kids until her death in the year before last .
I know this song will forever accompany her in the after@@ life .
I think their relationship and sentiment toward each other resemble the love between Liang Shan@@ bo and Zhu Ying@@ tai .
now , let me introduce my good friend , Miss Wang Wei@@ q@@ ian , the chief me@@ zz@@ o @-@ sop@@ ran@@ o of the Shanghai Opera House .
let &apos;s take a walk beside the Suzhou River in the beautiful melody composed by Chen G@@ ex@@ in !
as Mr Chen has said , after a walk in silence with the singer Yao Li , Chen G@@ ex@@ in , the splendid composer , created this excellent song that has been passed down to today within a few minutes after he returned home .
it is also the cat@@ chi@@ est ori@@ ental seren@@ ade I have ever heard .
we also call it &quot; Pro@@ found Se@@ ren@@ ade . &quot;
thank you !
accompanied by Mr Chen , we will present these two romantic songs to all of you .
when I was eighteen , I started my university life in Peking University .
at the orientation meeting , I was deeply fascinated by the profile of the man in the front row .
his pale face and the noble temperament threw a cup@@ id &apos;s arrow right to my heart .
since the first encounter , during my four years at Peking University , whenever I read Z@@ we@@ ig &apos;s Letter from an Un@@ known Woman , I felt every word seemed to strike a chord with me .
T@@ ag@@ ore &apos;s poems seemed to be my own love letters for him .
however , my love for him is completely plat@@ onic and will never grow old .
he was a senior student and graduated soon after I was enrolled .
four years later , I was going to graduate .
he asked me out before he went abroad and simply said , &quot; Will you be my fi@@ anc@@ é ? &quot;
at that moment , I was on top of the world , just like walking on air .
but after he went abroad , we exchanged letters spor@@ ad@@ ically .
and even when we met , we treated each other with respect , without any intimate act .
I was deeply depressed .
my un@@ requ@@ ited love for him lasted four years throughout my college life .
I carved in my memory his every moment , every sound and every note , as well as every encounter with him , every smile he gave me and every word he said to me .
but when I became his fi@@ anc@@ é , my feeling for him was not as strong as before .
so more than six months later , I told him I want to break up with him .
why did I do so ?
in fact , the six months with him has taught me what we really gain in love .
our love is at its most colorful and deepest when we have imaginary appointment in our heads for 90 % of the time .
but in a marriage , love is just a form that has lost its meaning .
so for me , we win love when we haven &apos;t got it , and we lose it when we actually get it .
from my first heartfelt love , I learned that what I loved was not the pale , arrogant and prince @-@ like boy .
what I loved was the love in my imagination .
so when I found out I could only be with him at the expense of the love I har@@ bored , I gave him up , the carrier of my love , for the love in my heart .
this is the first time I have understood the essence of gains and losses .
my second experience of giving up is when I resigned as the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of EL@@ LE .
= + + A@@ 28
during my stay at the H@@ ac@@ het@@ te Filip@@ ac@@ chi Press , I made huge progress and I associated that progress with EL@@ LE .
I gar@@ nered all the so @-@ called success and recognition .
but when I returned home from work at night and surveyed myself in the mirror .
I found how pathetic I was !
when I made such achievements , I felt I was no longer the best me , who was optimistic , creative , full of dreams and natural .
I hated the Yin Yan in the mirror and I wanted to find the Yin Yan that I liked .
so I qu@@ itted and set foot on India .
I had a slight idea that the two decisions seem to show that I cherish the best version of myself .
but I have no idea what &apos;s really happened .
after I left EL@@ LE , I knew that my inherent willingness to pursue progress and achievement would push me to work hard as before .
but what I couldn &apos;t handle is the sadness that job brought to me .
I fear if I pursue further in this way , the gap between the real me and the best me will be so wide that I couldn &apos;t handle it on my own .
so for myself , I gave up .
in India , I visited Ris@@ hi@@ k@@ esh , a city nick@@ named &apos; Yog@@ a Capital of the World &apos; and with hundreds of yoga training centers .
I came there with the sole purpose of finding out who am I .
what exactly do I want ?
what exactly do I gain ?
and what exactly do I want ?
seven days of performing yoga not only helped to stretch my stiff body , but let me realize my body was so dark and damp .
with every stretch and every meditation , the windows to my heart seemed to be opened with an invisible hand , bringing rays of sunshine to my body .
bathed in the sunshine , my body came to life , becoming fresh , sensitive and creative .
after days of yoga training and repeated trips to the town , I made a more concrete discovery .
when I first came to the town , it was a narrow , muddy street , lined with wild dogs , cows , begg@@ ars and fruit vendors with black @-@ stained hands .
but when I returned to the street on the third and fourth day , I saw brightness right before my eyes .
what I saw this time were the peace and comfort of the cows , the settle @-@ down of the begg@@ ars and the satisfied smile in the fruit vendors .
of course I knew nothing had changed .
people and things around me did not change .
it was me who had changed .
in India , I found the world , just like in the books I read , was an empty valley and a mirror .
because everyone sees the facts of the world , and these facts are also a reflection of themselves .
practices of yoga in the town helped to ease my pressure and unle@@ ash robust thinking .
amid the ch@@ ants and the sunny rain falling through the lin@@ den tree , I had an epi@@ ph@@ any that whether we are happy or not and whether we gain or lose something depend on how we see it .
a week &apos;s trip in India worked its magic , helping me to see life in a different light .
so if you ask me about my love and my career now , I &apos;ll say it &apos;s not just the plat@@ onic love in my 18 and it &apos;s not just simply re@@ signing as the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of EL@@ LE to find the real me . it &apos;s more than that .
now I realize everything has two sides .
whether it &apos;s a gain or loss depends on how you look at it .
what about love ?
love in itself is a rewarding process , where we bring nothing over and take nothing away , and nobody and nothing belong to us .
love is an intersection of two par@@ abol@@ as .
it disappears as they come back to their starting points .
what we cherish and gain is the moment of intersection .
we come to know and fall in love with each other , and we wish each other good when we break up .
we never have anyone so we never lose them .
we should be grateful for what we gained .
in career , we are likely to encounter many problems and difficulties .
for example , the founder of Yog@@ i Yog@@ a went through unthink@@ able difficulties to make the transformation from a writer to being an entrepreneur .
from my undergraduate study at Peking University , to the film academy for my master &apos;s degree and to my stay in France for my PhD , I won endless praise from people around me .
and I was the so @-@ called out@@ lier .
but in Yog@@ i Yog@@ a , I have my first taste of being scol@@ ded , insul@@ ted and sl@@ an@@ dered .
it could be the competition between rivals .
it could also be different opinions and ideas other have .
that may be one of the worst moments in my life .
I devoted myself to promoting and sharing yoga but ended up being vic@@ iously questioned .
but in retrospect , that lowest moment is when I had my biggest gain in life .
at first , I would defend myself amid the criticism and the blaming but in the end I stopped doing that .
I began to consider the most @-@ cited criticism to see what I should rectify .
by doing so , I improved my intro@@ spec@@ tion skills , I defeated my pride and I grew up .
that &apos;s what I &apos;ve got from the experience .
so everything in life can be a rewarding process , as long as we improve ourselves , remain open to things , and try to establish a higher level of thinking framework and see things from different perspectives .
that &apos;s what I want to share with you .
thank you !
before I begin my speech , I &apos;d like to ask you a question .
is there anyone who has never seen someone lit@@ tering in the street ?
raise your hand if you haven &apos;t .
well , it seems all of you have saw it .
then , I want to ask you another question .
just imagine you &apos;re walking down the street and someone throws a cigarette butt under your foot , how would that make you feel ?
happy or unhappy ?
raise your hand if that makes you feel happy .
OK , it seems no one feels happy .
well , this brings us to another question .
in that scenario , have you ever tried to stop or persuade them not to litter ?
raise your hand if you have .
well , there are three or five people raising their hands .
why so few ?
since we are unhappy , then what kept you from stopping them ?
I &apos;ve asked several people about this question .
before I came to T@@ n@@ Dao for speech , I made a visit to the barber &apos;s and had my hair cut .
the hair@@ dresser said , &quot; Just two days ago , I saw several well @-@ dressed and apparently well @-@ educated young people who finished their drinks , crum@@ pled the cups and tossed them on the ground and left . &quot;
then he came up and stopped them , &quot; Hey , why are you lit@@ tering ? &quot;
but he was greeted with strange looks .
so he asked me whether he was acting stupid .
I have posed the same question to some other friends .
some of them told me they were afraid of being beaten .
I have dis@@ su@@ aded people from lit@@ tering more than 100 times in the street in big cities such as Shanghai and Beijing .
and I &apos;ve got no beating .
not a single one .
better still , I have managed to persuade nearly all of them to pick up the litter .
so next time , when you walk down the street and see someone lit@@ tering before you .
you could say , &quot; Hey , pal , you dropped something . &quot;
most people will feel ashamed and pick up the litter straight@@ away .
the rest may respond by saying that they longer need it .
if they do say so , I would go on to ask , &quot; Well , you see , there is a dust@@ bin over there . would you mind taking a few more steps and throwing it in ? &quot;
most people will pick up the litter after two or three times of persuasion .
in fact , dust@@ bins may have out@@ numbered trees in streets in Shanghai , but why are some people unwilling to take just a few more steps ?
I want to share with you an interesting story .
there was a time when I was standing beside Shanghai Jiu@@ guang City Plaza , a well @-@ known , fashionable department store , and a young man cast a half @-@ smoked butt before me .
I said , &quot; Hey , pal , you dropped something . &quot;
OK , I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m sorry .
he was Japanese , well @-@ man@@ nered , and he bowed ten times .
as we all know , Japanese are known for being polite , civil and tidy .
but why do they behave so differently in China ?
of course , I was informed later that guy was Korean .
he pretended to be Japanese .
you know what ?
I did catch Koreans lit@@ tering in the Korean town near Shanghai Hong@@ qiao .
one of them was drinking Red B@@ ull beside a restaurant , and he threw the can on the ground when he finished it .
I came to him and said , &quot; Hey , pal , you dropped something . &quot;
&quot; OK , Thank you . &quot;
he responded in poor Chinese , unwilling to pick up the can .
&quot; hey , pal , you dropped something . &quot;
&quot; OK , Thank you . &quot;
&quot; hey , pal , you dropped something . &quot;
&quot; OK , Thank you . &quot;
in fact , Japanese and Koreans are tidy people .
many white @-@ collar workers in Shanghai and Beijing are well @-@ educated .
do they really have no idea about it ?
why is that ?
in psychology , this phenomenon is termed as the broken window theory .
the theory goes like this .
consider a building with a broken window .
if the window is not repaired , more neighboring windows will soon be broken .
because people will think this is for aiming .
if one advertisement fl@@ yer appears on a white wall , the wall will be c@@ aked with illegal ads on curing sexually transmitted diseases .
because people may think the wall is reserved for such ads .
if you see one pile of litter in the street , walk around the street and come back , and you &apos;re likely to find a second pile nearby .
because people may think the place is designed to be a dust@@ bin .
such occurrences are a common sight in our daily life .
consider we are waiting at traffic lights .
if someone rushes through the red light , you &apos;ll find many people following his step in running the red light .
there is another example . since the 2010 Shanghai World Expo , we have been promoting the escal@@ ator etiquette of &apos; stand right , walk left &apos; .
if one person takes the initiative to stand on the left , people behind him will naturally do the same .
I believe you must be irritated at these phenomena .
however , these phenomena are so common that we custom@@ arily ignore it by mentally pressing the &apos; delete &apos; button in our head .
we just pretend that we have seen nothing .
there is another word for this .
do you know what &apos;s it called ?
it &apos;s &quot; indifference . &quot;
but I &apos;m willing to be different .
it seems that when I was born , my parents gave me no &apos; delete &apos; button but a &apos; re@@ boot &apos; button .
so I have to interfere and actually I like pon@@ dering over things .
I think many of you , with a strong sense of justice , would like to be a med@@ d@@ ler .
but how to med@@ dle in a fun way ?
in a fashionable way ?
in a sexy way ?
that &apos;s what I &apos;m working on .
so today , I want to show you the three tricks of med@@ dling .
the first trick is called &apos; You &apos;re not alone &apos; .
do you still remember what I mentioned earlier ?
when you see someone lit@@ tering , just come up and shout out , &quot; Hey , pal , you dropped something . &quot;
but why bother shouting ?
interestingly , you &apos;ll find all people nearby , not only the guy who just threw the litter , will turn around to see whether they have dropped their purse .
when they find their purse in place , they will uniformly throw a gaze at the guy who just lit@@ tered .
this is the power of the crowd .
when he comes the focus of people , the more people look at him , the more ashamed he will feel .
and the more quickly people look at him , the more quickly he &apos;ll pick up the litter .
now , let &apos;s consider another scenario .
when you &apos;re waiting at the traffic light and someone is about to run the red light , you could say , &quot; Hey , that guy with hat . don &apos;t hurry . we can go together when the light turns green . &quot;
why ?
you have to shout &quot; the guy with hat &quot; because we have to give an accurate description of the guy &apos;s appearance .
but why ?
well , this allows people waiting to spot the red@@ light runner .
when he turns around to see all people are looking at him , he &apos;ll walk no further .
and those who are tempted to follow him will be deter@@ red because they know if they take another step , I may call out &quot; That guy with glasses ! &quot;
so the first trick is what I call &quot; You &apos;re not alone . &quot;
the second trick of med@@ dling is called &quot; He &apos;s not your enemy . &quot;
what does that mean ?
let &apos;s return to the case of picking up litter mentioned earlier .
when you remind the guy , &quot; Hey , pal , you dropped something . &quot;
you are not pushing him to the line of being immoral .
so what exactly is the relationship between you two ?
you &apos;re a kind @-@ hearted pass@@ er @-@ by , reminding him of taking his own staff .
so likewise , imagine we &apos;re on the way to the subway .
well , normally , I don &apos;t take the subway .
but what I like about taking the subway is when someone stands on the left of the escal@@ ator .
what would you do ?
&quot; hey , pal , excuse me . &quot;
in this case , the guy is not the one who stands in your way but rather someone who makes room for you .
actually , he is quite familiar with the etiquette of &quot; stand right , walk left , &quot; and with a kindly reminder , he will actively follow the rule .
this is the so @-@ called &quot; He &apos;s not your enemy . &quot;
the last , and also the most interesting trick is called &quot; Do talk sense . &quot;
what is it ?
it is the principle of avoiding talking relent@@ lessly when people litter .
hey , do not litter .
what if your litter hit the kids ?
even if you didn &apos;t throw the litter at the kids , it would be just as bad if the litter falls on the flowers or grass .
in fact , those who litter are quite aware of this .
and a gentle reminder will motivate them to pick up the litter .
let &apos;s reconsider the case of smoking .
imagine you &apos;re in a cos@@ y , well @-@ decorated restaurant .
and a young man takes out a cigarette and is about to light it .
you could just walk to him .
&quot; hey , pal , I &apos;m pregnant . &quot;
he wouldn &apos;t be so dumb as to ask why you as a man could be pregnant .
he will naturally put away the cigarette .
what if he still refuses to pick up the litter or insists on running the red light or lighting the cigarette after you have done what I &apos;ve told you ?
does that mean our persuasion has failed to achieve its results ?
does anyone think it is a failure ?
OK , you are quite rational .
in fact , it is not just the rule @-@ breaker that you are persuading .
I heard the following dialogues more than once in the street .
&quot; you see , do not litter in the future . &quot;
&quot; you see , do not run the red light in the future . &quot;
&quot; you see , this is a volunteer . you should follow his example when you grow up . &quot;
to many mom@@ s , I have been a role model for their kids .
your persuasion may help cultivate our future social leaders or prevent one child from a car accident .
so even if your interference does not work and the person you persuade does not act the way you expect him / her to , other people will still be delighted about your action , for this gives them hope .
we often compare life as a journey .
if one day , you and I are at the same bus station , waiting for the bus to take us to our next stop .
and then here comes a bus .
the door opens .
we move forward to ask the driver , &quot; Where is the bus heading for ? &quot;
the driver gives us an emo@@ tionless answer , &quot; Next stop , In@@ difference . &quot;
&quot; and the next ? &quot;
&quot; detachment . &quot;
&quot; and the next ? &quot;
&quot; fic@@ kle World . &quot;
&quot; so where exactly are we heading for ? what &apos;s the destination ? &quot;
&quot; I have no idea , but we are heading for the darkness . &quot;
put up your hand if you want to take this bus .
just like me , you won &apos;t get on the bus .
and then here comes another bus .
the door opens .
the driver invites us to get on the bus , smiling , but we want to know its destination , &quot; Hi , m@@ ister , where is the bus heading for ? &quot;
&quot; ah , the next stop is med@@ dling . &quot;
&quot; and the next ? &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re Not Al@@ one . &quot;
&quot; and the next ? &quot;
&quot; sparks of Fire . &quot;
&quot; and what &apos;s the destination ? &quot;
&quot; well , I have no idea actually , but we are heading for the sunshine . &quot;
my friends , put up your hand if you want to take this bus .
welcome !
let &apos;s go on our trip .
hi , everyone !
I &apos;m a gynec@@ ologist .
as the saying goes , &quot; In medical community , ophthal@@ m@@ ology is the golden discipline , surgery is the silver , while gynec@@ ology always do the dirty work , &quot; or &quot; Things are never simple but messy with gynec@@ ology .. &quot;
in general , gynec@@ ologist is an occupation that deals with the dirty , ti@@ res@@ ome and troublesome work .
of course , obste@@ tr@@ icians and gynec@@ ologists work hard .
we are always on duty for 24 hours .
sometimes we even can &apos;t make time for a snap at noon .
we have to wake up at night to do surgery .
but even if we don &apos;t get any sleep the other night , we still have to see the out@@ patients the next morning and operate sur@@ ger@@ ies .
sometimes when I am too tired to walk , I will also wonder , is this a right job for a woman ?
I would like to ask you a question .
there is a common disease in gynec@@ ology and obste@@ trics .
the medical term is called ec@@ topic pregnancy , commonly known as ex@@ fe@@ tation .
how many of you have learned or heard about this disease ?
please raise your hand .
Oh , there are a lot of you .
twenty years ago , when I just entered the workplace , ec@@ topic pregnancy was very rare .
there were at most a few cases in a month , no more than ten cases , and most of the patients who had ec@@ topic pregnancy at that time were married women with children .
but now the incidence of ec@@ topic pregnancy has increased .
for our department , at least 20 or 30 patients with ec@@ topic pregnancy are taken in every month , and most of them are young girls who are not married , let alone giving birth , some of them are still students .
during the World Expo the year before last , I met such a couple of high school students .
they came from Wu@@ xi to Shanghai to see the Expo in their summer holiday .
after their fun trip , they were about to take the high @-@ speed rail home from Hong@@ qiao Hu@@ b when the girl suddenly had a stom@@ ach@@ ache .
she was sent to our hospital for emergency treatment as we were nearby .
in the emergency department , she was diagnosed with ec@@ topic pregnancy , with her abdomen full of blood .
considering she must be hospit@@ alized for surgery , our nurse transferred her from the emergency department to the in@@ patient department .
the girl was scared and crying .
the boy was too terrified to do anything .
we told them to inform their parents since we needed their signatures to do the surgery .
they both were under the age of 18 , legally having no full capacity for civil conduct .
the girl cried and shouted , &quot; Please do not tell my parents . they would kill me ! &quot;
the boy thought for a long time , and told us to inform his parents .
I explained to him that his parents could not do anything else except paying the bill .
because they were not the guardians of the girl , and their signatures had no legal effect .
after a lot of persuasion , the girl finally agreed to let her aunt come to sign the necessary papers as her parents were in Hainan on vacation .
in the end , the girl &apos;s aunt , who rushed from Wu@@ xi to Shanghai , signed the papers on her parents &quot; behalf .
we reported the situation to the hospital &apos;s Medical Education Department , and told the girl &apos;s parents on the phone that , she unfortunately suffered from ec@@ topic pregnancy , and we must operate right away before they could sign the paperwork the next day upon arrival .
during the operation , we had to cut off one of the girl &apos;s fal@@ lo@@ pian tubes . what a poor girl .
she did not know what it meant for her future life .
the next day , her parents flew to Shanghai from Hainan .
seeing her laying in the bed , her mom cried her eyes out , and her dad &apos;s face turned death@@ ly pale with anger .
her young lover , of course , was nowhere to find .
perhaps you may feel confused , why is the incidence of ec@@ topic pregnancy so high now , and the patients are getting younger ?
over the 30 years of reform and opening up of China , the economy has developed , the people &apos;s living standards have lifted with bigger houses and better cars .
but there were two sides to every coin .
as the economy develops , something negative also appears .
in the early days of liberation , our country eliminated infectious diseases such as sy@@ phil@@ is , small@@ pox , cholera , and sexually transmitted diseases .
today , however , these diseases are res@@ urgent in many regions of China .
twenty years ago , if I said to a patient that the results of examination showed she suffered from sy@@ phil@@ is .
many female patients would be very angry and shocked , and some even would get furious and say &quot; He is so dead &quot; !
that &apos;s because at that time many female patients were passi@@ vely infected .
but today , if I tell a patient that her examination shows that she is confirmed with sy@@ phil@@ is .
many would respond calmly than myself , and some even would tell me that she is fully aware and has already been treated with the disease , impl@@ ying that she is not a new patient with sy@@ phil@@ is .
for a sy@@ phil@@ is patient , even if he / she has been treated , the re@@ ag@@ in of T@@ rep@@ on@@ ema pal@@ li@@ dum , the R@@ PR test , can be negative , but the antibodies to T@@ rep@@ on@@ ema pal@@ li@@ dum in his / her body cannot be removed , that is , we call the TP@@ HA test .
the test result will always be positive , just like the mark stamped on Wu Song &apos;s head , which can never be removed .
on the one hand , the liberal views on sex , an earlier initiation of sex activity and un@@ hygienic sex life are causes to today &apos;s dilemma .
on the other hand , young boys and girls lack the basic medical knowledge to take some necessary protective measures .
all of these have led to an increase in the incidence of pelvic inflammation , a disease directly related to the incidence of ec@@ topic pregnancy .
I also encountered such a girl who was under the age of 20 then .
she grew up in the countryside and went to Beijing to work after graduating from junior high school .
she was a cute and lovely girl , and had a boyfriend , maybe more than one .
when she was in Beijing , she had a fever and a stom@@ ach@@ ache , but she didn &apos;t get better after doctors there gave her medicine and infusion .
so she came to Shanghai to her mother and brother for help .
hospit@@ alized in our hospital , we gave her antibiotics for three days , but she was still ill .
later the B @-@ mode ultrasound showed there were two large masses in her pelvic cavity , which might be pelvic ab@@ sc@@ esses and needed surgical treatment .
a normal female &apos;s fal@@ lo@@ pian tubes should be even thinner than my little finger .
however , laparoscopic exploration showed her fal@@ lo@@ pian tubes were like the largest sa@@ usages sold in the supermarket .
you can imagine how swollen her fal@@ lo@@ pian tubes were , and they were full of pus inside !
I went outside the operating room to talk to the girl &apos;s brother and mother .
I informed them we had to cut off both of her fal@@ lo@@ pian tubes to remove her ab@@ sc@@ esses completely , so her condition could be treated .
hearing the news , the mother burst into bitter tears , and her brother also shed tears , because they knew the removal of fal@@ lo@@ pian tubes meant she would lose her natural fertility .
they considered for a long time , and reluctantly signed the paperwork for the sake of her health .
the nurse who sc@@ rubbed in with me was also a young beautiful unmarried girl .
she couldn &apos;t help thinking , a pretty girl without two fal@@ lo@@ pian tubes and her fertility , who else would marry her ?
what a young pretty poor girl !
till she recovered from anesthesia , she did not know her life had undergone such an earth @-@ shaking change .
in the future , if she wanted to have her own child after marriage , she had to resort to IV@@ F .
this is also one of the reasons why more and more people are doing IV@@ F now .
according to incomplete statistics , in the major reproductive centers across the country , two out of ten IV@@ F couples came to see a doctor because of fal@@ lo@@ pian tube infertility caused by ec@@ topic pregnancy or pelvic inflammation .
on the one hand , they have lost natural fertility due to ignorance in their youth .
on the other hand , when they get married and want to start a family , they have to seek medical care because of infertility .
while paying high medical expenses , they must endure the tor@@ ments of the past and the future .
such a strange phenomenon deserves reflection from each of us .
I also want to take advantage of T@@ n@@ Dao to tell more young boys and girls that premature sexual life , first of all , is harmful . of course , I also hope that there will be more opportunities for face @-@ to @-@ face communication like today .
secondly , I was young once , so I can relate that sometimes it &apos;s not easy to control oneself if the two really love each other .
however , I strongly recommend that some necessary proper protective measures be taken .
what are proper protective measures ?
let me share some of my own views .
condom is a very good tool for contraception , besides preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases , but it must be used during the whole intercourse .
just several days ago , I chat@@ ted about the topic with a few of my friends .
I jo@@ ked that in a few years when my son who is currently a pre @-@ primary pupil grows bigger .
I would tell him that condoms must be used during the whole process of all pre@@ marital sex intercourse , and it is best to have a check together afterwards .
it is also a protective measure for girls .
this is because some viruses like H@@ PV , i.e. , human pap@@ ill@@ oma virus , can be carried by men without getting sick ; however , persistent H@@ PV infection can cause prec@@ an@@ cer@@ ous lesions of female &apos;s cer@@ vi@@ x , which can finally develop into cervical cancer .
patients often ask me , &quot; Dr. Tang , why did I still get pregnant this month after I have taken the plan @-@ B ? &quot;
I ask her : &quot; how did you take your pills ? &quot;
&quot; I took one on the 5th and another one on the 13th , probably one again on the 18th or 19th , and maybe another one the other day in the last third of this month , &quot; she answers .
&quot; miss , are those sugar pills ? &quot; I ask , &quot; So you always take one when you feel like eating . &quot;
why is it &quot; a plan @-@ B &quot; ?
because it is the last ditch in case of an emergency .
the emergency contraceptive is used during the first half of the menstrual cycle , which only has 85 percent of the contraceptive effect , not 100 percent , and it will have no effect in the second half of the menstrual cycle after ov@@ ulation .
at last , I &apos;d like to talk about short @-@ acting oral contraceptives .
many young women are scared of contraceptives , because they feel that contraceptives would cause weight gain , breast pain or prolonged menstrual period .
in fact , the short @-@ acting oral contraceptives that are available on the market today are very safe .
I mean those contraceptives that are taken one each day for consecutive 21 days .
after years of improvement in the process , the estrogen in the pills is reduced , so is the risk , and the pro@@ gest@@ ational hormone contained is closer to the natural one .
therefore , such side effects as water @-@ sodium retention , obesity , liver damage and prolonged menstrual period are allevi@@ ated .
moreover , short @-@ acting oral contraceptives can not only prevent contraception , but also are conducive to protecting women &apos;s ovarian function , treating dy@@ sm@@ enor@@ rhe@@ a and end@@ ometri@@ osis , and adjusting menstrual cycle .
however , I &apos;d like to stress that contraceptives must be used under the guidance of a doctor .
in the end , I &apos;d like to talk about Dr. Albert Sch@@ we@@ it@@ zer who is known as the greatest doctor of the last century .
everyone in China knows Beth@@ une but Sch@@ we@@ it@@ zer .
in the West , however , Dr. Sch@@ we@@ it@@ zer is almost known to every household .
he is a German and a friend of Einstein .
Einstein once said : &quot; I have almost never met anyone like Sch@@ we@@ it@@ zer who is an ideal phan@@ tom of love and beauty . &quot;
he was originally a past@@ or , and received a doc@@ torate in both theology and and philosophy at the age of 25 .
when he was 30 , he was already a professor of philosophy and a famous pipe organ player .
being not only a player but also a repair@@ man of the instrument , he wrote down a lot of books on this subject .
but just at thirty , he was inspired by God and decided to study medicine .
we all started studying medicine at the age of 18 while he began to study medicine at the age of 30 .
at the age of 38 , he got a doctor &apos;s degree of medicine in Germany , then he and his wife chose to work in the jun@@ gl@@ es in Africa from then on .
so he was called a jungle doctor and an African saint .
in Africa , he ran a free clinic to treat patients .
not only the medical treatment was free of charge , but all food and housing during hospit@@ alization were for free .
he had been working in Africa until the age of 90 and was buried nearby the clinic in the African jungle .
his behavior changed the local generation and even generations in Africa because he not only gave people medical treatment , but also taught them to eat cooked food , how to drink healthy water , how to prevent some common infectious diseases and sun@@ burn in the local area .
and for the sake of patients , especially the nutrition of the in@@ patients , he would grow vegetables and breed farm@@ ed animals .
so without any dispute , when he was 78 years old in 1953 , he won the Nobel Peace Prize , and all the bonuses were used to establish hospitals .
Sch@@ we@@ it@@ zer is a man with diverse talents , but his life &apos;s achievements are derived from the power of faith and broad love .
this is also what contemporary people , especially our medical practitioners , should learn .
I have been preparing for tonight &apos;s speech for a period of time , including this afternoon , and I arrived here early without arranging any surgery and other things .
maybe I will do one less surgery or see fewer patients because of the speech , but if my speech tonight can inspire or help your in your future life in any way , or you can become aware that we must be responsible for each other to protect the common love between us .
I will be greatly encouraged . for me who has overcome my inner fear and nervousness to finally stand on the stage of T@@ n@@ Dao , this will be my biggest gain tonight !
thank you all !
good evening everyone .
may I ask you something about Shanghai Star Harbor ?
do you have any idea about it ?
what kind of organization is it and what &apos;s it for ?
I guess many of you have no clue .
nothing can be more devastating than parents grieve over the death of their offspring .
in Shanghai , the number of families with the loss of a child is growing increasingly due to various reasons .
diseases , car accidents or other accidents kill nearly twenty of children and young people on a daily basis , leaving more than 7,000 bere@@ aved families annually .
the loss of a child is devastating for the whole family for it makes parents suffer exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating pain and endure years of loneliness .
what &apos;s more , it ar@@ ouses panic and sorrow in parents without accompany of children at old age .
to help the in@@ consol@@ able families , Shanghai Star Harbor , a self @-@ help organization , was voluntarily established in 2003 by our ten bere@@ aved families .
the original purpose of the organization was to share the grief , gain peer support and find the ways to overcome the agony of the un@@ imaginable loss .
as one member of the organization .
I still miss my son in heaven who has left me for more than 10 years .
the moment he comes to my mind , I always have tears stream down my face on public transport or cry out loud at home .
I believe it &apos;s beyond the comprehension of normal families .
in our organization , the death of sons or daughters ro@@ bs many parents of all the hopes and brings them endless sorrow .
the bere@@ aved parents are in such a distress that they can &apos;t stop missing their beloved ones , and accusing and even tor@@ turing themselves every day .
one mother , for instance , blamed herself for the loss of her son who had fever caused by viral cold for a week and trag@@ ically died when the virus infected the brain .
disasters pile up on one another . on December 17 , last year , a dump car accident claimed the life of a father and his daughter .
as usual the father went to take back home his daughter after work but they never came back again .
though the Traffic Police Bri@@ g@@ ade held the driver liable for the accident , the non @-@ native driver couldn &apos;t make compensation since he had no money and his company was just affiliated to D@@ ai@@ hing Autom@@ obile .
the poor woman was so desperate that she almost wanted to take her own life .
many parents gave out their helping hands to keep company with her and give emotional support some time ago .
there are a lot more tear @-@ shedding stories like this in our organization .
to assist more parents in getting out of the desperate mess and regain control of their life .
Shanghai Star Harbor has made great efforts and organized many activities for the past several years .
on the one hand , we actively call for help and care from the relevant departments of the government for they have a boun@@ den duty for the bere@@ aved family groups .
on the other hand , we take initiative to carry out self @-@ saving activities and establish our ten@@ et of &quot; overcome the hardship , rebuild the life , help other and yourselves , and give back to the society . &quot;
when a new member bursts into tears , we won &apos;t stop him or her right now for he or she may feel better and relieved while crying .
when he or she cal@@ ms down , we will share our stories and feelings to help him or her face the hard fact , remind him or her to address problems reasonably and encourage him or her to find opportunities and hopes to move on the life .
in addition to caring for our new members , we often organize various activities .
on the family @-@ gathering events such as Spring Festival and Middle Autumn Day , the bere@@ aved families usually miss the children in great grief when others have a lot of fun .
on such occasions , Shanghai Start Harbor arrang@@ es the travel for the families to other places to relieve their pain and cheer them up .
all these efforts result in new progress .
before joined the organization , some parents felt that simple laugh seemed nearly impossible for them .
they were stripped of it for there &apos;s nothing that could be laugh about .
but since the entry to the organization , they have embraced changes one after another with the peer support and under the group influence .
one of changes is the smiles that re@@ appear on their faces .
therefore , we realize that making sad parents happy again is the purpose and commitment of the organization .
Ms. Wang , one of us , is already 71 years old .
it &apos;s griev@@ ing that she lost her offspring in her twilight years whom she gave birth to at middle age .
she grows from a person in need of help at first to a helper , the team leader of Xu@@ hui District , and now recommended as the director of the organization for the second term .
in spite of her old age and in@@ firm body with multiple fractures of foot , she could pay visits as needed to new members &apos; homes or go to see those in hospital at her own expense no matter they are in Pudong or Pu@@ xi .
and Ms. K@@ e , who lost her daughter , held an art exhibition to fulfill her daughter &apos;s last wish .
for the bere@@ aved parents , the children are like the shining stars above in the sky .
we believe we have the obligation to fulfill their un@@ fulfilled dreams and do what we want to do and what we are able to do .
with such belief , we have held plenty of public welfare activities .
we pay visits to the young wrong@@ do@@ ers in the house of correction to educate them to behave .
we enligh@@ ten the undergraduates in East China Normal University to show gratitude to their parents and cherish their life .
we act as special traffic volunteers on the Qing@@ ming festival as 30 % of children of our members are killed in traffic accidents .
according to the bloody lesson , we wish everyone must obey the traffic rules .
in the aftermath of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake , many parents of our organization were wondering what else we could do apart from donation when our country was in great difficulty ?
a common wish was that we should go to the earthquake @-@ stricken areas in Sichuan to extend our care to those who lost their children in the disaster .
at that time , our Ms. L@@ v created the slogan for our healing campaign , &quot; showing our sincere love and relieving your grief . &quot;
23 members came to Sichuan as volunteers with the assistance of F@@ ush@@ ou@@ yuan International Group .
during the ten @-@ day campaign , we visited five relocation spots in areas such as Shu@@ ang@@ li@@ u District and Shi@@ fang city .
we also helped more than a hundred of bere@@ aved families with loss of a child through the difficult time of their grief journey and encouraged them to regain confidence in the life and rebuild their homes .
moreover , we sent a large number of vegetables bought in Chengdu to these parents &apos; homes despite the danger of after@@ shocks and landslide .
finally we assisted the parents in the Ying@@ xi@@ u Town to establish a similar beneficial association like our organization with the help and support from Civil Affairs Bureau and Secretary of the relocation .
at the end of our mission , we were reluctant to leave .
for those who suffer know more about the power of love as if those who are tortured by cold are more grateful for the warmth of the sun .
our organization will carry forward the spirit that we will deliver our love to our children to ourselves , others and the society , because the love persists forever though our children are gone .
love should always be an inspiring force for us .
thanks .
good evening , everyone !
today we &apos;re gonna discuss whether talents are the results of cultivation .
I think many young people have just experienced cultivation themselves , and there are still others present who need to cultivate the next generation .
we have been talking about training high @-@ caliber talents all along .
let &apos;s see if the truly outstanding figures are results of cultivation .
for example , we know Sim@@ a Qian in the Han Dynasty , Cao Xu@@ e@@ q@@ in in the Qing Dynasty , and Lu Xun mentioned many times by Mr. Si Ru@@ i@@ jiang just now .
in fact , the above three are all top @-@ notch and outstanding talents in current discourse .
but what was their status when they made their achievements ?
firstly , Sim@@ a Qian suffered ca@@ stration .
Cao Xu@@ e@@ q@@ in was poor and des@@ tit@@ ute in his later years .
why wasn &apos;t Lu Xun a tolerant man ?
because he was tracked down and displaced by others so as to take a pig@@ sty for shelter .
how can he tolerate anyone when hiding in a pig@@ sty ?
therefore , the three above had neither received government funds , nor were they a scholar of The Rec@@ ru@@ itment Program of Global Experts .
they couldn &apos;t even afford low @-@ rent housing .
but they became outstanding figures .
you might say they are all literature icons .
then let &apos;s turn to other spheres in other countries .
America has a gross enrollment rate of 82 % in higher education .
what does 82 % mean ?
it means 82 % of young people can obtain a university diploma , while only 18 % cannot .
who are among the 18 % ?
bill Gates and Steve Jobs .
more surprisingly , it &apos;s Bill Gates who has the biggest influence on the education of the United States .
therefore , I am talking about those who have failed to enter the university today , the probability for them to become billion@@ aires is far greater than that of us college graduates , and they are also more likely to make a bigger difference on our educ@@ action than those working in the education system .
then how many primary and secondary school students are there in China ?
two hundred million .
what &apos;s our standard to train these primary and secondary school students ?
it is about the college entrance exam , about becoming the top sco@@ rers .
since the resumption of college entrance examination in 1977 , the total number of top sco@@ rers has now reached more than 2,000 .
we have traced their growing experience .
apart from those who ended up working in the universities , none of them has reached our expectations for them of becoming masters and leaders in all walks of life .
however , when almost all of these top sco@@ rers did not become the talented figures as we expected , here we found a phenomenon .
that is the &quot; Top 10 phenomenon &quot; : those in the first ten places in the class usually become the boss of the number one student later in their career and then become leaders in all walks of life .
so why can the top 10 do this ?
it is because our teachers tend to focus on two types of people .
the first type is the good students , as the teachers hope they can go get gold medals like Liu Xiang .
the second type is the bad students , as teachers often fear that they will fall behind and affect the honor of the whole group .
the teacher only cared about the two ends and ignored the middle of the spectrum , so those who were ignored later became talented figures .
so in this case , there is no need for parents to get anxious when their children fail to be the first .
otherwise , your children may only work for the number 10 in the future .
and if your child is in the middle spectrum , I would like to say congratulations .
your child may be the leader in the future .
moreover , I am now in a better state of mind .
my daughter in the second year of the junior high school is also among the middle group .
therefore , I did not send her to the Olympic math class , nor did I expect her to become the number one .
I just expected her to not grow up under the attention of the teacher .
back to our topic .
talent cultivation in fact gives us an excuse to destroy students .
there are roughly three ways of such destruction .
the first is the government plan .
our government departments are especially fond of talents .
they have already listed many programs , hoping that all of the people in China will become outstanding talents , because we are trying to turn China from a country of large human resources to a country rich in human resources .
last year , we knew that Ningbo launched a program to &quot; recre@@ ate Steve Jobs . &quot;
how much did it cost in total ?
50 million .
how many &quot; Steve Jobs &quot; are they going to cultivate ?
1000
well , I &apos;ve done the math .
each &quot; Steve Jobs &quot; has only 50,000 dollars , then that makes only less than three kits of the three @-@ piece Apple products .
this is a sati@@ re to Steve Jobs , a shame actually .
then there is another thing .
there are many plans from the central to the local governments .
our locality has a lot of programs , of which many are about famous mountains and great rivers .
we counted and found a total of 38 kinds of ac@@ dam@@ ic titles named after famous mountains and great rivers .
in fact , as we all know , the environmental pollution in our country is already very severe .
it is ok for university professors to pollute the campus .
if you dot their names with the famous mountains and great rivers now , it will make these landscapes st@@ ink further .
for example , there is academic corruption in Chang@@ jiang Schol@@ ars Program .
do you think there is any problem with the Yangtze River ?
not long ago , a Min@@ jiang River scholar had a problem .
people would say there were problems in Min@@ jiang River .
why bother it ?
China can &apos;t afford more contamination .
but we are still spo@@ iling .
Shanghai also has a program called Pu@@ jiang River Program .
therefore , I hope that if Shanghai wants the water of Pu@@ jiang River to be clear , it is better to cancel the program earlier .
those are governmental programs .
what &apos;s next ?
in@@ doctr@@ ination in schools .
we all know what a typical primary school class is like .
the teacher stands on the platform , and the students sit in a row , asked to either put their hands on the desk or behind their backs .
what does it feel like ?
in fact , it is to create an image of authority .
what is it asking for ?
students to obey the teacher .
then students are left to with an awe for knowledge , instead of a real clos@@ eness .
that &apos;s for the surface .
while internally , the teacher is insti@@ l@@ ling his own ideology into students and requiring them to think according to the teacher &apos;s ideas .
that &apos;s what we call &quot; theme goes first . &quot;
I met a college student who is a prime example .
he said that from primary school to junior high school and to senior high school , he had &quot; killed &quot; almost all of the people in his family in his writing .
first his grandpa , grandma , and then mom and dad , with cancer followed by other causes of death .
he never &quot; killed &quot; himself in his writing because in that way he wouldn &apos;t be able to write more articles .
why did he do that ?
we need to throw light on a subject through these deaths .
parents think highly of articles them@@ ed in death , &quot; Well , you finally have a good scores after you start &apos; killing &apos; people . &quot;
do you think there is still awe for life in such students ?
therefore , it is a must to conduct gratitude education in the university .
think about it : you still need to n@@ ag about being grateful when a child is 18 years old .
what a failure !
and these are the results of our in@@ doctr@@ ination .
now that in@@ doctr@@ ination has made people retarded , what is worse ?
that is in order to make students race ag@@ ains the time to study , some schools now set a tight schedule for them to work hard , not being allowed to leave the class , not even to go to the toilet .
what is the consequence ?
talent was not cultivated but they died of holding in pee .
let alone the central and western regions .
there is such education in Shanghai and we call it the &quot; captive education &quot; ( literal translation of a strict education ) .
due to safety concerns and the graduation rate targets , we not only forbid students to come out of the 45 @-@ minute class , but also ask them to raise their hands to report when they have to go to the toilet after class .
students are not allowed rough@@ housing outside the class .
the students trained this way are , no talent to say but if any , basically disabled .
this is the way the schools use to destroy students , which is claimed to be in their interests .
as for parents , of course they will not miss this opportunity to be an accomplice .
many of our parents are like this .
everyone claims to be a children &apos;s slave , especially for those post @-@ 8@@ 0s .
what does it mean by children &apos;s slave ?
it is purely an organization , guiding children what to do .
children become a reminder directory , even for ca@@ es@@ are@@ an section .
as we all know , now sem@@ esters are required to begin on September 1 , which is strictly implemented .
some parents calculated the expected date of delivery should be September 3 .
Oh no .
they thought their child won &apos;t be able to go to school until the next year , so they must find a way to get it out , and the children will get out like this .
that &apos;s why the rush season of ca@@ es@@ are@@ an sections falls in July and August , a good time for business for hospitals .
then when the child just came out , it started early education in no time before one year old .
the cost of early education is really expensive , 180 yuan an hour , but parents are willing to pay .
though I don &apos;t know what they learn on earth , but they do this on the presumption that their children would earn so much money in the future under this accumulation of money now invested .
then our students begin to learn pin@@ yin , Chinese characters and mathematics when they are 3 years old before going to kindergarten .
their questions in homework could be so difficult as to go beyond my capability .
are children cultivated this way br@@ ill@@ ant ?
what is the result ?
our children found that they had no personality and no interests in learning when they graduated from high school .
only 10 % of the students can clearly state which university they want to go to and what major they want to study .
therefore , the success of our education has made children become learning tools and slaves according to the parents &apos; models and what they fail to be is themselves .
this is a very serious problem .
under such a serious problem , we can notice that the growth we provide for students is what our adults want , not what students want .
this is not cultivating talents , but our shadows and accessories .
therefore , real education does not adopt the in@@ doctr@@ ination mode to create a certain talent , to cultivate talents or to shape talents .
rather , it needs our parents , schools and external environment to provide them with education and guidance in two aspects .
the first aspect is diversified education .
we know that if a student has no choice , we only have rice for him , then he can only eat rice and never steamed corn bread , or other nutritious food .
today &apos;s education in China is to integrate all students into one model and one track .
2,000 people fight over tickets to university in the college entrance examination .
a problem occurs herein .
a good education should provide students with various disciplines other than knowledge disciplines , such as music , sports , cooking , car@@ pen@@ try , handic@@ rafts etc. so that students could make their own choices .
the problem now is that some schools that offer such opportunities , but in fact we regard these subjects as unimportant classes , holding that they are of no value or significance to the college entrance examination , so everyone does not care .
the final result is that our students only learn mathematics , physics , chemistry and Chinese .
then , what is the purpose of studying ?
it is called &quot; studying is useful and reading is useless . &quot;
it is simply regarded as a tool for schooling .
ultimately , our students lose their independent character and thinking .
besides , ecological education is also needed .
everyone knows where the real pillar material lies : in the pri@@ m@@ eval forest .
have you ever seen someone run into the pri@@ m@@ eval forest and surround a pillar to pr@@ une it and fertili@@ ze it ?
what do we need to do ?
preventing pollution , pests and fire .
yet we are exactly destroying this ecology today .
for example , our administrative department &apos;s assessment is a serious pollution to our students .
take another example .
our parents or teachers , in the name of best wishes to the students , will continue to pr@@ une and fertili@@ ze them .
eventually students were destroyed .
in the entire ecological environment , there are shrubs , trees , flowers and other plants .
if we must make flowers out of a grass , a towering tree out of a flower , what will that bring to our children .
they will be neither fish nor fowl .
besides , only after a big tree comes out can it be used as a stool and a pillar .
before the big tree is developed , it is absolutely impossible for us to cultivate the tree as it should be , Right ?
however , we have determined the future of our children from the very beginning , and we will train them according to this model .
finally , the ecology of education is destroyed , too .
in order to ensure the ecology of education , I think , first , our government should reduce interference in our education and not use various indicators to pollute education in the name of kindness , including the cancellation of various plans just mentioned .
secondly , our teachers or parents should not act as an authority , in@@ still their own ideas into students , case their own growth model onto him or regard children as their own private property , but let each of our children have room for their free growth .
we are only his companion , a guide , a participant on his road .
only in this way can our children truly become qualified talent , and can they truly become such people as we expect to be able to assume social responsibilities .
therefore , I hope that parents will leave here today with the awareness that students and talents are not made through cultivation , or in@@ cul@@ c@@ ated . parents need to grow up together with children .
learn to be a parent and give your children their freedom , then you will be a successful parent .
thank you and wish you all the best .
today is a weekend , a day suitable to have some form of entertainment .
before I came here , I did a small @-@ scale survey .
I asked 100 friends who wouldn &apos;t go straight home about their plans tonight .
60 people told me that they would look for something delicious to eat , in other words 60 f@@ oo@@ dies ; the remaining 40 people told me that they would go somewhere to entertain their eyes and ears .
not a single one of them ever told me that he or she would smell something pleasant .
the results explain one thing that we human beings nowadays could hardly obtain sensory enter@@ tain@@ ments through smells .
in fact , we all know that animals have a super acute sense of smell .
a queen bee rules a gigantic bee kingdom and its sole way of ruling is the special scent it gives off .
a kid is walking around on a lawn and finds a straight line of ants heading directly to the food far away , but how do these ants know the whereabouts of the food ?
it &apos;s because of the smell left by the ants who have found the food in the first place .
one of most amazing animal is the ch@@ um salmon .
they lay eggs in Heilongjiang River .
when a school of baby fish is born , they will swim down the stream and eventually enter the sea .
after four years , quite a long period of time , the grown @-@ up sal@@ mons will swim against the current , trying to return back to their birthplace .
how far will they swim ?
thousands of kilometers , and they can still accurately find the exact location of their birthplace .
but with what ?
with the scent !
how amazing !
we know that most mammals rely on their sense of smell to direct their actions , including emitting od@@ ors to attract the opposite sex , rather than by tex@@ ting or t@@ wee@@ ting .
in other words , giving off a scent is designed to attract the opposite sex .
they will demarc@@ ate their home ranges through def@@ ec@@ ation or ur@@ ination , to advertise their territory and to warn intr@@ ud@@ ers .
animals &apos; sense of smell is rather well @-@ developed by now .
but as we know , at the early stage of human evolution , human beings also had an extraordinary sense of smell .
but with the progress of civilization and science and technology , image technology has posed a great challenge to our vision ; sound processing technology poses a great challenge to our hearing ; a wide variety of flavors and spices pose a great challenge to our sense of smell ; and countless of food additives pose a great challenge to our sense of taste .
this is of great danger .
why ?
because the ability to sense , the ability to feel , does not only bring us a kind of entertainment and enjoyment , it is also closely related to our emotions , closely related to our health , and even closely related to our intelligence .
among all these senses , the sense of smell is probably the most de@@ generated one .
but even so , the sense of smell is still closely related to our daily life .
I guess not everyone is clear about the fact that no matter how many showers you take , like 10 or 100 times a day , your body will still send out your exclusive scent , which is as unique as your fingerprints .
and the scent is the most decisive factor for you to choose your sexual partner .
many of us are not aware that you are in love with someone simply because you love his or her body scent .
in addition , we find out the sc@@ ents of all women will remain almost consistent throughout their whole lives .
what is the decisive factor behind this phenomenon ?
it &apos;s decided by a woman &apos;s genes .
it was particularly interesting that her body odor would change once only at a special stage , and when is that ?
it &apos;s when she is pregnant , as the scent of her body is mixed with the newborn &apos;s , how amazing it is !
speaking of babies , they are all born with an exceptional ability to recognize their mother &apos;s scent .
that &apos;s why a baby will cry immediately in other people &apos;s hands and become peaceful soon in his or her mother &apos;s arms .
because he or she knows that they are back with their mothers again .
the research findings show that the scent is closely related to three areas in our brain .
what &apos;s the first area ?
it &apos;s an area associated with memory .
the second area ?
the area associated with emotions .
how about the third area ?
as I mentioned just now , it is the lust .
it &apos;s the area associated with sexual impulses .
in conclusion , compared with all other senses , the sense of smell is the most delicate , as well as the most neglected and most de@@ generated one among all senses .
we Chinese people always use a term &quot; people with the same scent are con@@ genial to each other &quot; or &quot; people who share the same rotten smells are drawn to each other &quot; when talking about sc@@ ents .
my studies found out that these terms are either commend@@ atory or derog@@ atory when used at different historical periods .
so what is the exact meaning of the term &quot; people with the same scent are con@@ genial to each other &quot; ?
Napoleon , the famous strategist and politician of the First French Empire , spent a whole year out on the battle@@ fields .
every time before he went home after a battle , he would write to his wife Jos@@ eph@@ ine , saying , &quot; My love , I know it &apos;s August and it &apos;s very hot , but don &apos;t bathe from today until I &apos;m back . &quot;
why ?
because he was so obsessed with Jos@@ eph@@ ine &apos;s body odor .
there is an American man named Ke@@ ev@@ ill , whose look is very un@@ attractive and not as handsome as me for sure , is a ladies &apos; man and is always surrounded by pretty girls .
his male friends are confused about his popularity among women .
someone asked one of Ke@@ ev@@ ill &apos;s closest female friends , and she explained that she only had a crush on Ke@@ ev@@ ill because she loved the honey sweet @-@ sc@@ ented smell of his body .
when talking about smells , I &apos;d like to introduce a tradition in England in the 17th century .
what was this tradition in rural England in the 17th century ?
if a girl went for a blind date , say , she wanted to see a boy at 3 : 30 pm Saturday afternoon , what would she do beforehand ?
she must peel an apple at 2 : 30 pm , one hour before the date , and then put it under her arm@@ pit .
why arm@@ pit ?
there are three parts in our body that produces the strongest odor , which are the arm@@ pits , the chest , and the lower abdomen .
the odor from the arm@@ pit is the strongest .
the girl would put the pe@@ eled apple under her arm@@ pit for one hour .
when she met the boy , she would give him the apple and invite him to smell it .
if the boy loved the smell on the apple , he was certain that she was his Miss Right .
but if the boy frow@@ ned and disliked the smell , it was very unlikely that their relation would last long .
I told my good friend Ms. Wu Di , the &quot; S@@ pic@@ y Love Coun@@ sel@@ or , &quot; that before going to her match@@ making events , all girls should peel an apple and put it under their arm@@ pits .
when the boys come , girls will put the apples on the table and leave .
the boys will smell the apples one by one .
once they find their favorite smells , the apple owners will show up .
the match@@ making odds would be very high , as the two will be together for the love of smells rather than for love itself .
that &apos;s why we say smells are closely related to our daily life .
Helen F@@ is@@ cher , a famous anthropol@@ og@@ ist from the US , says that she has done researches on con@@ genial sc@@ ents for many years .
according to Helen , if you like someone &apos;s smell , you will be in love naturally with the person ; if not , you will refuse the relationship .
after many years of researches , the Swedish scientists believe that when human beings are selecting the opposite @-@ sex spouse , he or she will instinctively let the gender @-@ specific odor molecules stimulate the sexuality @-@ driven area of the brain to arouse sex impulse .
this conclusion agrees with the theory that I have mentioned before .
scientists from the University of Chicago have a very interesting conclusion after many years of studies .
what did they find ?
it &apos;s quite meaningful to girls .
they found out that a girl f@@ ancies the body scent of a particular man for a reason , what is that ?
this man is the most genetically similar to the woman &apos;s father .
interesting , isn &apos;t it ?
you like the smell of that boy because one of his genes is the most consistent with your father &apos;s .
what is the research result from scientists in Brown University ?
it &apos;s interesting too .
they think the smells of men are closely connected with their immunity systems .
a healthy man will naturally give out good smells .
so after millions of years of hered@@ ity , when a woman selects a man , she will instinctively select someone with a strong immunity system , to make sure she will have healthy off@@ springs .
that &apos;s why we say smells are closely related to &quot; sex . &quot;
moreover , smell is also connected to our emotions , memories and regional cultures .
what do British scientists discover after they have carried out brain scanning ?
people with the same cultural background or from the same country always have the same feelings towards a certain scent , despite that the degree varies from person to person .
British and Europeans have different preference on smells compared with Asian people , or with Chinese people .
why is that so ?
because smells are closely associated with our memories .
a smell is usually linked to a certain image , a person or a story in your brain .
so smell can serve as a strong emotional symbol .
the reason why you like the sweet fragrance is because there was once an os@@ man@@ thus tree in front of your house when you were a child .
you like the smell of b@@ raised pork because it &apos;s your mother &apos;s signature dish .
when a man returns to the old town where he was away from since 50 years ago , a slight smell of the stin@@ ky tofu in the air may move him to tears .
so sc@@ ents are probably the key to our past memories .
once we smell a certain scent , the old @-@ time memories will rush out and flood our minds .
that &apos;s why we say that those who like the same smell with you are probably genetically connected with you , and share something in common with you in terms of cultural background , memories and emotions .
please cherish your con@@ genial companions .
well , of course our pursuits or enjoyment of fine smells won &apos;t stop at the primary stage of appreciating the body odor of the opposite sex .
the internal odor is the most primitive part in a human body , but the external fragrance will greatly enhance our ol@@ factory pleasures .
in 1500 BC , Hat@@ shep@@ su@@ t , the only female phar@@ aoh in the history of Egypt , started a grand war .
this war has been engraved as mur@@ als on the walls of her tomb by her desc@@ end@@ ents .
what was the trigger of the war ?
just for grabbing Hat@@ shep@@ su@@ t &apos;s favorite spice .
after Alexander the Great had conquered Per@@ sia , a place rich in spices , he brought a massive amount of spices back to his palace and sprayed perfume across every corner of it , and fum@@ ig@@ ated his clothes with my@@ r@@ r@@ h .
Alexander the Great believed that when he smelled the fragrance , the de@@ ities would descend and bless him .
the Bible recorded that when Jesus Christ was born in Bethle@@ hem , the Three W@@ ise Men from the East , also referred to as Bi@@ blical Mag@@ i , offered him three gifts .
they were gold , frank@@ incense and my@@ r@@ r@@ h .
frank@@ incense and my@@ r@@ r@@ h are two most commonly used spices in western countries .
China &apos;s Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was extremely addicted to incense .
the interior and exterior of his palace were filled with smoke of burning incense all day long .
his ministers must wear sac@@ he@@ ts when meeting the Emperor , and regional governors , feudal princes and neighboring countries must present exotic inc@@ enses to Emperor Wu every year .
in the years of late Northern Song Dynasty , a man named Hong Chu wrote a book Xiang@@ pu ( Book of In@@ c@@ enses ) , docum@@ enting dozens of the most commonly used inc@@ enses in China at that time , the history of incense application , and the fabrication methods of compound inc@@ enses .
the book is a very important summary of Chinese incense culture .
the culture of incense has a long history and appears at all times both in China and around the world .
Chinese people have upli@@ fted the incense culture to the Tao@@ ism level , we call it incense lore .
the incense lore is prevailing these years .
in the eyes of Chinese people , incense is of strong material and spiritual characteristics .
material characteristic @-@ wise , there are four very famous spices in ancient China , which are A@@ gar@@ wood , sand@@ al@@ wood , dragon fragrance and mus@@ k .
A@@ gar@@ wood is the mixture of resin , gum , volatile oil and wood of A@@ gar@@ wood trees . its composition is very complicated .
sand@@ al@@ wood is the wood of sand@@ al trees .
dragon fragrance refers to am@@ ber@@ gr@@ is formed in the digestive system of sperm whales , or the resin of cam@@ ph@@ or trees .
mus@@ k is from the mus@@ k deer .
these are all amazing creations of the nature , you can tell just from their names .
in the meantime they are very precious medicinal materials .
it &apos;s relatively easy for us to describe the tastes in our months .
sour , sweet , bitter , spicy , salty .
but when it comes to smells , it &apos;s quite rough for us to simply define them as only frag@@ ran@@ ces and re@@ eks .
fragrance always turns out to be abstract and unpredictable , and in@@ constantly appears in mysterious forms , yet subtle for the short @-@ tempered .
fragrance tra@@ verses from our souls to the wise minds in the outer world .
so we regard fragrance as a very classical spiritual symbol .
frag@@ ran@@ ces can help people keep healthy and treat illnesses .
the fragrance therapy , originated from ancient Egypt , is now popular worldwide .
many girls know that French people have extracted over 400 kinds of essential oils from various plants , and some 40 types are very commonly used now .
China also has a long tradition of fragrance therapy .
traditional Chinese Medicine believes frag@@ ran@@ ces can enter human body via no@@ str@@ ils , mouth and pores to help regulate organ functions and get rid of illnesses to achieve an internal balance .
frag@@ ran@@ ces can soothe the nerves .
the A@@ gar@@ wood I mentioned before and the essential oil of lav@@ ender are very effective to calm people down .
the modern society is filled with anxiety , which can be seen among well @-@ educated people and factory workers alike .
how can we get rid of anxiety and nerves ?
the nurturing of inner peace is the fundamental solution .
it would be helpful to use the frag@@ ran@@ ces .
fragrance is also associated with religions .
ancient people regarded the fragrance of spice , since its appearance , as the very medium connecting human beings with the de@@ ities .
the use of spices showed human beings &apos; reverence towards de@@ ities .
in almost all religions , including Christianity , Cathol@@ icism , Buddhism , Tao@@ ism and Islam@@ ism , A@@ gar@@ wood is regarded as a precious holy item .
fragrance is closely associated with religions .
in ancient Rome , the Romans believed that the whole city of Rome would succum@@ b to hell if they stopped wor@@ shipping Go@@ dd@@ esses by burning incense .
Tao@@ ism believes the de@@ ities only take in the smells of burning incense rather than mortal &apos;s food .
the incense culture is a prevailing symbol of elite culture since ancient times in China .
ancient China &apos;s liter@@ ati considered incense burning , together with flower arranging , tea brewing and painting appreciation , as &quot; Four Arts of Life . &quot;
influenced by China , Japan also has a long history of incense lore .
ko@@ do ( incense burning ) , K@@ ado ( flower arrangement ) and s@@ ado ( tea ceremony ) are Japan &apos;s Three Cultural Arts .
different from the civilian @-@ friendly K@@ ado and s@@ ado , ko@@ do has long been a symbol of the life of Japanese noble class .
people today like perfume , an inevitable thing when talking about fragrance .
spraying perfume is just like wearing a s@@ ach@@ et in ancient China .
every civilian , though not being in noble class , has the equal right to pursue fragrance .
many Shanghai people might still remember that , a few decades ago , the beautiful ladies there never gave up pursuing fragrance despite different restrictions in the society .
they sprayed floral water and adorned themselves with magn@@ ol@@ ia blossoms as their new @-@ style sac@@ he@@ ts .
we could often hear the familiar pe@@ dd@@ ling voice in the alle@@ y@@ ways that time , what were they selling ?
garden@@ ia and magn@@ ol@@ ia blossoms .
decades have passed , but till now it is still an integral part of Shanghai &apos;s native culture .
what exactly is the incense lore ?
Chinese people say the incense lore is the lore of harmony , which harmon@@ izes our hearts and bodies , our bodies and the nature .
incense lore is the lore of reverence , delivering our reverence towards the nature , the universe and de@@ ities .
incense lore is the lore of cleansing , cleansing all our un@@ connected external things .
incense lore is the lore of serenity , calming us down and gives us tranqu@@ ility .
incense lore is the lore of the universe .
we take a bath , put on clean clothes , burn a piece of incense and sit still in our humble room .
we calm ourselves down , get rid of all burdens , and integrate our souls , bodies and the universe into one harmonious entity .
now the incense lore is the universe lore !
incense lore is also the lore of persons .
I said just now that with the help of external fragrance , human beings will step over the primary stage of appreciating body odor .
the uti@@ lit@@ arianism exists in the process of friends making .
classmates who haven &apos;t seen each other for 20 years are busy exchanging business cards once they meet again , while considering whether their classmate can get his son into a prestigious kindergarten .
this is a fair @-@ weather friend .
do you have any friends that favor the same scent as you do ?
go home tonight and look them up in your address book to check out how many con@@ genial friends you have .
in an early @-@ autumn evening , please invite some of your con@@ genial friends to sit by the flowers under the moonlight .
make some tea , burn a piece of A@@ gar@@ wood , and unle@@ ash the instincts that have been hidden in your souls for millions of years to appreciate the different frag@@ ran@@ ces of life , how delightful !
thank you !
workplace politics has always been a hot topic of the day .
we often talk about office politics under the context of state @-@ owned enterprises , but many of my friends have asked me , &quot; Do foreign companies not have to deal with workplace politics ? does power struggle not exist in foreign firms ? did Steve Jobs not be forced out of Apple after power tus@@ s@@ le with the company &apos;s board ? evidently , office power struggle is way more cut@@ throat in foreign companies than in state @-@ own ones , as people will go to any length to get what they want , even if it means to drive out a company founder . &quot;
I think workplace politics in foreign and private companies share one of the most basic premises , that is , the management serves the board of directors , who also own the company .
for company owners , the most important thing is profit , and secondly , you don &apos;t get into trouble and you don &apos;t break the law .
these are the premises and rules that dictate workplace politics in foreign companies .
however , the situation is different in state @-@ owned enterprises , because the management answers to government departments , such as the State @-@ owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commissi@@ on@@ of the State Council .
a government department cares not only about profitability but also whether the company will promote social harmony and stability , create employment opportunities , especially for the government leaders &apos; distant relatives .
that &apos;s why office politics is more intricate in SO@@ Es .
therefore , office politics in foreign @-@ invested enterprises is utterly different from that in state @-@ owned enterprises , due to the difference in ownership .
Chinese people are not interested in fighting , as it is always associated with shady , dirty and sne@@ aky tactics .
the Chinese language has phrases like &quot; fight with open and secret means &quot; and &quot; watching from a hill@@ top while two tigers fight , &quot; which describe the fight as a low class and ing@@ lor@@ ious act .
on the contrary , Chinese believe in the her@@ mit @-@ type life philosophy that advises people to endure , compromise , be worldly @-@ wise and keep themselves from incur@@ ring troubles , instead of standing up for themselves .
Chinese often talk about &quot; one who restr@@ ains himself lives a safe life , &quot; &quot; take a little step back , and you will find more space around you &quot; and things like that .
some people even hang poems about endurance on the walls of their studies , to advertise their wisdom .
however , such a philosophy of for@@ bear@@ ance and compromise goes against the very essence of modern corporate culture .
in modern business culture , we need professionals .
what &apos;s the definition of a professional ?
you may think that you get all your work done , then you are a professional .
to me , this kind of thinking is somewhat n@@ a@@ ï@@ ve .
a professional must be able to do his or her job and do it well .
that &apos;s the bottom line .
more importantly , a professional should be brave enough to fight for the chance to showcase his or her abilities .
if you don &apos;t have the guts to fight for your job , you will very likely be thrown off the stage without ever having the opportunity to shine .
a professional should be competent for the job , dare to fight for the chance to do the job and can negotiate the deserving benefits for getting the job well done .
if a person fails in any of the three aspects , he or she would be considered as lacking the overall skill@@ set by the boss .
here , I want to clarify some misunderstandings people have about office politics .
a common misunderstanding is that non @-@ ad@@ min staffs need not get involved in workplace politics .
this is a simple notion which is common among the diligent workers in a company .
these people are under the impression that they will be safe in the office as long as they finish their work and steer clear of the power struggles .
they just want to mind their own businesses , and stay away from other people &apos;s .
however , many of those hard @-@ working people complain about their jobs , why is that ?
despite their competence , the job is assigned to someone with lesser abilities but good at office politics .
moreover , the diligent workers are being asked to do assistant work .
soon , they begin to feel un@@ recognized and un@@ appreciated in the company .
I find it to be peculiar that since you think you have outstanding business abilities , why not fight for a chance to shine ?
why don &apos;t you ask for a stage to showcase your abilities ?
I want to share an example of a respectable woman .
she &apos;s an advertisement copy@@ writer from &quot; M@@ ad Man , &quot; the American TV drama we just watched .
this woman was a secretary in the 1960s in the United States . at that time , gender discrimination was rampant in workplaces , as a result , many females were only able to get junior positions such as secretaries .
as a secretary , this talented woman came up with a brilliant advertisement idea , with which , she won the client over .
did she receive a promotion or salary bump for her amazing performance ?
no .
this is normal , because every boss is selfish .
if I pay you the salary of a secretary , you will do the job as a copy@@ writer .
what a great bargain for the company !
however , this woman was not willing to accept the status quo .
she talked to her boss and laid down two requests : first , the company should recognize her as a copy@@ writer ; and second , she must have her own office like the others .
her demands were granted .
we can make a bold assumption that if she did not propose those requests , continued to work as a secretary at a desk in front of the boss &apos; office , and got paid the secretary &apos;s salary , how would she feel about her job ?
she must feel un@@ recognized and resent the current situation .
would she continue to bring forth remarkable advertisement ideas ?
her talent would be wasted , and her resentment would suppress her creative passion .
had she not fight for her own interest , her creativity would have been quen@@ ched , and her company would have lost an excellent advertisement idea , which would have been a lose @-@ lose situation .
the lesson we can draw from this example is that it would be beneficial to the company , if an employee is good at standing up for his or her interest and fighting for his or her job .
another common misunderstanding of office politics is the notion that getting the job title is the same as getting real power , which is also silly and n@@ a@@ ï@@ ve .
we have met people who are the general managers , presidents , and directors of their companies .
as we started to learn more about them , we found out that they have no say in human resources or finance , they could not even accept a press interview because the headquarters would not allow them to express any opinions on the media .
they can only distribute the press releases prepared by the headquarters , without further elaboration on the matter .
these people may hold the title of a general manager , but in fact , they are doing the work of a regular business manager .
this situation can be found everywhere .
I want to tell you something similar in the fashion magazine industry , a business I &apos;m very familiar with .
when you look at the stunning magazine covers , have you ever wondered who makes the call of the photo ?
who decides on which female star or super@@ model to be featured on the cover ?
you may say : &quot; it &apos;s the chief editor . &quot;
or some people would think it &apos;s the editor .
it turns out that the chief editors don &apos;t have the power to oversee the cover shoot .
someone from a higher level would say to them : &quot; I don &apos;t think you can handle this . let me do it for you . &quot;
but the problem is , if you use the cover made by your superi@@ ors , then who is it to blame when the magazine doesn &apos;t sell ?
of course , the chief editors are the ones to take the fall , because this is the responsibility that comes with the job title .
you may argue : &quot; I didn &apos;t shoot the cover , why am I the one to blame ? &quot;
then the general manager might say : &quot; why don &apos;t you fight for your power as the chief editor ? &quot;
if you go on saying that you have been treated un@@ fairly in the whole process , your boss would consider you as lacking the overall abilities .
you are the one to blame for not fighting for the power that comes with your job title .
the power struggle between movie director Zhang Y@@ im@@ ou and investor Zhang Wei@@ ping has also made the headlines recently .
as the chief director , Zhang Y@@ im@@ ou felt unfair to be forced to add a sex scene in the movie by the investor , which he didn &apos;t want in the first place .
the power struggle is about a director &apos;s authority over a movie project , which is very complicated .
the power tus@@ s@@ le between directors and investors is universal .
the movie producers want the project to make more money , but the director &apos;s job is to guarantee that the mon@@ e@@ tization process does not compromise the quality of the work .
as the person in charge of the project , you should be able to minimize other parties &apos; interference on your work ; otherwise , you don &apos;t have operational capabilities to execute the project .
this is the second misunderstanding I want to clarify .
the third misunderstanding is the perception that every office power struggle is under the table , not on the table .
I need to cite the examples from the hit palace drama &quot; Em@@ presses in the Palace &quot;
in the show , all the concub@@ ines cared about were who got to sleep with the emperor more and who was able to get rid of the babies from other pregnant concub@@ ines .
they always said : &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter whether you have done the evil deeds or not , as long as the emperor believes you are innocent . &quot;
that is the typical ecology under the rule of man : there are no clear strategies , only conspiracy , because the only rule is that there are no rules .
human beings are emotional and unstable .
if you implement rules based on your preferences , then you leave other people no choice but to fight dirty .
therefore , what we advocate here is for everyone to compete openly .
we are pleased to see that many tactics of office politics are out in the open in China , such as the earlier internal power struggle in G@@ ome and the fight between Wa@@ ha@@ ha and Dan@@ one .
some may say there are still conspir@@ acies between the power tus@@ s@@ le in companies .
I will admit that there is still room for improvement in corporate regulations and systems , which will be refined through workplace power struggles .
as a result , companies can have a more open , more systematic mechanism , which in return , will push forward social development .
the last misunderstanding I want to address is the idea that every power struggle is destructive , not constructive .
let &apos;s take a look at these two women : one of them is a NPC deputy , the other is a CPPCC representative .
a legisl@@ ator and a political advisor are two pretty important positions .
although these two jobs are not full @-@ time , at least they still count as part @-@ time professions .
these two women abide by the same principle : they don &apos;t abstain from voting ; they don &apos;t vote no ; they only cast the yes votes .
I was shocked upon hearing this .
I realized they had a rather easy job , which even my 3 @-@ year @-@ old daughter was competent enough to handle .
I could tell my daughter to sit still and raise her hand when everyone else is raising theirs .
I think they might have forgotten their responsibilities .
which are to be the voice of the people and to bring forth social advancement .
they have neglected their duties .
they are incompetent , and they should leave these posts .
the type of political struggle we have advocated in the workplace is that by standing up for ourselves , we can perfect the rules and take our fights out in the open .
an American friend once told me : &quot; you need to fight . you fight because you are right ! &quot;
I admire his attitude .
if each of us is brave enough to fight for what we believe is right , and put our thoughts on the table , we will find out that what I think is correct he believes it is wrong , and what I see as incorrect , he regards it as right .
after that , we pool our opinions together .
through communication and compromise , we refine the rule and respect the rights and beliefs of everyone , so that we can forge a better future for our company , our industry , and our society .
so are you prepared ?
you fight because you are right !
thank you very much !
first , please take a look at the pictures on the screen .
some pictures about parag@@ li@@ ding .
what are the first words that come to your mind at this point ?
cool , free !
yes , parag@@ li@@ ding is a sport that can set you free .
imagine that we are flying at an altitude of 1000 meters , when the blue sky and white clouds are at your back and below you is the vast expanse of the land .
at this time , I think you can imagine the feeling of flying high up in the sky .
my first contact with the parag@@ li@@ ding was due to one of my friends .
one day he called me and said , &quot; Zhu@@ o@@ huan , I &apos;m injured , and I &apos;m going to be discharged from the hospital today . could you come and give me a hand ? &quot;
so I went to J@@ ish@@ u@@ itan Hospital , the best orth@@ op@@ edi@@ c hospital in Beijing , to pick up my friend .
I saw him on cr@@ ut@@ ches with a leg in plaster .
my friend said that the accident took place when he was flying a parag@@ li@@ der .
when he tried to land , there wasn &apos;t enough height , and he had to make a forced landing in the mid@@ air .
then he fell to the asphalt road from five meters above , and broke a leg .
I was stunned when I heard the word of &quot; parag@@ li@@ ding , &quot; as I could never refuse such a fun sport !
so I rushed to sign up at a parag@@ li@@ ding club the next day .
the parag@@ li@@ ding club first gave us an initial training .
it was actually very simple , as we just learnt some basic knowledge of flying a parag@@ li@@ der .
in simple terms , a parag@@ li@@ der is made up of two pieces of cloth that are se@@ wn up above our head and a piece of cloth at the bottom to hold us , and all are linked with a few ropes .
among these ropes , there are two important ropes on the left and right side respectively that should be held tight in our hands , as they are used to control brakes .
their function is also very simple .
when I pull the left brake rope , the speed on the left will get slower , enabling me to turn left ; if I pull the right rope , I will turn right .
how time flies ! in the initial training process , we learnt the basic parag@@ li@@ ding skills mainly on the ground .
when I was about to finish my elementary courses , we went to a hill , a 50 @-@ meter @-@ high m@@ ound , to test parag@@ li@@ ding flight .
then we walked on the hill , spreading out the parag@@ li@@ der against the wind .
when there was wind blowing which is suitable for flying , we would pull up the parag@@ li@@ der and it would be lifted with the wind .
we had to make sure it was indeed on top of my head .
when the parag@@ li@@ der was on top of my head , I ran straight down the hill .
as I ran faster , the lift force generated by the winds got greater than my weight .
so I flew off the hillside probably halfway I ran .
I clearly remember that I didn &apos;t fly up high that time , only about five meters high , and I didn &apos;t fly long , presumably five seconds , but that was one of the most impressive parag@@ li@@ ding experiences in my life .
because I really experienced that my feet left the ground , I was flying , and I could control my flight .
after flying over the hill , the coach would take us to fly over the mountain .
and this time , we couldn &apos;t fly by ourselves , as we had to learn a lot of stuff in the air that we haven &apos;t known before .
for instance , he took us to M@@ ang Mountain in Beijing , parag@@ li@@ ding from 500 @-@ meter mountain@@ top .
in the air , he told me that the Ming Tom@@ bs Reservoir was just ahead , and there was massive turbulence over the hill on the right front and we should avoid it , take a det@@ our , and fly straight forward .
then looking further to the right , we saw a large lawn .
that was our landing site .
the coach flew with me once to help to acqu@@ aint me with the route , and finally landed on the destination .
afterwards , we will go for intermediate training , as my goal is to really fly up in the air , and the intermediate training will tell us some more fundamental flying knowledge .
for example , the air traffic rules .
if two gli@@ ders fly towards each other , how to avoid collision ?
very easy , pass on the right side .
in addition to the air traffic rules , what we need to learn is how to gain power while parag@@ li@@ ding .
we know that a parag@@ li@@ der doesn &apos;t generate power itself .
so in the process of flying , we can only rely on two air@@ flows to ensure we fly as high as we can .
the first is the dynamic air@@ flow .
what is the dynamic air@@ flow ?
that is wind as we usually say .
usually a wind blows horizontally .
but when it meets a hillside , the hillside will push the wind to go up .
at this time , if we fly above the hillside , we can imagine that the wind will blow us higher and higher .
this kind of air@@ flow is called dynamic air@@ flow .
another type of air@@ flow we can rely on is called thermal .
the principle of thermal is basically related to the fact of solar power heating the ground .
when the ground is heated by solar power , the surface temperature rises , pushing up the air temperature .
when the air expands with heat , it starts to rise .
when the air starts to rise , we will be lifted up by the thermal if we are parag@@ li@@ ding above it .
these are the two basic ways for parag@@ li@@ ders to be powered .
I can still remember that when I first took off from the M@@ ang Mountain , I flew higher and higher by means of the dynamic air@@ flow .
and when I overlooked the take @-@ off field , I was very excited and astonished , as I flew with the power of nature .
while enjoying freedom and happiness in the air , gli@@ ders must pay the most attention to avoid accidents .
there are two accidents that I can recall clearly .
one was man @-@ made misfortune , and the other was natural calamity .
the former accident happened in 1999 , and we called it the &quot; April 28th Accident . &quot;
that day , Mr. Gao Xing@@ z@@ he , a coach from Beijing Hu@@ alian Club , took off from the top of the M@@ ang Mountain near the Ming Tom@@ bs Reservoir , which is a common take @-@ off site for us .
after taking off , Mr. Gao made a decision .
as he was perhaps in a good mood , he hoped that he could fly a parag@@ li@@ der over the city of Beijing .
it happened to be the north wind blowing , so he kept flying south from the Ming Tom@@ bs Reservoir in the north of Beijing .
after flying over the fourth and the third ring roads , unfortunately he didn &apos;t have enough thermal to keep his height .
then he gradually descended , and it was only a few hundred meters above the ground when he flew into the second ring .
when he found himself only 200 meters high above the ground , he was just over the For@@ bidden City , and the only place that he could choose to land was Tian &apos;@@ anmen Square .
then he had no choice but to make a landing near the Mon@@ ument to the People &apos;s Her@@ oes in Tian &apos;@@ anmen Square .
once he fell to the Mon@@ ument to the People &apos;s Her@@ oes , he was immediately brought down by the policemen from all directions .
then it took him great efforts to explain to the police that he wasn &apos;t thrown away from the plane !
he also needed to explain to the police that he didn &apos;t hide the engine , as the policemen didn &apos;t believe he could fly from far away without power .
this parag@@ li@@ ding brought him a personal record .
he flew a total of two hours , with the maximum height of 3000 meters and the straight line distance of 50 kilometers .
with this record , Gao ended his flying career , because he was immediately banned for flying for life and was detained for 15 days , and at the meantime his parag@@ li@@ ding club was dis@@ b@@ anded .
though it is free to fly , it doesn &apos;t mean it has no boundary .
the second accident was caused by natural disasters .
it happened some time in 2007 in Australia , where a global parag@@ li@@ ding tournament was held .
halfway through the game , a dark cloud suddenly moved from a distance .
it was so dark , as it was very thick and thick enough to block all the sunlight .
a cum@@ ul@@ on@@ im@@ bus cloud is like a big vacuum cleaner that su@@ cks everything below it , so this kind of cloud often causes hazard when parag@@ li@@ ding .
if a parag@@ li@@ der is unfortunately caught by the cloud , it will be difficult to escape as the speed reaches 10 to 20 meters per second .
so when the cloud flew over , all the parag@@ li@@ ders chose to give up .
however , Eva from Germany and He from China still hoped to continue the game , as they didn &apos;t want to throw away their chance to win .
they hoped they could catch up with the fore@@ go@@ ers before the dark cloud arrives .
unfortunately , the dark cloud flew faster than they flew , and both of them were sucked into the cloud .
Eva was sucked up to a height of 10,000 meters at a speed of 20 meters per second and the temperature there was only about minus 50 degrees .
she was frozen and fain@@ ted during the ascent , and was thrown out of the dark cloud when she woke up .
with the height dropping and the temperature climbing , she slowly regained consciousness and manipulated the parag@@ li@@ der to land .
the following physical examination showed she only had minor fro@@ st@@ bite and no life @-@ threatening injuries .
however , He wasn &apos;t that lucky .
after he was sucked into a height of 6@@ 000 meters by the cum@@ ul@@ on@@ im@@ bus cloud , he was unfortunately struck by lightning and died on the spot .
why were they at risk ?
because they violated the rules .
the parag@@ li@@ ding rules clearly stipulate that first , you can only fly in the designated airspace ; secondly , don &apos;t fly under adverse weather conditions , especially when there are cum@@ ul@@ on@@ im@@ bus clouds , as they are very dangerous and often can be fatal .
parag@@ li@@ ding accidents occur every year , and most of them happen because gli@@ ders violate the rules of the flight .
in fact , rules exist in every aspect of our lives .
every time we prepare to enter a new sector or to do something new , we have to know its rules , and then we can devote ourselves into it and enjoy the freedom and happiness brought by it .
whether we enter a country or an industry , or just write a program or perform as an actor , we have to follow tons of rules .
for example , culturally speaking , it is natural for a child to call his father &apos;s name in the United States .
however , in the rural areas of northeast China , if a child d@@ ares to call his father &apos;s name , people may get very angry .
and if we are going to an Islamic country , some behaviors may even bring danger to our lives , if we are not informed of their culture in advance .
in life , we must abide by many such rules .
only by obe@@ ying the rules can we enjoy the happiness and freedom brought by the rules .
so what I want to say is that let us follow the rules to fly higher .
let us fly freely , and live with rules .
thank you .
everyone , good evening .
some people may wonder why a radio host like me would want to talk about drugs .
why am I so interested in drugs ?
the reason why I want to talk about drugs dates back to over a decade ago , when I was the host of a radio show &quot; With You T@@ ill D@@ awn . &quot;
on one late night , I received a call from a woman , whose son was 29 years old at that time .
her son had a decent job , but developed drug addic@@ tions under the bad influence of his so @-@ called friends .
her son sold everything the family had for drug money , dragging his family down with him .
in the end , he had no one else to turn to but his parents .
on the afternoon of the day she called me , her son came back and quarrel@@ ed with his father .
eventually , he beat the old man .
on that very evening , the old couple had a discussion .
the woman &apos;s husband said : &quot; we raised our un@@ filial son , and he will be a danger to the society . I should kill him . in this case , I will die with him , but our society will be better off without him . &quot;
the woman had to choose between her husband , the man she went through thick and thin with , and her son , her own flesh and blood .
it was impossible for the old lady to pick a side .
she knew that if she had chosen her son , he would beat his father to death in less than 6 months .
out of desperation , she thought of my show , picked up the phone and called me .
I was young at that time , and I considered everything either black or white .
I couldn &apos;t understand why people were like that .
how could people be interested in heroin and opium ?
how could they be so foolish ?
I can still remember the cry of that old woman , and it has haunted me for many years .
fast forward to the year 2007 , the radio station needed to make new programs .
I was thinking about whether I should take risks , walk a fine line and create a show that would benefit the society in some ways .
in the winter of 2007 , we launched China &apos;s very first anti @-@ drug radio show broadc@@ asted on a regular schedule .
please play the sound@@ track .
when I produced my first show , some officials from the Shanghai Municipal Narcotics Control Commission told me that , &quot; M@@ eng@@ xi@@ ao , I think you can do the show for 6 months , but not a year . &quot;
my show is still running , from the end of 2007 to now .
however , as I came in contact with police officers , social workers , drug addicts and traffickers , I was surprised to learn that even narcotics have advanced with the times .
people who make and sell drugs have also adopted innovation in their trade .
opium and heroin , the substances that were once dangerous to people have been replaced by something far more deadly : new synthetic drugs .
these new narcotics are known as ecstasy , happy water , ket@@ amine , meth@@ amp@@ het@@ amine , Mag@@ u , blue ench@@ ant@@ ress , forget @-@ me @-@ not and so on .
what these drugs are for ?
do people not try me@@ th out of curiosity ?
I don &apos;t want to do a raise @-@ your @-@ hand poll , because firstly , I cannot see you , and second , I have no doubt that there are people here who have tried it for the sake of curiosity .
some people may call me out , claiming that I have exaggerated the danger of drugs just to scare others .
they argued that drugs were like cigarettes , people were talking about the health hazard of tobacco , but still , there were many smokers out there .
they may be right about smokers , but new synthetic drugs are nothing like cigarettes .
I don &apos;t know if you remember , during the end of the previous year and the beginning of last year , there was a case of a Por@@ sche C@@ ay@@ en@@ ne hitting and killing 17 people in Hangzhou .
the perpetr@@ ator behind this was driving under the influence of drugs .
you might wonder why driving under the influence of narcotics can cause such a devastating outcome .
I want to share some stories from my interviews .
there was a boy from Shanghai , who came from a wealthy family .
his father was an excellent bureau @-@ director level official .
the boy had an easy life , and he even had his own business at a very young age .
everything was going well in his life .
somebody told him about something that can help him combat fatigue , as he was feeling tired after working overtime every day .
he had a motto that went : &quot; I have to complete three days of work in one day . &quot;
if my math isn &apos;t wrong , that will mean he wanted to turn 24 hours into 72 hours .
someone told him about something called &quot; ice skating , &quot; which would help with his problem .
what a nice name .
when I first heard of it , I thought it was roll@@ er@@ skating .
however , it was a type of drug .
without knowing anything about it , the boy tried the drug .
how many times one has to take a drug to become an addict varies from person to person .
some people might develop an addiction after trying the drug once , while others might take two years .
however , the question is , are you willing to risk it ?
are you dare to say you won &apos;t get addicted in two years ?
in the end , the boy became an addict .
he was arrested in a police operation targeting narcotics .
his father was on pins and needles .
I want to clarify that his father was an upright official , who has a great rap@@ port with other people .
he had retired when his son got caught using drugs .
the father begged for a chance to help his son get rid of the addiction at home , instead of going to the rehabilitation center .
as the old man would soon celebrate his 6@@ 3rd birthday .
the police chose to be len@@ ient , saying : &quot; alright , then you should go home and celebrate your dad &apos;s birthday . &quot;
on the night of the dad &apos;s birthday , the son had an auditory hall@@ uc@@ ination due to the drug addiction .
he thought that his father was the enemy who was coming to kill him , so he rushed into the kitchen , took a chop@@ ping knife and assa@@ ulted his father multiple times .
his father died on the day of his 6@@ 3rd birthday .
I want to talk about a patient I visited last week .
she is 30 years old , graduated from an elite university in Shanghai , maj@@ oring in foreign language studies .
a couple years after her graduation , she had to attend a lot of social activities every day .
at that time , she was working in a top 500 firm , and she had to hold many telephone conferences at night with people from the United States and Europe .
she started to feel less energetic and focused at night .
being an intro@@ vert , she found it awkward and embarrassing to communicate with foreigners , as she sometimes felt stuck convers@@ ing with them .
during that time , someone told her about a very effective weight @-@ loss pill .
every woman thinks they are over @-@ weight , nobody dis@@ likes being skinny .
and she was also told that taking the drug would make people more confident , and a lot of other people had taken it before .
still doubtful , the young lady tried the drug twice .
to her surprise , it worked amazingly , as she felt refreshed and concentrated at night .
ten months after , one day she was having dinner with her parents .
when she suddenly looked up and found that her mother turned into a v@@ ile and ferocious monster , she couldn &apos;t help but screaming , and the illusion disappeared .
her mother said : &quot; you may be too tired . &quot;
the young woman later found that she could not be alone in a room , or else , the little monsters would come out and whispered in her ears that : &quot; she is no longer your mother , and the monster has eaten her . she will kill your father if you don &apos;t stop her . &quot;
fortunately , this young lady was rational .
she thought she might suffer from some mental illness due to work stress .
she then went to see a doctor at the Shanghai Mental Health Center .
the doctor was professional .
after conducted some physical checks , no abnorm@@ alities were found in the indicators , and the young woman seemed to be mentally sane , then the doctor asked her : &quot; have you taken something unusual ? &quot;
&quot; no , everything is normal . &quot; the young lady responded .
the doctor went on asking her whether she had taken health supplements .
in retrospect , she told the doctor she had taken some pills ten months ago .
the doctor conducted tests on the pills and discovered its main ingredient was methyl@@ amp@@ het@@ amine , also known as me@@ th .
to be honest , she was not good @-@ looking during her first interview with me .
however , I remembered she was elegant and pretty when I looked at her previous photos .
why is that ?
because she had to take horm@@ onal and anti @-@ de@@ pressive drugs to suppress her hall@@ uc@@ inations .
her doctor told me : &quot; she can no longer be what she was before she took the pills . &quot;
what exactly are new synthetic drugs ?
opium and heroin , to put them in common saying , are green , as they are extracted from plants .
however , those new drugs are chem@@ ically synthesized , which directly affect the central nervous system .
once you take them , the drugs will start damaging your body bit by bit , until it collapses .
some of my friends asked me : &quot; is it that easy to get your hands on drugs ? why don &apos;t I see anyone selling and using drugs ? &quot;
that &apos;s because we haven &apos;t been paying enough attention .
in June , Shandong province has cracked the largest case to date , in which the criminal used Con@@ ta@@ c to make narcotics .
cont@@ ac is a common drug for cold , right ?
when you go to the pharmacy now , you can only buy two boxes at a time .
why is that ?
because one of Con@@ ta@@ c &apos;s ingredients , ephedrine , is a meth@@ amp@@ het@@ amine an@@ alogue . therefore , a sne@@ aky criminal gang stock@@ piled the anti @-@ cold pills for the illicit manufacture of me@@ th .
I was puzzled at that time , as Con@@ ta@@ c was not an affordable drug to come by , how would the drug makers profit from that ?
the police officers later explained to me that the substance extracted from every 180 yuan of Con@@ ta@@ c could be sold for up to 500 yuan .
the temptation of exor@@ bit@@ ant profit .
currently , more and more drug @-@ selling and profit @-@ seeking criminal are having their eyes fix@@ ated on people just like our audience , why ?
that &apos;s because many of you are professionals , white @-@ collar workers , and even the el@@ ites , who are under immense work @-@ related pressure and have to deal with many problems in life .
and this type of people are often well @-@ educated , with a little arrogance .
they tend to believe they have self @-@ control and strong will power , and that they can resist being addicted to drugs .
when something has become a trend in your social circle , a symbol of fashion , you will come to know it at a certain moment .
on Monday , I visited a correc@@ tional institution in Shanghai and interviewed a person going through mandatory drug rehabilitation , who used to be an outstanding dancer .
I asked him : &quot; why did you start to use drugs ? &quot;
he said : &quot; M@@ eng@@ xi@@ ao , if you were me , you would do the same . at a social gathering with a do@@ z@@ on of people , when everyone else was taking the drug , you could only refuse once or twice . if you say no for the third time , you would be crossed off the guest list , because you were a wi@@ er@@ do in their eyes .
&quot; the drug would bring me inspir@@ ations , and keep me excited . &quot; he added .
well , that &apos;s precisely the next point I come to tell you which is about the harm@@ fulness of new synthetic drugs .
it is the most direct and common channel for spreading AIDS .
in the past , people contracted AIDS through injection of heroin and opium , and this kind of circulation was between addicts .
but now , what &apos;s like to take new synthetic drugs ?
they stimulate excitement .
that &apos;s why we would see people shaking their heads in the dance floor after taking ecst@@ as@@ ies , or as our host put it , getting high .
so , when somebody proposes to take some trendy drugs at a party or a social event , it would very likely lead to collective for@@ n@@ ication , which ultimately , would facilitate the spread of AIDS .
the reason why I &apos;m here today to share with you these heart @-@ w@@ ren@@ ching stories is that I &apos;m afraid that one day , for whatever reasons , my friends and family could lose their lives to drugs .
I don &apos;t think that will be the outcome you the audience and I want to face .
I don &apos;t expect to persuade you with everything I just said in 20 minutes .
you may still have doubts , and that &apos;s alright .
but starting from this moment , you should know that there is something sinister in the world .
it has been lur@@ king around us , and its name is new synthetic drug .
it can be disguised as cold medicine or even as health supplement pills .
I have two pieces of advice for you .
first , don &apos;t purchase any questionable products through the Internet or word @-@ of @-@ mouth , no matter how effective they can be in making a man strong and a woman beautiful .
second , when you ever feel lonely and upset , and you don &apos;t have a friend to talk to , please dial this number : 6@@ 27@@ 80@@ 7@@ 92 .
a phone call might be useless , or it might just be the thing that saves your life .
thank you for sharing , thank you all .
good evening , my friends .
you must be very curious , why am I standing here on the stage dressed like this today ?
I think you have already begun to anticipate what I have to say .
what kinds of special stories will I tell you tonight ?
because of the uniqueness of my clothes and the clothes behind me , I think I have already presented you my first business card .
yes , I am a collector of traditional Chinese hand@@ crafts and traditional Chinese clothing .
over the years , I have conducted many collection and preservation works .
the more I have looked into the traditional Chinese clothing culture , the more I come to realize why China is called a state of ceremonies in history .
it is largely due to China &apos;s long @-@ established clothing culture .
the Book of Changes said that the Yellow Emperor and Em@@ per@@ ors Yao and Shu@@ n hung down their clothes and governed the country .
all of us here are well @-@ dressed , and we are like @-@ minded fellows .
clothing is not only our first business card , at the same time , it also plays a dominant role in self @-@ identification .
it has exerted a far @-@ reaching impact on human culture .
now I invite you to take a look at this picture .
without me saying anything , you must have already known who she is , as this lady is dressed splen@@ di@@ dly and ost@@ ent@@ ati@@ ously .
that &apos;s right , She is Wang Xi@@ feng .
at the R@@ ong and Ning Man@@ sions , I believe Wang Xi@@ feng is the most daring woman who is not afraid to ex@@ hib@@ ite her stunning beauty ; and there is no other woman like her , who is arrogant and dom@@ ine@@ ering .
as the comment goes , she is &quot; a heroine among a crowd of women . &quot;
then , what is the relationship between clothing and people , or society as a whole ?
let &apos;s start with the status of clothing in Chinese history .
the rudi@@ ment of China &apos;s ritual costume system was first established in the Shang Dynasty in the 16th century B.@@ C .
in the 11th century B.@@ C. , the Western Zhou Dynasty replaced the Shang Dynasty .
everybody has heard of the R@@ it@@ ual of Zhou .
the R@@ it@@ ual of Zhou had developed a very sophisticated and systematic ritual costume system .
in the Zhou Dynasty , there was even an official position called Si Fu , which was responsible for the dress etiquette of emper@@ ors and no@@ bles .
since then , successive dynasties all had precise and strict provisions on ritual costume dressing code .
as we can see in this picture , the crown is on the left and the dress on the right .
in the upper right corner of this crown , you can see the appreciation seal of Emperor Qi@@ an@@ long .
yes , this is the Imperial R@@ it@@ ual Vessels Diag@@ ram .
the Imperial R@@ it@@ ual Vessels Diag@@ ram serves as an extremely important sample for imperial ritual vessels .
it was taken as a loo@@ t to the overseas market due to the invasion of the Eight @-@ Power Al@@ lied Forces at end of the Qing Dynasty .
let &apos;s look at the next picture , which is also from the Imperial R@@ it@@ ual Vessels Diag@@ ram .
the bronze ware on the left is called Gu@@ i , while the ritual vessels on the right is B@@ ian D@@ ou , which was made of bamboo .
thus it can be seen that up until the Qing Dynasty , the crown , dress , and bronze wares and ritual vessels that were used in temple sacrifice activities , were of equal social and political importance .
in the Qing Dynasty , the color yellow was the ex@@ lu@@ sive color for the emperor .
the ornam@@ entation of a golden dragon with five claws must be bestowed upon the government officials by the emperor , and only officers from the first to the fifth grade were allowed to use the ornam@@ entation of a golden dragon with five claws , bestowed by the emperor .
it is thus clear that hierarchy of status based on costumes has always been an important part of the political and cultural life of our country from the slave society to the feudal society .
then I will tell you two more stories about the clothing system , which both took place in Wei Jin Southern and Northern dynasties .
Wei Jin Southern and Northern dynasties were a time full of legends , so we are sure to come up with many interesting stories .
the first story I will share took place in the Western Jin Dynasty .
the king of the Western Jin Dynasty hated merchants so much that he ordered merchants to wear only one black shoe and one white shoe to go out .
I think it &apos;s hard for you to imagine , at that time , let &apos;s imagine , at downtown markets in Western Jin Dynasty , merchants were trading goods , wearing one black shoe and one white shoe .
if this scene occurs at present time , I think it might still be a fashion .
but back that time , it was an open humiliation !
the second story I will tell you is about profound scholars in the Wei Jin period .
what kind of people do you think of when scholars in the Wei Jin period come to mind ?
yes , the Seven S@@ ages of the Bam@@ boo Gro@@ ve .
their clothes tend to be more elegant , casual and un@@ restrained .
and there were even bare @-@ ch@@ ested cases .
you will wonder why ?
in those days , as wars raged and regimes changed , these intellectuals were unable to fulfil their political ambitions .
as being extremely disappointed at politics , they had developed another hobbies , namely discussing metap@@ hysics , practicing al@@ chem@@ y and taking pel@@ let medicine .
at that time , there was a famous medicine called five minerals powder , the main component of which was various heavy metals .
when people take this five minerals powder , it will make them feel more excited .
while its side effect is feeling hot and dry , as well as cracked skin .
we can see that these scholars always gathered together and chat@@ ted in shady places at ordinary times .
they wore old and loose clothes .
why ?
old clothes did not irrit@@ ate the skin , so they didn &apos;t feel painful .
and open garments were conducive to the diffusion of the five minerals powder .
people next to them saw it and said : &quot; they really have celebr@@ aty @-@ like manners . &quot;
therefore , the social and political backgrounds in different times will form an unique aesthetic trend .
we are what we wear .
everyone knows this person , Y@@ ay@@ oi K@@ us@@ ama , the queen of dot .
on my right is Mr. D@@ ali .
the way they dress is a constant reminder of their identities as artists .
this is the famous former head of Di@@ or - G@@ alli@@ ano .
G@@ alli@@ ano is always so ma@@ ver@@ ick .
so clothing is especially important for self @-@ identity !
today I am standing here , at this very moment , in this rostrum , dressed in traditional Han costume .
but I can still feel that the information from the distant time and space more than two thousand years ago overl@@ aps with the information of this time and space .
at this moment , my sense of identity to the traditional Chinese culture is particularly strong .
as a collector of traditional clothes , I think this is the charm of traditional clothing .
it can travel across the barriers of time and space , and still bring us different feelings today .
let &apos;s say in order to spice up our life , we can wear different styles of clothes .
we behave the way we dress , and we can dress so viv@@ aciously or so rigor@@ ously .
therefore , we should not set our own limits in a time when there is no such thing as ritual costume system .
let the dress make our life become more beautiful !
let &apos;s travel freely through time and space .
but then again , in this day and age , can we really wear whatever we want ?
of course not .
people are social animals , and are faced with many social situations .
every social occasion has a certain etiquette , and the most basic principle of this etiquette is dressing for occasion .
we can conclude dressing for occasion into a 5@@ W rule , namely when ， where ， who ， what ， why .
dressing appropriately is not only a gesture of respect to others , but also a basic and essential skill for us to integrate into society and participate in various social occasions .
I see everyone here is wearing western @-@ style clothes , and we have to wear a hat to go with the clothes .
Ho @-@ ho , yes .
anyone here is wearing trad@@ it@@ onal Chinese clothes , please raise your hands .
it seems we have someone over here .
the lady in front of us , please stand up .
this is a modified traditional Han costume , called swallow coming back .
the pointed hem is very beautiful .
I can now give you a live demonstration .
I take out a cloth and I can cut out a Chinese dress with only two cuts .
because our Chinese clothing is flat , while two @-@ dimensional aesthetic pays attention to the sense of line .
I &apos;m going to invite my assistant up now .
give everyone a salute .
this is a piece of cloth , which has been double folded .
because this piece of cloth is very big , It has already been double folded .
OK , I will fold this cloth in half again now .
please hold this side for me .
all right .
watch carefully , I will cut the cloth only twice .
come here and turn this over .
good .
this is the first cut , and then I will cut the second time .
good , now let &apos;s unfold it .
this is a basic appearance of ori@@ ental garment .
put it on .
is silhou@@ ette of this clothes the same as mine ?
cut the front open , and then make the clothes edges .
it now becomes a complete garment .
and what is the aesthetic standard for western clothing ?
according to western dress aesthetics , a flat piece of cloth will be shattered into pieces and then , based on the principles of human anatomy , will be re@@ assembled into a three @-@ dimensional human form .
so , the aesthetics of eastern and western cultures are derived from two different aesthetic systems .
this is a image of Maggie Cheung in movie In the M@@ ood for Love .
Maggie Cheung has c@@ asted in many modern films , but her image in movie In the M@@ ood for Love , wearing a che@@ ong@@ sam , is the most impressive .
it is said that she had changed 33 pieces of che@@ ong@@ sam in this movie .
so I say , the charm of our traditional Chinese dress is extraordinary .
the integration of eastern and western cultures , I think , is truly the future development direction of traditional culture .
what one might ask , is the significance of preserving traditional crafts and clothing ?
I think , since the Revolution of 19@@ 11 , handicraft civilization has been gradually replaced by industrial civilization in China . and great changes have taken place in our way of life .
while we rejoice in our increasingly convenient way of life , have we considered that the things that truly move our hearts are becoming increasingly scarce ?
handicraft art , which is full of warm feelings and touching stories , has now become a wil@@ dest dream .
I think in the era of handicraft civilization , what we pursued was infinite standardization , just like royal kiln por@@ cel@@ ains from Jing@@ de@@ zhen and garments woven in Jiang@@ ning , which were extremely neat and meticulous , demonstrating a trend of de @-@ craf@@ t@@ manship .
in the current industrial civilization era , I think our contemporary handicraft should be de @-@ industrialized and de @-@ standardized , and should reflect the r@@ arity and preci@@ ousness of our contemporary handicraft .
finally , I would like to extend my most sincere respect to the artists who have been sticking to the traditional handicraft industry .
at the same time , I also hope that the viewers on the scene can continue to pay attention to the protection , inheritance and development of Chinese handicraft .
here , I would like to give you another special salute .
why do I talk about tolerance ?
because I &apos;m not a tolerant man .
why are we not tolerant ?
because we are often suppressed .
as you all know , criminal defense lawyers in China need to face prosecutors , the police , and the court all day , as well as judges who are also on their side .
as the western saying goes , &quot; When judges and prosecutors stand together , God can be the only defender . &quot;
less than a month ago , I handled a case involving a criminal organization in Guizhou .
there were 57 defendants , all standing in the assembly hall of a cinema , queuing in lines with more than 100 bail@@ i@@ ffs watching .
there were bail@@ i@@ ffs in the court and usually without orders from the presiding judge , bail@@ i@@ ffs are not allowed to move around .
yet a bail@@ iff approached me and took away my timer that was suspected to be a video recorder and examined it .
later , he came back again and took something else .
what was it ?
a high@@ lighter maker , claiming it was a wi@@ ret@@ ap device .
so I raised an objection to the presiding judge saying , &quot; He is violating my property rights , how could he just take away my stuff ? &quot;
but the presiding judge answered , &quot; It doesn &apos;t matter . we can talk about it later . &quot;
I replied , &quot; No , it does . maybe later he is going to take away my files , my computer and he might as well take me away . &quot;
finally , I told him , &quot; If you don &apos;t adjour@@ n , I will have to quit . because my physical safety and property rights are threatened . &quot;
so he adjour@@ ned .
for this trial , actually the defendants were not working for a criminal organization .
so when the defendants claimed that the police had tortured them for a confession , the police issued a written statement stating that they didn &apos;t torture them .
the defendants shouted , &quot; You &apos;re lying ! &quot;
one of them said , &quot; The judge tried to pursu@@ ade me to change my lawyer . &quot;
then the judge said , &quot; I didn &apos;t do that . &quot;
the defendant then claimed that the judge was also lying .
in the end , the older defendants said , &quot; You guys are mess@@ ing around . I am an old man now , so I can &apos;t really do anything after staying in prison for a few years , but they are young . they are gang@@ sters who are in their 20s . when they get out of prison , there is still a lot that they can do . &quot;
basically , he implied that the young defendants would seek revenge .
after knowing the situation , my last defense was , &quot; No matter how many years the sentence will be , don &apos;t seek revenge after getting out . when you lead a happy life , it will be the biggest revenge because justice will be served . but if you seek revenge , all my efforts now will be in vain because the law is not respected , and justice will not be served . &quot;
people are often suppressed , but still the value of tolerance should be promoted to some extent .
why ?
because our society is full of hatred , and tolerance is rarely seen .
let &apos;s take ordinary people for an example .
I saw on the news today that a man got a fake money from an ATM , but the bank didn &apos;t take accountability .
so the man bought some firecr@@ ackers and blew up the ATM .
see how intolerable people are .
a couple of days ago , I received a case .
it was on a snowy day , a man got drunk and naked so the traffic patrol officers cu@@ ffed him on their platform .
the man was sentenced to one year in prison with the crime of provocation .
that is just the beginning .
then a man passed by , just like I &apos;m walking now , and saw the naked man cu@@ ffed on the platform .
he thought it was funny .
so he borrowed a camera from his friend , took a picture with the comment , &quot; The job of traffic patrol officers is to protect people . why did they cuff a naked man there ? he &apos;s been cu@@ ffed for hours . the man is strong ! &quot;
he uploaded it to Q@@ Q .
the guy was sent to a La@@ og@@ ai camp for two years .
a buddy saw the man &apos;s post online and said , &quot; Is it real ? a naked man on a snowy day ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , it &apos;s true . &quot;
&quot; okay . I will forward the news . &quot;
he got two years in La@@ og@@ ai camp for forwarding the news .
how intol@@ er@@ ant it is !
just like in ancient China , if an author wrote something that was considered offensive , his property would be confiscated .
it &apos;s the same now , just to a different extent .
why would this happen ?
last month I was in Shanghai and I got a phone call .
the man said he was calling from a psychiatric hospital .
&quot; are you a doctor ? &quot; I asked .
&quot; no . I &apos;m a patient . &quot; he answered .
&quot; how did you get my number ? &quot; I asked .
&quot; I got it from someone else . &quot; he replied .
&quot; I &apos;m not mentally ill . I was sent here by the local police station . &quot;
&quot; I have a younger brother . I &apos;m not mentally ill . I was put here because I had a fight with the police . &quot;
I didn &apos;t believe him .
so I answered , &quot; Okay . give me your name and the name of the mental health facility . &quot;
so I asked my assistant to check it out and I posted on Wei@@ bo , &quot; seeking verification &quot; and I mentioned &quot; Shanghai publication . &quot;
later on , I found out that this man was kept there for eight years for the wrong reason !
since the local police station sent him there , the staff thought he had no parents nor siblings .
the neighborhood committee and Civil Affairs Bureau became his guardian .
at first , the Civil Affairs Bureau was reluctant to let us see his files , claiming that they were his guardians .
I told them , &quot; He has a younger brother . you can go check it out . if it &apos;s true , his brother is the guardian . &quot;
it turned out that he had a younger brother and a younger sister .
proving he was falsely detained !
this happened in a city like Shanghai , even though it &apos;s the most developed and civilized place in China .
the situation is the same between the government and the people .
why are we not tolerant ?
is it because of culture ?
do Chinese people carry a gene of intolerance ?
I don &apos;t think so .
there is always both tolerance and intolerance in every culture .
many of us think that western culture is quite tolerant and it respects people .
a classmate of mine went to the U.S. with me and praised the U.S. as a nation with manners .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t jump to conclusions so early . stay for a bit longer , then tell me what you think . &quot;
did you how many people were burnt to death in western countries because of religious persecution ?
let &apos;s talk about Cathol@@ icism .
okay .
how many people were burned to death in Geneva Gal@@ vin , the prote@@ st@@ ant ?
not to mention anti @-@ S@@ emi@@ tic people , wit@@ ches being burnt to death , and the crus@@ ades marching through the east .
can you call them tolerant ?
was there tolerance in their culture ?
not exactly .
western tolerance started since their religious revolution because Prote@@ stants began to say , &quot; I don &apos;t need Catholic formalities because God speaks for people , so each man can stand in front of God with a Bible . &quot;
from then on , western culture started to become more tolerant because people &apos;s religious beliefs became diversified .
the Prote@@ stants in the U.K. had a tough time , so they went to a new continent and founded a new country called , the United States .
now you can see that in various cultures , there are different cultural components .
in the U.K. , among other island countries , I believe that there are many integrated factors that have combined to create a democratic and a constitutional system .
it has defined the scope of the country and society , as well as the separation of church and state , which may have a great impact on tolerance .
some of the things we advocate for now have been promoted by the United Nations .
the core principle is to respect people &apos;s spiritual pursuits and that there &apos;s a limit to that .
in other words , the differences in spiritual pursuits should be communicated and treated in a peaceful manner .
so let &apos;s go back to the topic .
why should I talk about tolerance ?
because nowadays , China has entered a plur@@ alistic era .
there are conflicts between cultures , between people and between interests .
when I talk about these backgrounds , I believe that we need to get rid of the conflicts , and alleviate the intolerance between the government and society .
how can we do it ?
first of all , the strong should be tolerant .
if you are one of the majority , you need to be tolerant because this is the only way minorities will feel a sense of security .
if the strong are intol@@ er@@ ant , they will eventually go to the extremes in the end .
secondly , in an environment where the strong are tolerant , the government should pass laws to protect the interests of the weak because their identities are inter@@ changeable .
that is to say , I &apos;m an individual and so are you .
which is I prefer the Buddhist man@@ tra that , &quot; Everyone is the same . &quot;
there are still much intolerance deeply rooted in western culture , including colon@@ ization and racial segregation .
it wasn &apos;t that long ago these problems were solved .
black people didn &apos;t have the right to vote before the civil rights movement in the 1960s .
George Bush Jr . &quot; s decision to attack Iraq is a prime example that the strong are intol@@ er@@ ant .
he said , &quot; Iraq has weapons of mass destruction . &quot;
did Iraq have them ?
no .
did Iraq have nuclear bombs ?
no .
so the strong should make concessions .
if they don &apos;t , they are going to pay a high price for it .
the U.S. paid a lot for the war in Iraq .
many soldiers sacrificed their lives , not to mention all of the money that was spent .
we &apos;re running out of time , so let &apos;s us look back at Lu Xun .
why could Lu Xun be tolerant ?
because of the time he was in and the same reason applies for Hu Shi .
we all know Hu Shi was a liberal , and he always called for tolerance .
he believed that tolerance is more important than freedom .
the core of liber@@ alism is democracy , freedom , tolerance over opposition and gradual reform .
those were the main ide@@ ologies Hu Shi promoted .
in the end , I want to tell you this .
please be kind to others because that is the only way others will be kind to you in return .
drinking together is so much better than fighting .
thank you very much !
CCTV news has played a documentary for 9 days in a row during the Mid @-@ autumn @-@ National holiday .
Xin@@ wen Li@@ an@@ Bo , CCTV &apos;s national news program , famous for its serious broadcasting style , also played 8 episodes of this documentary , which has somehow prompted us , those on holiday , to ponder what happiness is exactly .
Aristotle once said the Happiness was the whole aim@@ e and the end of human existence .
another saying goes , &quot; Happiness for three lives . &quot;
the three lives here refer to , in a chron@@ ological sense , three generations , or previous life , this life and after@@ life as in Buddhism .
besides , our three lives &apos; happiness could be interpreted from a dimensional perspective , It is a dimensional space with length , width and height , namely x @-@ axis , y @-@ axis and z @-@ axis .
so here we have the materi@@ alistic , the institutional and spiritual life .
happiness isn &apos;t positively related to wealth .
except for certain materi@@ alistic security , we also need sound interpersonal relationship and inner peace of mind .
so to gain happiness , we need to handle well not only the relationship between people and things , but also that between people , as well as that with ourselves .
well , we might as well check out several cases in the documentary .
a 85 @-@ year @-@ old man in Chengdu named Li , whose wife passed away 15 years ago , is now a nude model for fine art students .
every time after the drawing is finished , he would discuss his sket@@ ches with those students .
he said , &quot; All of this makes me happy ! &quot;
another elder woman was asked by CCTV journalist when she was picking vegetables on a sunny day .
&quot; do you feel happy ? &quot;
she answered , &quot; Yes , I do . even though I &apos;m only paid 1000 RMB every month , I financed my daughter to acquire the postgraduate degree . &quot;
also I believe you all know , this year &apos;s Nobel Prize winner for Literature , Mo Yan , when asked by the CCTV journalist what happiness meant for him , he responded , &quot; Happiness is to think nothing , put everything down . stay in good health and have no mental stress . &quot;
so now you understand that the relationships of materi@@ alistic , spiritual , interpersonal and inner @-@ self are inseparable .
let us look at those unhappy cases .
for instance this one about primitive ecosystem , which marks a major style shift of CCTV to touch upon down @-@ to @-@ earth matters .
here around 10 % is about unhappiness .
one vendor in Chengdu was asked , &quot; Are you happy ? &quot;
how did he answer ?
&quot; how could I be happy ? when mouse is chased by cats , do you think the mouse is happy ? I wish I could live a life without the Cheng@@ guan ! &quot;
Wang Zhu , a poet from the Song Dynasty , once wrote a piece named Happy .
in Chinese , the character &quot; Xi &quot; means &quot; Happy or happiness . &quot;
so what is happiness , exactly ?
as we all know : firstly , happiness is when rain drops after a long drought ; this is materi@@ alistic happiness ; secondly , happiness is when you meet old friends in a place away from home , that is happiness in an interpersonal sense ; thirdly , happiness is to spend the wedding night with your beloved one , happiness in a physiological sense ; and last but not least , to succeed in exams is also happiness , for this is his / her pursuit and fulfillment of career .
so now you find that Chinese scholars of ancient times had a very thorough understanding of happiness .
they saw it in a dimensional way .
that &apos;s also what we &apos;ve been talking about , the meaning of happiness .
United Nations responded to this question with the Happiness Index , released for the very first time in 2012 .
when the index came out , which country topped the chart ?
Denmark .
U.S ranked 11th while Chinese Hongkong was the 6@@ 7th and Chinese Mainland , 1@@ 12th .
the Happiness Index is higher when the life is relatively rich and not the richest in wealth .
because if the richness of life manif@@ asts most in wealth , something else might be missing .
this is the same with Harvard en@@ rolling students with relatively high scores instead of the highest scores , for the former tend to be more creative , have more of their own stories , dreams and vitality .
then why happiness is a relative concept ?
we &apos;ll answer this question from three levels .
at the first level , in a mathematical sense , what is happiness ?
happiness is an inner feeling that you &apos;re living with the materi@@ alistic , spiritual and institutional elements .
Confucius once said , &quot; At fifteen I set my heart upon learning . at thirty , I had planted my feet firm upon the ground . at forty , I no longer suffered from complexities . at fifty , I knew what were the bid@@ dings of Heaven . at sixty , I heard them with doc@@ ile ear . at seventy , I could follow the dict@@ ates of my own heart ; for what I desired no longer over@@ stepped the boundaries of right . &quot;
this is how Confucius concluded his life and how he introduced himself when he paid visits to the other countries .
this passage is telling us that the older you get , your subjective understanding and cognition will be ever more objective .
his goal is quite realistic and can be achieved through hard efforts .
therefore Confucius has been a person with a high happiness index .
so in this sense , it is important to set the right goal in the first place .
for materi@@ alistic life , we might as well just take the right amount , namely the relative richness , as the happiness index indicates .
do not consume what we don &apos;t need , regarding clothes , food , housing and travel .
the function of 15 shirts or 15,000 shirts is the same , there is no need to have more .
so that &apos;s why it is relative in a mathematical sense .
at the second level , why is the theory of happiness a relative one ?
if we look at belief , including political and religious belief .
for people having different beliefs , they feel happiness differently .
as Wen Jiabao , former Chinese premier , once put it , &quot; We must strive to help our people live a happier and more decent life . &quot;
therefore , people with different beliefs have a very different sense of happiness in different periods of times !
when I was a visiting professor in the United States , on one Christmas , I went to church with Professor Pear@@ son , the dean of the School of Social Sciences at the University of Southern Illinois to see other people wor@@ shi@@ ping .
he believed in the Theory of Ev@@ olution and Big B@@ ang Cos@@ m@@ ology instead of the theory that men were created by God .
however , he felt it was no harm for him to discuss religion with me .
he said : &quot; people with religious belief want to do good things so that they can go to heaven after death . just because in his mind there is such thing as heaven , he is not afraid of death . even if he dies , he feels that he can meet with his deceased relatives . so while he lives , he improves the quality of his life . &quot;
his words , in my opinion , deliver some in @-@ depth thinking that different beliefs can also bring us different shades of happiness .
at the third level , why is happiness relative ?
from the philosophical point of view , everything develops through a process .
Abraham Mas@@ low , an American psychologist and management scientist , proposed the theory of hierarchy of needs .
he said that there are five human needs that moves gradually .
there are physiological needs for clothes , food , shelter , transport or sex .
at the second level , what comes after is the safety needs .
it &apos;s not just security of employment but to make people feel secured so that they don &apos;t worry about job security , illness or their pension .
and then it comes to the spiritual need , including need of love , social needs and need of esteem and need of self fulfillment .
therefore , human &apos;s needs constantly move upward !
a professor of history at Yale University in the United States called Place , proposed S @-@ curve theory and process theory .
he said that development of any process is as if a capital S that can be divided into four stages .
it starts out slowly and then speeds up , slows down , reaches the equilibrium and goes downward like the letter S .
he compared it to a person &apos;s life .
after you were born , you grow slowly and then at puberty , you grow much faster .
then you slow down a bit between 20 to 25 . then at the age of 25 , you reach a peak , especially the boys .
and then comes the equilibrium .
if you were at my age , you are on the downward path .
after you reach the ceiling , you would go down .
the process theory is widely applied and to put it simply , water bri@@ ms only to overflow .
Su Dong@@ po , a poet from the Song Dynasty , once said , &quot; Our life is always filled with both happiness and sorrow , ju@@ ts like the moon that always wa@@ xes and wan@@ es . &quot;
all good things come to an end .
we need to understand that happiness , the pursuit of happiness is a process .
the happiest moment is not the night of Sunday but that of Friday because you &apos;ve got something to look forward to .
so to be happy , we are actually trying to maximize the happiness we can get in the pursuit of it .
Chinese people used to greet people with a question that I called &quot; the official greeting &quot; whereas others may call it &quot; an official curse word . &quot;
then what is it ?
have you eaten yet ?
but this question only concerns the materi@@ alistic life .
so I &apos;d like to propose that from now on let &apos;s do a bit of upgrade into the 2.0 or 3.@@ 0 version , to think in a dimensional way .
so next time we would say , &quot; Are you happy ? &quot;
let &apos;s see the world with generosity , live the life at ease and cheer each other to make it happen !
thank you !
today I will tell the story of the charity program &quot; Tour of S@@ ight . &quot;
I am an ocul@@ ist that has dealt with eye diseases for 28 years .
I think I am a good doctor who wor@@ ths the trust of patients .
I came to Shanghai 13 years ago and I have been working as an ocul@@ ist ever since .
the people of Shanghai trust me , during the election of Top@@ 10 Doc@@ tors in Shanghai that was just held not long ago , I received a majority of votes and was selected as one of the ten most popular doctors .
as an ocul@@ ist , I am always thinking about what I can do for the blind .
therefore , in 2006 , we initiated and organized a purely private charity activity : go to the most remote and poorest places in China to bring light to the blind .
we went to seven places in seven years , treated 5,@@ 5@@ 48 people and operated on 7@@ 20 patients .
every operation was a success with zero infection .
the patients were very satisfied .
as we all know , eyes are the windows of the heart .
eyes are very important to everyone .
they are not only the compass for our work , study and life , but also an important organ that brings us happiness .
today since we &apos;ve come together , let &apos;s feel the darkness .
please turn off the lights .
for a normal person , when he opens his eyes , he can see a colorful world .
when he closes his eyes , he can feel a moment of peace brought by darkness , which is a kind of joy to him .
for a blind person , however , he cannot see anything light in his life .
so the torture brought by darkness to the blind is beyond the imagination of ordinary people .
this shows our tour to Yu@@ ex@@ i , a country located within Li@@ ang@@ shan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan province in 2011 .
we diagnosed 1,4@@ 96 people and performed more than 190 operations .
one story was very impressive to me .
why ?
a father and his little son heard that our charity program had come to this county , so he came to see it .
in the process of consulting , his father said that in his family there were still two children who could not see .
when asked why he didn &apos;t bring them along , he said that the whole family had only fifty yuan altogether .
he couldn &apos;t afford to come by taking a taxi with the other two children .
because the Yi people live in remote mountains , practically one home resting on one hill .
at this time , our team members took out several hundreds yuan and asked him to bring his children there as soon as possible .
when the three children came to our ophthal@@ m@@ ologist , they were found all blind due to congenital cataract .
how do we feel about such a scene as ophthal@@ m@@ ologists and volunteers ?
sometimes a little money can change the fate of a person or a family .
in Shanghai , when you stand on the Bun@@ d and watch the shining lights on both sides of Huang@@ pu River , you may think of the strength and prosperity of our country .
however , China has a vast territory and the difference between the east and the west or the gap between the rich and the poor is very large .
if you go to have a look at the remote and poverty @-@ stricken areas , you will feel deeply that the life of the people at the bottom level in our country is very difficult .
according to official statistics , there are still 2 million cataract patients in China who need surgery , of which half are located in the poor areas of western China .
because these areas are relatively poor and isolated with no adequate information or medical treatment , these patients cannot be treated .
these are some photos we took in G@@ olo@@ g , Qinghai .
therefore , under such circumstances , our ophthal@@ m@@ ologists have the responsibility to integrate some social resources to help blind people in poor areas see the light again and enjoy the prosperity of our society .
so we initiated the charity program &quot; Tour of S@@ ight . &quot;
for the seven years after this charity tour was launched , it has not been affiliated to any organization .
it has not adopted any bonding system and has not received any donations from any foundations , the Red Cross or any governmental organisations .
neither has it been sponsored under any title .
why ?
we want to explore a Chinese civil charity campaign .
that is , anyone can give out what he or she has , be it money , skills , technology , or ideas . once a year , we go to one most remote places in China to do this charity tour aiming to cure cataract .
our principle is to use the best doctors , the best equipment and the best materials .
some people suggest that it may cost two or three thousand yuan to purchase an intra@@ ocular lens of the best quality .
but if we buy the cheaper ones , we could have maybe ten and we could operate on ten patients then .
but our philosophy is that for people in remote and poverty @-@ stricken areas , it is very rare for them to get an operation .
I cannot possibly cause some unnecessary complications to them because our materials are not good enough and our doctors are not up to standard .
if so , the charitable campaign we do may cause exactly opposite effects .
therefore , we must really do something and do it best .
that &apos;s why I am in the position to say that for seven years , I have seen more than 5,000 patients and performed 700 operations .
none of them have been infected , none have complained , and no complications have occurred , just because we are using the best things .
because it is very easy for people to donate some money .
the volunteers with the tours are either bosses of enterprises or el@@ ites of the society .
they are people from all walks of life , such as government officials and directors of private entre@@ prises .
it is a simple thing for them to donate money , but the key is to contribute the efforts .
therefore , in our charity tour , we require the don@@ ators to personally go there and experience the whole process .
if you donate the money but fail to go for some reason , the money will be returned to you .
and I can &apos;t let you donate too much , you just need to offer a little money , do a little work and share we@@ al and woe together with the program .
directors of enterprises will witness how@@ our charity help people , if he don@@ ates ten patients , then these ten patients are able to see again thanks to his donation .
don@@ ators will rest assured and feel very happy , because every cent of the donation is open and transparent .
and the doctors we choose are the best .
they are all top professors in ophthal@@ m@@ ology in Shanghai .
they are not only famous , but more importantly they are sophisticated with their work , they cut well , which we are totally aware of .
therefore , ophthal@@ m@@ ological directors of 18 hospitals in Shanghai have joined us , including Professor Yuan Fei of Zhong@@ shan Hospital , Professor Zhao P@@ ei@@ quan , the iron @-@ man of Xinhua Hospital , Professor Z@@ ou Ha@@ id@@ ong of Shanghai First People &apos;s Hospital , Professor Xu Jian@@ jiang of the Hospital of O@@ ph@@ thal@@ m@@ ology and O@@ tor@@ hin@@ ol@@ ar@@ yn@@ g@@ ology , Professor Chen Gu@@ o@@ hui of the Sixth Hospital , and other professors from Shu@@ guang Hospital , from Lon@@ ghua Hospital , etc .
the el@@ ites of 18 hospitals .
even you are in Shanghai and you want to go to see these doctors , you have to queue up for a long time to get an expert number .
however , they are able to put down their work , put down their senior parents and their children , just to follow there .
why ?
they said that they have moved themselves in this charity tour .
doctors may often touch others , but it is rare doctors to be touched by patients .
so when we were back in Xinjiang , many doctors were so touched by their own deeds as to shed tears at our review meeting because we really helped others .
this is our trip to G@@ olo@@ g , Qinghai Province in August this year .
G@@ olo@@ g in Qinghai is the highest autonomous prefecture in China , with an average altitude of 4@@ 200 meters .
it is also the prefecture with the most backward economy and the harsh@@ est natural environment .
why did we choose there ?
because our intention was to choose a most remote and poor area that lacks medic@@ ical treatments , G@@ olo@@ g in Qinghai is the place we were looking for .
this place is six times bigger th@@ ant Shanghai in territory , but it has only 150,000 people .
at that time when contacting the local government , I said we wanted to do something charitable in this place and cure catar@@ acts .
the government staff said that their area was scarcely populated and they may not have enough patients for us .
I said that we should see at least 100 people and 1000 patients at most .
to make a difference the number needs to be that big .
but through our efforts , 400 people arrived on the first day .
we saw a total of 1,4@@ 96 patients and performed 161 operations on that tour .
what does this tell us ?
in China &apos;s remote and poor areas , there are more people suffering eye diseases or other diseases than the government imagined .
I remember a volunteer who went for four tours , and cried twice .
his task was to transport the patients from the outpatient department to the ward .
it was raining on that day .
he was holding an umbrella on one hand and the patient on the other .
his could not speak the dialect there and totally got wet on his side .
however , he was kind enough to send the patient to the ward , making dozens of trips back and forth , each time going to a poor area .
the first stop we visited was in the countryside , a small hospital in a township .
every time there would be out of bed , but there were many patients waiting .
we would made room in their meeting rooms and corridors , then we bought some mat@@ t@@ resses for patients .
although the environment was very difficult , our treatment quality was nothing but low .
not only do we want the best effect , but also the guaranteed safety .
deep in the mountain , a young man wanted to go out for work .
but his mother could not see so he had to take care of his mother .
so he had one only wish that his mother could recover sight so he could walk out of the mountain .
our charity program &quot; Tour of S@@ ight &quot; has fulfilled his wish and he had come out of the mountain .
for a blind person , how happy he or she would be to have the chance to regain eyesight .
we have always stressed in doing this charity tour that we should satisfy the patients , the society and ourselves .
because surgery is a matter of conscience .
even though your colleagues recognize your skills , &quot; Nice cut , &quot; only on hearing this could one claims the operation successful .
at the same time , we have also donated a batch of equipment to the local areas and we have trained some doctors .
we have already trained three doctors .
wherever we went , we donated a batch of basic ophthal@@ mic equipment .
we invited local doctors to Shanghai to train them free of charge , and then they were sent back , so the people there would know that there are still doctors who can see eye diseases .
there is a story I remember very clearly .
there was a beautiful 16 @-@ year @-@ old Kazak@@ h girl in Xinjiang .
I think she is very beautiful , because her face is fair and she is very tall .
but she did not go to school for even one day .
how can you explain why has a person never been to school at the age of 16 ?
because she has inverted eye hair .
inverted eye hair can stimulate eyes to tears , with corneal ulcer , and the patient could not open her eyes outdoors .
this is one of the simplest common illnesses in Shanghai .
even our resident doctors can do it swiftly .
there we operated on her and the next day she could see .
one month after we returned to Shanghai , the magistrate of Qin@@ ghe county , Mr.@@ Zhou , called me one night , telling me that the girl had started to go to school .
when we heard the news , we thought all our efforts were worth it . because she hadn &apos;t been to school for ten years . and our one little favor changed her fate .
a sign of social progress is the sense of happiness and security of the entire people , so attention must be paid to the vulnerable groups .
as an ophthal@@ m@@ ologist , I need to care about the blind so they can live happily .
only in this way can the society develop further .
we have been to the snow @-@ covered plat@@ e@@ aux , to the foot of the Tian@@ shan Mountains , to the loess plateau in Gansu , to the Hor@@ q@@ in grassland in Inner Mongolia , to Li@@ ang@@ shan Mountain in Sichuan , to our country &apos;s border in Yunnan , to G@@ olo@@ g in Qinghai .
in seven years , we &apos;ve been to seven places .
&quot; tour of S@@ ight &quot; may have just solved a small part of problems related to the shortage of medical care and medicines in the locality , which is just a small fraction of problems and is far from enough .
but the tour has brought hope and dream to the local people .
they will know that some people are still caring for them , and their blindness can still be cured .
as I said in my medical practice , as long as a meteor stre@@ aks in the darkness , we will have lights and hopes .
therefore , the tour has not only treated their eyes , but also awakened more people in a deeper sense .
lend your hand , pay attention to vulnerable groups and give your love .
by the way , let &apos;s look at this clip .
&quot; tour to S@@ ight &quot; will continue to travel across the mountains and rivers of western China to bring light to those in darkness there .
I also hope you will support it !
thank you .
on one autumn day in 2006 , I quit my job at CCTV because I had a dream .
I wanted to find an answer .
who paid the most and has contributed the most to the process of urbanization in China ?
I came to Guangzhou and went to a lot of factories because I wanted to make a documentary about migrant workers .
after almost 20 days of looking for the subject of this documentary , I met the right couple : a man named Zhang Chan@@ ghua and a woman named Chen Su@@ q@@ in .
I referred to them as brother Zhang and sister Chen .
when I met them for the first time , Chen told me about their story .
she told me that 16 years ago she left her 8 @-@ month @-@ old daughter to work in Guangzhou , around 1994 or 1995 .
on that day , she and her husband together packed all of their belongings , and all of her sisters came to see her off .
sister Chen said , &quot; I was holding my daughter Zhang Qin . she was only 8 months old then . &quot;
she continued , &quot; I cried and walked , and soon I came to the village entrance . my sisters tried to persuade me to stay until the child grew a bit older .
she said , &quot; But I knew in my heart that I had no choice . if I didn &apos;t go out to work to earn money , how would I be able to raise my daughter ? when she grows up , would she walk the same way as I did and stay in the countryside all her life ? I tried my best to hold back my tears , handed my daughter to my sister , and then followed my husband and walked out of the village without looking back . &quot;
she said , &quot; I heard my daughter crying , I was crying too . but there was no turning back . &quot;
this story touched me deeply .
I decided to follow this couple for my documentary , &quot; Hom@@ ec@@ oming Tr@@ ain . &quot;
in the following three years , we followed the family and fil@@ med more than 350 hours of material about their lives , work , and the round @-@ trips between the city and the countryside .
this story is actually not just about the couple .
I think what is more important is their 8 @-@ month @-@ old daughter , Zhang Qin .
I decided to follow both the daughter and the couple and to pick up clues in the countryside and the city at the same time .
time flew , and after a year I returned to the countryside with the parents .
the only thing they told their child was to study hard , go to college in the city and work there .
they told her not to walk their old path , sitting in front of sewing machines in a factory for a dozen years .
but the 16 @-@ year @-@ old child couldn &apos;t bring herself to listen to her parents &apos; words .
as a result , in the second year of filming , Zhang Qin dropped out of school with her classmate and went to X@@ intang , a small city next to Guangzhou . she went to a jeans factory there and became a young worker .
what Zhang Qin had done made her parents lose sleep .
all their dedication seemed to turn to dust and ashes in that moment .
when the Chinese New Year of 2008 was about to come , brother Zhang and sister Chen couldn &apos;t help it anymore and went to Zhang Qin &apos;s factory to take her home .
they were quite bothered but managed to get return train tickets despite the holiday .
the whole family came to Guangzhou Station and waited to return to their hometown of Gu@@ ang &apos;an .
you probably still remember the snow@@ storm that the whole country suffered during the Chinese New Year of 2008 .
all the trains were canceled .
six million people were held up at Guangzhou Station for seven days .
the Zhang family and our crew were there too .
so in our film , &quot; Hom@@ ec@@ oming Tr@@ ain , &quot; there is a part about this .
let &apos;s take a look .
although I have seen it thousands of times , it makes me sad every single time .
at the beginning of the video , there is a little girl in pink .
as you can see , she wi@@ pes tears from her eyes and rushes out of the crowd with a bag several times larger than her .
she was out of breath and couldn &apos;t stand it any longer .
it was likely that she had been there for 3 days and nights .
she put her bag on the pedestrian steps .
a policeman helped her to put the big sack back on her shoulder .
she wiped her tears again and then disappeared into the crowd .
I was there right next to the camera .
I saw her and I thought I would never see her again .
it felt like a knife stab@@ bing my heart .
I understand why she couldn &apos;t stay put for a second .
it was because if she didn &apos;t catch her train , she wouldn &apos;t be able to see her relatives for a total of two years .
I was thinking , was this the price that must be paid for China &apos;s urbanization ?
who was paying for it then ?
should we remember these people , who paid such a price ?
they would also like to enjoy the fruits of the country &apos;s economic development , and they hoped to be a part of it .
in fact , during the three years of filming , we spent at least six months a year in the factory to get all kinds of scenes like this .
shots like this often appear : children sit along a road with big bund@@ les of jeans to be exported to all over the world ; young people still have their dreams .
although they had to work a dozen hours a day , some of the motivated ones would read books afterwards , hoping to jump out of the factory one day .
you can see this everywhere .
is this the price for urbanization ?
migration from rural to urban areas does not happen only in China , nor does it only occur today .
100 years ago , on the European continent , farmers began to leave the countryside and were transformed from peasants into the urban working class .
they tended to settle down in the center of cities and then slowly build up their own networks of acquaintances .
at the same time , those who originally lived in the cities were very hostile to them .
it is said that a few days ago , some Beijing parents went to protest at the doors of the Ministry of Education against the decision that the children of outsiders could also take part in the college entrance exam in Beijing .
they think that outsider students rob from the shared resources for education , which they feel is not right .
so this is very ironic , I think .
this is because you need to think about who built these high @-@ rise buildings , who is working on the construction sites , who is serving us in the restaurants , who is paving the roads for us ?
everything is built by these migrant workers .
our economy cannot make it without them , no matter whether it is the export @-@ oriented economy or infrastructure investments .
in the story we fil@@ med , Zhang Qin is a representative example of the migrant workers born in the 1980s and 1990s .
in fact , she is an example of failure , because she didn &apos;t finish her education , and so she could only become a worker .
two years after we fil@@ med the documentary , she wandered through several cities across China .
she went to Hubei , went to Beijing for school , and then went to work in Guangdong .
everything is only temporary for her , as there are no fixed jobs to take her in , so she will always be ro@@ ot@@ less .
nowadays , there is a large part of history that happens to be experienced and created by ro@@ ot@@ less people like her .
last year I gave sister Chen , the mother , a call .
she is taking care of her son in her hometown , because she feels that , since she has been away from home for so many years , her son hates her a lot .
her daughter said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a father or a mother . they have never loved me . &quot;
Chen said , &quot; I really want to apologize to my daughter , but I cannot find her . &quot;
Zhang Qin is not willing to speak a word to them anymore , and I have become the solitary midd@@ lem@@ an between them , sometimes even exchanging messages for them .
a family of two generations just broke down like this .
is that the price of urbanization ?
what I want to say is , in order to prevent this tragedy from happening again to China &apos;s 240 million migrant workers , I hope we can stop to think about what can be done .
can we give the children of migrant workers equal educational rights ?
can we give factory workers equal social benefits ?
can they have equal wages ?
for the people who work hard on construction sites day and night , will there be a day in which they can sit with us at &quot; T@@ n@@ Dao &quot; to learn and to integrate into this society ?
these are the questions that we need to ask everyone .
thank you .
it &apos;s said today is the end of the world , and you must be very disappointed as the world is still spinning .
but somebody said to me , &quot; wait , we don &apos;t know if the sun would rise tomorrow . &quot;
in fact , the ap@@ ocaly@@ pse doesn &apos;t frighten me at all , but I &apos;m a little worried .
for me , it &apos;s ok if we perish together .
but I worry that when I die , you are still living in this world .
this is so unfair .
how do we start to ask questions ?
when I was little , I started asking the most basic questions .
the first of them was where I came from .
my mom gave me an answer .
she said , &quot; You are f@@ ished out from a river . &quot;
many years later , because of the nature of my job , I met many big@@ w@@ igs .
and I asked them where they came from .
many of them were told that they were found in trash cans .
knowing that today &apos;s host , Jiang Chang@@ jian , is also from trash cans , I feel so much better .
we usually ask questions out of curiosity .
but questions after questions , once our curiosity is appe@@ ased , may result from misunderstanding .
the world has seen so many mis@@ under@@ stan@@ ings .
by becoming a man who makes a living by asking questions , I may add another misunderstanding to this world .
I never see myself as a wise tal@@ ker .
since childhood , if somebody asked me to do something as simple as talking to others , I could get cold feet .
I once looked up to a man who had an exceptionally big mouth .
it could have been very romantic if that big mouth was used to eat or kiss .
sadly , this man used his mouth to talk , for which he was killed at last .
he is Socrates .
Socrates &apos;s story often has me thinking how hard it is to talk .
just as mouth is not only for eating , we talk not only to inform people , but also to clear misunderstandings .
however , it really racks our brains to come up with a good question .
I have been asking questions for a living for a long time .
and I feel lucky because my job is as simple as posing questions , and well @-@ paid .
according to my calculation , I have asked over 30 thousand questions in more than 10 years as a TV talk show host .
if I compile those questions into a book , it must be a very thick one , equivalent of the book I have read in my childhood - I Won@@ der Why .
sometimes I think to myself , my god , how stupid my book would sound .
I have asked many terrible questions , and I have also got headache and insomnia for drying up my inspiration to ask questions .
as you know , my peer Cu@@ i Yong@@ yuan , a Chinese TV talk show host , has insomnia too .
but I guess being more handsome helps me earn more sympathy than him .
in retrospect , how did I come up with those questions ?
what is a good question ?
and what is a terrible one ?
as a matter of fact , it is still beyond my ability to answer these two questions .
I don &apos;t have a clue about what is a good question .
although ignorant of how to tell a good question , I &apos;m so clear in mind about what a terrible question is like .
most terrible questions are superficial .
for example , Sophie Mar@@ ce@@ au has been asked which role she likes most for more than 1 thousand times .
someone once asked Li Ze@@ hou what he did for a living .
there is another terrible question asked by a young journalist who was my co @-@ worker when interviewing the nationwide idol Ge You .
what should he prepare to nail it ? more importantly , he also ad@@ ores Ge You .
he took that interview very seriously .
he wrote down the questions in a paper and practiced them over and over again in front of the mirror .
I had checked that paper , and there were about 500 words .
as the interview just begun , he started reading the paper to Ge You in case he should forget any details .
in his mind , this would never be a terrible question .
but when he finished reading , Ge You answered in this manner , &quot; Well , I think you have asked a very funny question . &quot;
if I were that journalist , I would have swe@@ ated right away on hearing such a reply .
even now I often ask some terrible questions like he did .
after all , a good question is really hard won .
I have to practice many times .
it is strange that whenever I tell others that I am not smart , they seem not to believe it .
as a result , I have to practice over and over again behind the scene .
where did I start the practice ?
in 1999 , when I was making a documentary program in Beijing , I shot a video named Brothers during an interview .
the video is based on a true story that happened in Shang@@ dong .
there are two brothers sticking together and helping each other in difficulties since they lost their parents .
in order to raise the younger brother , the elder brother dropped out of school to make money .
later , he even paid the younger brother &apos;s college tuition by selling his blood .
the younger brother studied computer in college , and he planned to join a computer skill training .
what will he do to pay the training fee ?
at that time , the elder brother was to@@ iling at a constructions site during the daytime , and in a computer company at night as a security guard .
at the end of his resources , he made a stu@@ ip@@ id and possibly the only choice .
he coll@@ uded with a criminal gang to steal 4 computers from the company he worked for .
a computer was worth over CN@@ Y 10,000 in 1999 , as a result , he may be sentenced to 10 years in prison accum@@ ul@@ atively .
after sending his younger brother some money , he abs@@ con@@ ded .
then , the law en@@ forc@@ ers came to the younger brother for cooperation . being asked to place righteousness above family loyalty , the younger brother promised to help capture his elder brother .
when his elder brother contacted him again , he lied that he was seriously ill .
hearing this bad news , the elder brother came to his college at all hazards , but got caught finally .
I was very young at that time .
I , along with the camer@@ amen , directors and other staff , conducted this special interview .
after much ado , we were permitted to interview the younger brother and the elder brother in the prison .
the two brothers didn &apos;t look like the same at all .
one common feature that I remembered clearly was that they both had thick lips .
whenever I mentioned the one to the other , both the elder and younger brothers demonstrated a same expression and dropped on tongue , with lips shaking .
words failed me when I saw the expression on the elder brother &apos;s face .
many years later , I became a journalist in the Department of Special Contribu@@ tion in a newspaper office .
actually , I was only in my tw@@ enties then .
one day , an elder came to our office , on whose face the expression reminded me of the brothers instantly .
through the traces on their faces left by life , one can tell what they have been through .
therefore , I have to sigh that how complicated the human nature is .
when the elder came in , I had no idea what he planned to do .
he carried with a woven bag that you all are familiar with , put it down , and then took something out word@@ lessly .
what is it ?
files for his appeal .
he put all the materials on my desk , piling them up to a height like this , still without a word spoken .
finally , I asked him a question while looking at him , &quot; what are you going to do ? &quot;
suddenly , he kne@@ eled down .
as our floor is ti@@ led , I could clearly hear the crisp &quot; cl@@ ang &quot; sound when his kne@@ eled down on the tiles .
I could hardly understand why a nearly 70 @-@ year @-@ old elder would kne@@ el down in front of a 24 @-@ year @-@ old man .
it was due to my identity - a journalist .
in their eyes , a journalist is the modern equivalent of Bao Qing@@ tian , an upright government officer in the Song Dynasty .
since then I began to realize that the society was full of un@@ fairness .
next , I will talk about the year of 2003 .
that year was very unusual .
I directed a large live program named Competition on Mount Hua by Jin Yong , the pen at the television station .
although Jin Yong invented the term of Competition on Mount Hua , he had never been to Mount Hua in person .
taking the chance of that program , we had the honour to invite Jin Yong to Mount Hua for the first time .
he even reached the top of Mount Hua .
before the program , we mobilized 5 newspaper offices to screen out some Jin Yong &apos;s fans , who then were given the chance to talk to Jin Yong face to face at Mount Hua .
there was a 5 @-@ year @-@ old child who looked very smart and cute , resembling the Tin@@ tin in The Ad@@ ventures of Tin@@ tin .
after becoming close friends , I asked him &quot; what will you ask Jin Yong when you see him ? &quot;
the child replied : &quot; I wonder how many people he can take on at one time . &quot;
that was an excellent question .
it made me think why I couldn &apos;t come up with that question .
what happened between human nature and society ?
then I thought the society had taken away my innocence , making me complicated .
this kid really asked this question to Jin Yong , then he answered &quot; I can &apos;t fight anyone . &quot;
the child continued &quot; if so , why do you say you are a knight @-@ err@@ ant ? &quot;
he said &quot; I just write in my book that a knight @-@ err@@ ant who is great shall fight for his country and people . &quot;
that question was beyond the child &apos;s apprehension , and not to his taste .
well , since I am an adult , I must ask something profound .
but , what am I going to ask ?
in addition to martial arts and chi@@ val@@ ry , there are also many love stories in Jing Yong &apos;s novels .
so I asked him &quot; what kind of love is perfect in your eyes since you have written countless love stories in your novels ? &quot;
according to my memory , he once said that he was moved to tears whilst writing some specific love stories .
then I wondered what they were .
Jin Yong cried when writing the farewell scene between Zhang Wu@@ ji and Xiao Zhao .
Jin Yong cried when writing the scene that Xiao Feng killed A Zhu by mistake .
Jin Yong cried when writing the scene that Xia@@ ol@@ ong@@ n@@ v didn &apos;t show up as agreed with Yang Guo 16 years ago , leaving Yang Guo to wait alongside the Du@@ anch@@ ang Cli@@ ff till sunset . that day sti@@ fles all hopes Yang Guo has to his world .
I asked him &quot; Do you still feel sad when reading those scenes again ? &quot;
he answered &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; what does the most ideal love look like in your eyes ? &quot; , I continued .
he gave me a short answer , &quot; fall in love at first sight , live to old age in conju@@ gal bliss and be loyal to each other until death . &quot;
then , up to no good , I asked him &quot; Are you one of those who have followed that standard ? &quot;
how will he reply ?
let your imagination run free .
in front of the close @-@ up shot , he said , &quot; No , I &apos;m a man with a low moral standard . &quot;
actually , he said so when we were broadcasting live .
normally , every TV television will keep a record of audience rating .
that conversation set the highest audience rating among the over 4 @-@ hour long program .
that interview helped me understand one truth , which doesn &apos;t indicate the complicated human nature or unfair society .
what is it ?
the truth is that obstacles will always remain there , regardless of whether you escape or not .
for years I have been asking questions since that interview .
why ? there are still many mistakes between me and this world we are in , and it is also because of those mistakes that enable me to feel the greatness of this world .
see , how distinctive we are .
the people who are present here and who will watch this video can live together in harmony , despite of their distinc@@ tiveness .
what should we do if we , being distinctive , want to live together ?
the solution is to seek understanding .
I often feel that it is easy to fall in love , find a suitable job and succeed in your line of business , but it is really difficult to be understood .
achieving mutual understanding is really scarce .
hence , how do we start to understand each other ?
while bringing about mistakes , in most cases , words are also a useful resort to eliminate mistakes .
as a consequence , there is no better choice but to ask questions haun@@ ting me most one after one .
today &apos;s speech starts with a question of mine , so it is best to end it with a question too .
but I am contempl@@ ating what to ask .
if I were from the China Central Television , I would ask &quot; Are you happy ? &quot;
&quot; yes , I am happy ! . &quot;
I do believe that I am happy right now .
if there is a question I want to ask at the end of this speech , that will be &quot; Do you deserve the happiness that you have ? &quot;
thanks !
I believe you must all be very familiar with this clip from the movie Av@@ atar .
the floating &quot; H@@ all@@ elu@@ jah Mountain &quot; in Av@@ atar , was inspired by the Southern Sky Col@@ umn of Zhang@@ ji@@ aj@@ ie .
the hero , Jake Sul@@ ly , was sent there in the vanguard of occupying the mountain .
however , he later betrayed his fellows and became a warrior for environmental protection .
so here today I want to share with you my story .
seven years ago , I worked as an environmental public relations specialist in a multinational company .
the company owned more than 6 million mu of forest in China and 17 production bases .
it had an annual production capacity of over 7 million tons in pulp and paper and its annual sales could reach 30 billion yuan .
my job in this company was to deal with challenges from all sorts of non @-@ governmental organizations featuring environmental protection and those from media concerning the environment .
when I joined this company , it was right under the spotlight for it had planted e@@ uc@@ aly@@ p@@ tus trees at large scale in Yunnan province and Hainan province , which was strongly protested by NGOs such as Green Peace , Friends of the Earth and Global Village as well as the college student unions of Beijing Forestry University .
members of the Scientific Exploration and Out@@ door Life club of Beijing Forestry University even put on their self @-@ made v@@ ests with our trademark and a black cross on it and they boy@@ cot@@ ted our products in the supermarket .
when some women went to buy our products , they would stop them and say , &quot; Please don &apos;t buy it . it was made out of paper at the expense of primitive forest , at the cost of our environment . &quot;
all @-@ China Environment Federation ( AC@@ EF ) , the largest NGO featuring environmental protection in China back then , sent their powerful lawyers to Zhejiang to support Zhejiang Hotel Association in their law suit against my employer .
my job was to handle those environment @-@ related crises .
as a professional manager , I was pretty much an accomplished man .
I was often invited to lecture in many universities and I also invited lots of students enthusiastic about environmental protection to engage in social practice activities in our forestry bases .
I still remember , in October , 2006 , AC@@ EF hosted its Annual Meeting of Sustainable Development .
the Scientific Exploration and Out@@ door Life society of Beijing Forestry University delivered a speech named Heaven and H@@ ell on behalf of their college counterparts .
they used to protest against us .
however , after my public relation efforts , they changed their stances .
another successful case is that I managed to change the stance of AC@@ EF , turning them from our opponents , our protesters to our fellows and our supporters .
AC@@ EF published a long research report in the form of its internal publication named L@@ ed and Gu@@ ided by Environmental Protection , Paper @-@ Making Can Go Green , in which as a third party , it proved that our company , following closely the industry policies , had taken a path of circular economy .
but it was over its top and our public relation efforts had gone too far , attracting strong protests from multiple NGOs of environmental non @-@ governmental organizations ( EN@@ GO ) .
Liao Xiao@@ yi , a very famous environmental protectionist back then in China , also the head of Beijing Global Village , resigned her direc@@ tor@@ ship from AC@@ EF to protest against us .
however , one battle after another , despite all the victories against those NGOs , I wasn &apos;t happy at all .
I had been thinking .
I worked as an environmental public relations specialist in this company , I was well paid and I stayed in 5 @-@ star hotels , I went on business trips by plane .
I had a high income .
in contrast , what about those people working for those NGOs ?
they took the train and sometimes couldn &apos;t afford a sleep@@ er class .
they might have to live in the host@@ els .
and later I found out that some of them were not paid at all .
they volunteered to do all their work .
but why were they so persistent ?
I asked myself later , for what ?
for themselves ?
no , they did all these to protect our environment for all of us , including for me .
at the end of 2006 , I went back to Hangzhou , my hometown , to gather together with my former classmates .
I started out my career as a journalist , and some of my classmates , also journalists , knew that I was enthusiastic about legal rights protection .
so when they heard that I was then working as environmental PR in a company like that , they said to me in a joking tone , &quot; Yang Ji@@ anch@@ u , how come you turned yourself from a hero of legal rights protection into a traitor ? &quot;
I knew it was a joke but it made me feel really bad .
I was , just like Jake Sul@@ ly in Av@@ atar , stuck in the conflict and confusion of the ideal and the reality , of my profession and the morality .
what should I do ?
as a professional manager , I was supposed to protect the brand of my company .
but to be honest there were certain things I couldn &apos;t talk about .
so I chose to resign on 2@@ 2nd , March , 2007 .
thank you !
now I &apos;ve shifted my role from a PR Manager in a foreign company to an environmental protec@@ tor .
I used to fight against the EN@@ GOs but now I work with them .
since I became a Environ@@ men@@ al protec@@ tor , I later discovered that in China it was really hard for people to be an EN@@ GO volunteer and It was difficult for grass@@ root NGOs to get by .
I &apos;m not here today to tell you how brave I had been , wea@@ thering the risks .
here I am only to tell you one story that is not so far away from Shanghai .
we all know that Mr. Zhu Zi@@ qing once wrote an essay called &quot; Qin hu@@ ai River in the P@@ addle Sound . &quot;
I believe that the Qin hu@@ ai River at that time was very clean , but you could go check out how the river looks like now .
it has become dead water as many enterprises with heavy pollution are situated over there .
it is reported one day that a paper @-@ making factory named Qin@@ hu@@ ai Paper @-@ Making had directly discharged its wastewater into Qin@@ hu@@ ai River , without taking any environmental protection measures .
how dreadful !
so we went to investigate .
during our investigation , the local Environmental Protection Department assured us , &quot; No , there is no such thing , we examined regularly . &quot;
the factory also confirmed , &quot; We &apos;ve never discharged wastewater . &quot;
at that moment , an old man , who was a former employee of the factory , took off his jacket and jumped into the drains , saying , &quot; I need to say it out even if I die today . otherwise my children and my grandchildren will die . &quot;
he pulled out the drain and we found that there were actually two pipes , one was a proper sewer pipe for inspection from people like us .
and another hidden pipe was used to discharge wastewater secretly without any treatment , hence , no treatment cost .
the old man pulled the sewer pipe out and beans were spilled .
the un@@ treated black wastewater just bur@@ sted out .
the man before me asked , &quot; Will the sun rise as usual tomorrow ? &quot;
I believe it will .
but if we don &apos;t cherish our environment or our ecosystem , the ap@@ ocaly@@ pse will soon come .
something happened in my family in 2010 .
my wife fell ill but it was not a serious illness .
so she only needed to go through a little surgery .
but to my shock , while she was having the surgery , the operating room was contaminated .
I knew the environment outside could be contaminated but never thought the contamination could happen inside an operating room .
the surgeon who operated on my wife went on a business trip to Singapore the next day and didn &apos;t return until five days later .
during this period of time , my wife ran a high fever every day and the doctor on duty gave her the best anti @-@ bio@@ tics .
when the surgeon returned from Singapore , he immediately had her stit@@ ches removed , the inside of which was already pur@@ ulent and there were adhes@@ ions .
she then had another two sur@@ ger@@ ies , the second of which resulted in urinary leakage .
do you have any idea of what comes to an adult whose urine leaks ?
he / She has to wear adult di@@ apers for half a year .
as I witnessed my beautiful wife being tor@@ mented by the illness during the three months in hospital , I dreaded that she could at any minute leave me forever .
she stayed with me from the age of 21 wherever I went , with no complaints .
so I was really scared at that moment .
it was during that three months in hospital that I gained more understanding of the environment , health , families and even lives .
I want to find a place with fresh air , green mountains and clean water .
I want my wife and my daughter to live a happy life .
so in the second half of 2010 when my wife recovered from the illness , I took her to An@@ ji city of Hangzhou and lived there for a long time .
in August 2011 , the three of us drove from Guangzhou to Changsha , to Zheng@@ zhou , to Beijing , then we passed by Qingdao , Li@@ any@@ un@@ gang , Gan@@ zhou and then went back to Guangzhou .
we travelled 6@@ 500 miles for 14 days .
in February this year , on 11th of the lunar calendar year , I took my wife to Mount E@@ mei , Sichuan and stayed in W@@ anni@@ an Temple for 3 days .
I had been to many places before I met Zhang@@ ji@@ aj@@ ie .
there I was astonished by the mountains and the water of Zhang@@ ji@@ aj@@ ie .
the concentration of negative oxygen ion in Jin@@ bian Bro@@ ok reaches around 100,000 .
the mountains over there are aston@@ ish@@ ingly beautiful .
later I thought to myself , this is the P@@ each B@@ los@@ som Spring I &apos;ve been searching for .
I need to settle down here , right here in Zhang@@ ji@@ aj@@ ie .
I would like to tell you another story .
when my wife had just recovered , we moved first to Qing@@ yuan , a little town in the suburb of Guangzhou instead of directly to Zhang@@ ji@@ aj@@ ie .
I &apos;m not sure if all of you have heard of this city .
but the name of this city is very beautiful .
the name &quot; Qing@@ yuan &quot; reminds me of a clean river that flows afar .
it &apos;s 60 miles from Guangzhou and has the best hot spring and r@@ afting .
it used to be the backyard garden of Guangzhou .
so originally I thought since the environment and air in Guangzhou weren &apos;t that good , I could move to Qing@@ yuan .
however , not long after we bought an apartment in Qing@@ yuan , Guangdong government introduced a new policy called &quot; Emp@@ ty the cage for new birds . &quot;
&quot; empty the cage for new birds &quot; means moving some of the heavily polluting companies from the developed areas out to peripheral areas .
therefore those heavy pollu@@ ters in Dong@@ guan , Sh@@ un@@ de and F@@ oshan all were then moved to Qing@@ yuan .
so later Qing@@ yuan was surrounded by global waste treatment factory in the south , a cement factory in the north , a porcelain city in east and an electro@@ plating plant in west .
I &apos;m telling you this story here because I don &apos;t want to see Zhang@@ ji@@ ai@@ je become another Qing@@ yuan .
I wouldn &apos;t want to escape from Zhang@@ ji@@ aj@@ ie later .
I &apos;ve founded the W@@ ul@@ ing@@ shan Ecological Environmental Protection Association in Zhang@@ ji@@ aj@@ ie .
I want to guard the last piece of clean land and create a better home for not just myself , my family but also more people out there .
many people asked me , &quot; Yang Ji@@ anch@@ u , why did you give up your well @-@ paid job in a foreign entre@@ prise and choose to work for environmental protection instead ? &quot;
my answer is , &quot; I &apos;m born to join the cause of environmental protection . as my mother &apos;s name is &quot; water &quot; and my father &apos;s is the earth and forest , I &apos;m the son of water , earth and forest ! &quot;
thank you !
here at T@@ n@@ Dao , I &apos;d like to take advantage of this special day to share with you the world view of the Chinese .
on the slide , there is a very long chart .
to be brief , from the chart , you can see the tall columns .
here &apos;s one question for us : &quot; what do you believe in ? &quot;
the tallest column represents the answer of people who &quot; believes in nothing , &quot; which is the main stream among the Chinese people .
however , it is quite interesting to ask these athe@@ ists further .
the reason is that some athe@@ ists say , &quot; Although I believe in nothing , I believe in destiny . &quot;
some say , &quot; Although I believe in nothing , I believe in luck . &quot;
some say , &quot; Although I believe in nothing , I believe in constellation . &quot;
have you got it now ?
this is the so @-@ called athe@@ ists among us .
they are the people who believe in the probability factors , so they cannot be regarded as the real athe@@ ists .
when it comes to the@@ ists , it is also very interesting .
based on the chart , we could notice that the the@@ ists believe in different things .
some people state that they are Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
Budd@@ hi@@ sts account for the largest proportion among the the@@ ists in China , reaching 18 % .
over 2 % of people proclaim that they are Christians while some say they are Cathol@@ ics .
the amount of Christians and Cathol@@ ics in total takes about 10 % .
Budd@@ hi@@ sts occupy the largest proportion for 18 % .
the Budd@@ hi@@ sts are also quite interesting .
someone says : &quot; it &apos;s good that you believe in Buddhism . how much do you know about Buddhism ? &quot;
&quot; A@@ mit@@ ab@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; in addition to A@@ mit@@ ab@@ ha , do you know anything else ? &quot;
&quot; om Man@@ i Pad@@ me H@@ um . &quot;
&quot; anything else ? &quot;
&quot; um @-@ um . I &apos;m sorry . I really don &apos;t know . Buddhism is all about doing good deeds , accumulating virtue and showing magn@@ anim@@ ity . &quot;
well , only 0.4 % of people have read some scrip@@ tures .
for example , some Budd@@ hi@@ sts may learn about the Great Comp@@ assion Man@@ tra , or they have read it , who are already considered knowledgeable .
most people say that they have faith in Buddhism .
how do they show their faith ?
if there is a temple , they will enter the temple and say that they know the bod@@ his@@ at , but cannot tell out the name .
after entering the temple , they &apos;ll buy a bunch of inc@@ enses .
then , they will place one stick in front of each Bo@@ d@@ his@@ att@@ va .
how does that work ?
I also don &apos;t know , because I don &apos;t know what this Bo@@ d@@ his@@ att@@ va is in charge for and I don &apos;t know their responsibilities .
you see .
however , to play safe , one stick is placed in front of each de@@ ity statue .
after all , inc@@ enses won &apos;t cost a lot .
for example , 10 yuan for one bunch .
the cost of very two sticks is very low , isn &apos;t it ?
I recently invested a total of 3@@ 50,000 yuan to buy stocks .
the price of stocks tends to rise .
I wish it won &apos;t go down next Monday .
if the price goes up next Monday , I will sell out on Tuesday .
the inc@@ enses bought in 10 yuan are expected to bless you with 100,000 yuan .
what is the ratio of input to output ?
so some of us regard de@@ ities as fools .
it is unlikely that the de@@ ities are more foolish than the ordinary people .
you buy a bunch of inc@@ enses in ten yuan and just give two sticks to each de@@ ity , but you ask for two percent of price increase of your stock in return .
however , many of the followers of fai@@ ths just think in this way .
they ens@@ la@@ ve the de@@ ities and claim , &quot; I believe in Buddhism ! &quot;
Christians are a little better , because 94 % of Christians have read the Bible .
in comparison of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts and Christians , the amount of Christians is less but Christians know much more about their religion .
however , there are also some mud@@ d@@ le@@ headed people among Christians !
many Christians also say , &quot; Dear God , the Buddha which I used to believe in is not efficient , so I often lost the money in the stock market . later , I heard that you are omni@@ potent . as you are omni@@ potent , you must also be the God of the stock market . is that correct ? therefore , I have decided to believe in you and hope you can help increase the price of stock by two percent within one week . also , I know that you are better than the Bo@@ d@@ his@@ att@@ va , because you don &apos;t even need me to offer inc@@ enses . it &apos;s much better to believe in you , because the price of my stock can rise by two percent without any expense . &quot;
therefore , when some people believe in one religion , they want something in return .
essentially , for many people , the faith is merely a tool to fulfill their material needs and a tool to help realize their will .
so if we observe the the@@ ism and athe@@ ism together , we will find that either of them is quite special , in a Chinese characteristic way .
we don &apos;t judge here , but in my opinion , it &apos;s good that people have fai@@ ths .
what advantages do people with faith get ?
people who believe in positive power usually have some positive pursuits .
as you all know , regardless of their fai@@ ths , the@@ ists usually believe that it &apos;s right to do some good deeds , because every kind of de@@ ity is pleased to have people do so .
this is the faith .
in addition , some people don &apos;t know whether there is a God or de@@ ity , but they believe the existence of ghosts .
there is one advantage of believing in ghosts , because people will believe in hell or the under@@ world .
in hell , there are various punishments , including ste@@ aming , frying , b@@ raising , ro@@ asting , and nowadays they can cook you on a iron gri@@ d@@ dle or with electric devices .
therefore , it comes to his mind , &quot; Gos@@ h ! why are people suffering from these punishments ? &quot;
someone tells him , &quot; Do you know that if people commit this kind of crimes , they &apos;ll be steamed ; if they commit that kind of crimes , they &apos;ll be sliced . &quot;
then , he &apos;ll say to himself , &quot; No , I &apos;d better do some good deeds and do nothing evil . otherwise , I will end up being made into a Man@@ chu Han Imperial Fe@@ ast . right ? &quot;
so , if there is something horrible , you &apos;ll fear about it .
it is true for human being .
in the following minutes , I would like to share some particularly interesting ideas with you .
what are the Chinese people afraid of on earth ?
we may say that the Chinese fear nothing , but in fact , there are some@@ things that we do fear .
what are Chinese people particularly afraid of ?
firstly , diseases . the most fearful things are diseases .
besides , Chinese fear that their relatives fall ill .
that is something .
what is the second dreadful thing ?
becoming impoverished .
what else ?
to lose the social position and be despised by others .
anything else ?
Chinese are afraid of being misunderstood by friends among others .
it &apos;s quite interesting if we compare the Chinese with the American .
what do the Chinese fear most ?
first it is poverty .
then they fear sickness .
of course , they fear also the war .
in addition , they are afraid of loneliness .
as for Americans , what &apos;re they afraid of ?
snakes .
in addition to snakes , Americans are also afraid of spiders .
27 % of Americans are afraid of spiders .
rats are another dreadful thing for Americans .
then , the Americans are afraid of public speeches .
they are very afraid of being asked to speak in the public .
anything else ?
they are scared of heights .
what else ?
being closed in a small room .
I &apos;m just giving some examples to tell you that the Chinese and the American are really different .
as human being , from a humanistic point of view , Chinese and Americans have great differences , i.e. , their fears .
at least what Americans fear are physical .
for example , firstly , they are more scared of animals than we are .
in addition , they are afraid of narrow spaces , height , planes , injections and other things .
however , different from us who fear for poverty and diseases , Americans are less afraid of things related to human beings .
in my speech today , I don &apos;t want to over@@ stress the differences between the two people .
instead , how should we deal with our fears ?
among all the fears , many audiences here today may have ac@@ roph@@ obia .
there is a World Financial Center not far away from us .
the 100@@ th floor of the center is equipped with transparent glass @-@ floor walk@@ ways , so it &apos;s a fearful place for many people , including me .
my psycho@@ therapist told me , &quot; Do you know ? there is only one solution to ac@@ roph@@ obia : facing the height . &quot;
but I can &apos;t face it .
later , there came a chance . I said to myself that I had to face it for at least one time , so one year , I went to Canada to be the tourism ambassador of Canadian entrepreneurs .
it was in 2010 .
there was a over 1,000 meters &apos; air ride suspension which was called &quot; Z@@ ip chuck &quot; between two mountain peaks .
tourists move through the zip chuck from one mountain peak to another .
at the beginning , I was twisted , because I was that kind of person who would freeze and become completely unable to move at high altitudes .
in addition , I found that my legs were so feeble that I could hardly stand , and I had a strong desire to jump off .
as you know , this is the most severe symptom of ac@@ roph@@ obia .
the patient with ac@@ roph@@ obia is so scared of height that he hopes to lower it through jumping off .
as people feel uncertain at high altitude , only reaching the ground rapidly can they feel assured .
is it right ?
therefore , the extremely severe ac@@ roph@@ obia can force people to jump off buildings .
I was almost at the verge of the extreme fear at that time .
when I sli@@ ded to the opposite side , I felt much better .
then , when I got back , my mood was further appe@@ ased .
therefore , I went back and forth for seven times .
so , if people want to exceed their own capabilities , they need the help .
this is why the second point that I &apos;m going to talk about is important .
in 1992 , we first made study on the importance of supernatural powers or religious beliefs that transc@@ ended natural forces among all the values for humans .
we conducted the first investigation in 1995 and the second one was in 2007 .
after almost 12 years of investigation , we found that in comparison with other countries , the Chinese in general stress less importance on belief .
however , there is a great improvement compared to that in 1995 .
in terms of trajectory , Chinese are paying more attention to fai@@ ths .
however , one reality about belief remains unchanged , that is the features of our motive .
one feature of our religious motive is tha we claim to believe in nothing while in fact we seem to believe in everything .
this is the mainstream way of belief among Chinese people .
for choosing the belief , the priority is whether the belief can work for us , which is very important .
when we regard the de@@ ities , whether the al@@ mighty God of the Heaven or the H@@ ell who is the chef of Man@@ chu Han Imperial Fe@@ ast , as someone who work for us , I think it is necessary to talk about the dignity of human beings that Mr.@@ Hu just talked about .
many people will ask what is dignity ?
is dignity always a legacy of a certain racial culture ?
not exactly .
it seems to me that in addition to some cultural herit@@ ance , more importantly , the dignity comes from the fer@@ vent pursuit for a certain power from the inner heart so that the people conduct in a way different from the ordinary people .
for instance , still in her teens , Mother Teresa decided to devote her entire life to God and serve the people .
in the n@@ un society of Mother Teresa , many young females were born with silver spo@@ ons , some of course came from the impoverished families .
they didn &apos;t marry or seek any own benefits .
instead , they helped others .
they also had an interesting working mode .
nowadays , it &apos;s hard to raise fund for public welfare .
for them , they only raised food for their weekly needs and raised funds for children they were helping .
if a rich man came , saying , &quot; W@@ ow , it &apos;s too hard for you to raise the money . I will give you $ 8@@ 00,000 at once ! &quot;
they would respond , &quot; Sorry , we can &apos;t take it , because we only raise the money we deserve . &quot;
what would they eat next week ?
they said : &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter , God will prepare adequate supply for us next week . if we have so many resources , I am afraid we will be corrupted . &quot;
OK , this is the positive pursuit .
however , some people will be affected by fear , because they are afraid that they will go to hell , be punished and be beyond redemption in the future .
also , some people believe in their chance to rein@@ car@@ nate and fear that they will turn to a dog or a pig in the nex life , so they choose not to face such a prospect .
I think , the power of faith allows us to transcend our knowledge and our own limited information and abilities to observe things outside our scope , and give yourself a relatively definitive answer .
this definitive answer defines the scope and the mode of action for us .
once the mode is defined , one of the largest benefits is that people can easily identify you when they interact with you .
human is an action subject full of prob@@ abilities , speculation , opportunity and uncertainty .
as for every one , dignity is out of the question , but occasionally , noble behaviors cannot be ruled out .
generally speaking , human is highly uncertain .
we can &apos;t simply judge whether the high uncertainty is good or not , because high uncertainty can bring a lot of advantages , including to the readiness to reform , openness to the novel things , enthusiasm for fashion and fashionable items .
the high uncertainty indeed is an important indicator for the openness .
however , since we don &apos;t have faith , we lack the rules , models that people can clearly identify .
sometimes , people don &apos;t have a bottom line because people don &apos;t know what the bottom line is .
in many cases , the bottom line is defined by faith .
in conclusion : please believe in something , every one !
of course you can believe in the existence of a more positive supernatural power .
also , you can believe in God or other positive supernatural powers .
if you really don &apos;t believe in anything , you can at least believe that there are dev@@ ils , ghosts or some powers , which can punish people by frying , cooking or boiling .
therefore , we have developed some pursuits and abilities to face the uncertainty in front us .
or , due to our fear , we constrain our cap@@ ric@@ ious behaviors .
either way , they made the the@@ ists @-@ ish behave in a more human way .
because once a person breaks the upper limit or the bottom line , he looks horrible and less human .
therefore , fai@@ ths can indicate whether we are human or not and which kind of people we are .
thank you all !
let &apos;s start by a story .
about 10 years ago , I was invited to a prestigious hospital in Beijing to give a lecture to mothers among medical staff on early childhood education .
after the lecture , several mothers came to consult me in line about breast @-@ feeding .
after we all finished discussions , they just sat aside and chat@@ ted .
at that time , a mother who was at the end of the line , slipped towards me to consult in a very low voice about her daughter &apos;s personality problem .
according to her , the 5 @-@ year @-@ old girl was particularly intro@@ verted .
for example , in kindergarten , she was never a volunteer to raise hands .
moreover , when they went out and met their neighbors or acquaintances , she would not greet actively or just ignore them and their questions .
when there were guests at home , she also refused to give a show anyway .
her mother was so worried that she asked me what to do .
then I looked around and said , &quot; Well , here are all your acquaintances , just five or six colleagues you know very well , could you please sing a song to us ? &quot;
she was stunned at first , and then smiled with great embarrassment .
thus I said , &quot; Look , how can you ask a child to do something you cannot do ? &quot;
after that , as I have witnessed so many similar cases , what once seemed bewil@@ dering will no longer be so .
as long as parents came to me to complain about their children &apos;s faults , usually including being intro@@ ver@@ sive , cowardly , timid , impres@@ sible , not graceful , not optimistic , not lively , un@@ sociable , aggressive , dis@@ obedient , stubborn , snack @-@ addicted , hyper@@ active , distr@@ acti@@ ble or not interested in sport , I always asked such a question : &quot; does there anybody in your family have the same qualities ? &quot;
the mere response was always an embarrassed smile .
more words then were not necessary as those people knew the answer clearly .
however , some might be reluctant to admit the facts and replied that &quot; Nob@@ ody in my family behaves in that way . how unlucky to have such an awkward child ! &quot;
I just showed amiable smile without words and looked directly at them .
after a while they would also smiled embarr@@ asse@@ dly .
or furthermore , some still denied and attributed all the faults to their elder generations such as grand@@ p@@ as and grand@@ mas .
in no way would they admit their own deficiencies and others should be blamed .
how unfair it is !
the elder generations who voluntarily took care of grand@@ sons or grand@@ daughters but simply received complaints .
and they even could not defend themselves due to absence .
why ?
because I found a secret , that is , children are born to grow and study through the most important way , imitation .
this is not a new idea , but instead has long been agreed in the academic circles .
however , the physiological explanations of this phenomenon were clarified in the mid @-@ 1990s by a group of Italian scientists .
they found that in the pre@@ motor cortex of our brain were some special neurons .
when we saw someone doing something , these neurons became active , as if we were doing the same things by ourselves .
so scientists have named them as &quot; mirror neurons . &quot;
&quot; mirror &quot; refers to something that can reflect other things in our daily life .
relevant researches have been a hot topic in recent 20 years and yielded fruitful results .
then back to the story of the nurse mother I mentioned .
she asked me : &quot; my daughter &apos;s case that she will not greet actively or just ignore others really embarrassed me , could you please give me some advice ? &quot;
hence I replied , &quot; Have you ever set a model for her to imitate ? &quot;
the mother said , &quot; I think she &apos;s already five years old and should be mature enough without our guidance . &quot;
I added , &quot; If you don &apos;t teach and influence her by your word and deed , no matter how old she is , it &apos;s impossible for her to teach herself how to deal with the relationship with other@@ s.@@ If you cannot offer a model to imitate , but just expect your child to be more optimistic , graceful and polite , moreover , criticize her otherwise , it &apos;s not fair indeed . &quot;
there was nothing wrong with my advice to this mother .
but ten years later , it seemed to be a very superficial proposal .
because according to studies of mirror neurons and children &apos;s psychological development , children do not imitate others mechanically , or specifically , actions of adults .
instead , they have a special ability to sensi@@ tively capture others &quot; intentions and corresponding consequences , which are the two sources of their imitation .
what &apos;s more , babies who were born just two days ago have already endowed with superpower to figure out cries out of or without real emotions .
only after identifying real cries from other babies , they will follow to cry .
it is hard to understand , especially for parents , that children not only imitate your actions , but also your inner voice .
a difficult point indeed .
why ?
because we have accustomed to bury our inner voice deeply and put on the &quot; masks &quot; that are recognized by others or the society .
mostly , we are confused , numb or not sure about our true hearts .
but children have such magic to read your minds and use their power to destroy our perfect &quot; masks . &quot;
here is another simple case , also the most common one .
in the morning , mothers send their children to the kindergarten .
especially in September every year , namely a start of a new school year , we always see children resisting to let mothers go , seeming to cry in deep grieve and with great noise .
such cries even impress others around that &quot; Is her a natural mother or step@@ mother ? how cruel she is to insist on leaving her child here ! &quot;
well , as mothers have to go to work , saying goodbye is a must .
they may turn round look back repeatedly at every step .
but when mothers just disappear from children &apos;s sights , children would stop crying and have a good time with teachers and classmates .
such joy will last until their mothers pick them up in the afternoon .
however , the next morning will witness another extremely sorrow@@ ful farewell play .
what are the reasons behind ?
let &apos;s first leave aside other factors and also exclude that kindergarten is a place where children are abused , in other words , just a normal place .
but why ?
because children reflect true state of adults &quot; minds .
it means that not children but their mothers hate to part .
therefore , emotions of mothers in that case , precisely anxiety , confusion , worry and guilt , are exactly captured by their children .
in that sense , I often say to parents , &quot; Don &apos;t dwell on your children &apos;s shortcomings all the time . those faults that disgust you always be with yourselves . &quot;
children are mirrors of adults , or to be more precise , mirrors to reveal inner monsters , which can reflect that under gorgeous appearance , what is shady in our minds .
they can directly demonstrate &quot; the emperor &apos;s new clothes &quot; in our cases , leaving us no way and nowhere to hide our shame .
I said earlier that now I become in@@ ured to such cases .
sometimes , I did not listen to parents , or did not listen too much , because they cannot get to the point .
how can a confused person state his mind clearly ?
if so , let me meet your child and everything will be abundantly clear .
I know present here are bosses , CEO or the management .
here is my suggestion .
you can send HR managers to my training courses .
after that , when you recruit new employees , interviews for adults can be then followed by casual meetings with their children .
a brilliant and efficient method that out@@ weighs all the test results !
today , I &apos;m not just talking about children .
in fact , imitation is our human nature as well as a great en@@ abl@@ er to promote social development psych@@ ologically .
it doesn &apos;t mean that we don &apos;t imitate each other when grow up .
mirror neurons exist in each brain of us .
that is to say , we adults also serve as mirrors and imitate each other .
corresponding researches began more than 100 years ago in terms of psychology .
however , recently , brain science and cran@@ ial nerves have been further studied , so that our understanding of mutual imitation has been developed as well .
moreover , scientists have found that we adults do not only imitate actions but also , say , languages , including accent , tone and manner of speaking .
we also imitate each other &apos;s expressions .
if you stay with a smiling person , naturally you will smile more .
otherwise , being always with a rigid face will unconsciously pass on negative mood to you .
the most important thing is that we not only imitate these superficial , or tangible things .
actually , what we really imitate from each other is our emotions , feelings , judgments and values .
well , it is far beyond a simple thing as we expected .
that is to say , whether we accept , realize or admit it or not , every word , every action , even every thought of each of us affects others , and then further the whole society .
now some may argue strongly : &quot; what you have said is totally exaggeration ! how on earth can we have an influence on the whole society ? &quot;
my answer is that surely you can .
we should ditch the dog@@ ma that influential figures in the society are merely those celebrities , politicians , big names or in our childhood , heroes , role models and idols that our teachers told us .
in fact , they are goals out of reach .
the real influ@@ entials are exactly the people around us in life .
in conclusion , in our life , we should only do what is worth being im@@ itated .
thank you !
this is a manuscript of B@@ ach that tells a piece of music .
in my eyes , this piece of music is a program .
the staff , the scale , the rhythm and the length of it are just like a program that could generate a piece of beautiful music if it is properly pres@@ et .
the program can be transmitted into our ears through the instrument players .
just like computers added with programs can finally deliver us beautiful results .
the computer programs are about beauty , music and image .
and what else ?
look at this .
can you understand it ?
no .
but this is the routines for me every day .
all day long , I will be facing with these codes .
do these codes have anything to do with us ?
it is closely related to us .
it has greatly changed our life .
what does it mean then ?
these code sections above translate into my email address .
each of us is now communicating with each other by email every day .
not only words but also speech and images make our communication more convenient .
you use the intel@@ ligible characters below .
while people like us working on computers and programming use the abstr@@ use codes above .
it was because that we work with abstr@@ use codes that people are now able to communicate in a convenient way .
therefore , the beauty of the program is first and foremost the beauty of convenience , which makes things convenient for us .
here is a classic example in the software industry .
in ancient Indian temples , there was a prophecy among many monks that when all the 64 pieces of Golden plates , called Tower of Han@@ oi , were moved one by one to the pillar on the right , the ap@@ ocaly@@ pse would come .
this is the legend simulated by computer programs .
let &apos;s see , the movement one by one at the bottom is the simplest and most basic movement to move a Golden plate from Tower of Han@@ oi .
this is a combined action .
assuming that one Golden plate is moved to the right pillar in every second , while meeting the requirement that all the smaller ones must be on top of the bigger ones , so the operation is a very complicated process .
you may have a look at how many seconds this process will take after the algorithm is executed .
the red part shows that it will take 5@@ 85 billion years .
however , we can see that a second @-@ to @-@ second action that takes more than 500 billion years could be simulated with a simple program .
at present , how long does it take to realize it with the fastest computer in the world ?
only a few seconds .
therefore , the second beauty of programming is that it takes over a lot of repetitive labor work with high efficiency .
this is the beauty of efficiency .
this is the most beautiful program in the computer science industry .
what is the final result of this program ?
hello world , the first program that all students ma@@ jo@@ red in computer science need to learn when they just started college .
it is the same for students all over the world .
the first program is &quot; Hello , World . &quot;
why is it the first program ?
because computer programs are not for person @-@ to @-@ computer or computer @-@ to @-@ computer , but for humans to communicate with others again with programs .
after the simplest program , let &apos;s take a look at some variations of this program , one of which is h@@ acker .
to put it in a simple way , this program on the left wants to tell us whether x equals 0 or 1 , and then to have it printed on the screen .
as we all know , the value of x is equal to 1 , then the screen will show 1 , which is a normal program .
how do hackers do ?
a sentence is added to the normal program , the red part .
you may not understand what is after this sentence .
if we can , then we will all become hackers .
however , this passage has made a difference .
the program still thinks that x is equal to 1 , but when printing , it gives out the result of 0 .
the h@@ acker &apos;s program hij@@ acked a normal program and ran according to the h@@ acker &apos;s idea .
everyone said that it could be a mere drama irrelevant to ourselves .
in what way does it have to do with our work and life ?
in fact , there is something to do with it .
for example , I talked with my superior today . I felt that my idea was not quite supported by him .
I decided to skip him and report to our boss .
after I went over my superior &apos;s head and reported to his boss , I received his positive comments .
he would arrange my leader to implement it .
by getting over your superior &apos;s head , you executed a h@@ acker program .
of course , it seems a bit problematic if you go behind your superior &apos;s back for personal benefits , but if you do it for public profits , it may be worth praising .
therefore , h@@ acker programs are also common in our life .
another program is elevator dispatching .
how does the elevator get us down ?
how is the program written in it ?
in the past , there was the simplest algorithm .
that is , anyone who presses it earlier will be served first .
so the ones on the 16th floor came down first , then people on the 29th floor and fin@@ aly people on the 19th floor .
have you notice anything wrong with this process ?
at last they all came down , but the guy on the 9@@ 3rd floor was getting impatient , because only the elevator could only carry one person at a time .
everyone said that this was a stupid elevator , so the first @-@ come @-@ first @-@ serve algorithm proves to be an inefficient program .
now we see the elev@@ ators &apos;s algorithm has begun to perform according to different situation .
there could be the elev@@ ators to higher floors or lower floors , to the odd @-@ number floors and even @-@ number floors , which will make it more efficient for us .
of course , there are also intelligent genetic algorithms .
after running many times , it is found that the elevator can wait on the first floor from 8 to 9 am , when most people go to work .
at noon every day it waits on the floor where it used to have the most people going down .
it thus becomes a program operating elev@@ ators according to experience , and it is becoming more and more intelligent .
let &apos;s look at such a picture .
keep drawing it and what will we get ?
make a little change and it will be so beautiful !
where does the beauty of this program come from ?
not simplicity , but the effective and simple replication .
after numerous repl@@ ications , this will produce what we see in a lot of Hollywood block@@ bu@@ sters , with thousands upon thousands of robots coming in all directions .
that &apos;s how a lot of wonderful images are made , through perfect extensive replication of easy movements .
many enterprises , especially chain enterprises of global brands are like this .
when we go to each of its stores , the services we enjoy are almost the same , with universal enthusiasm , tone and languages .
that &apos;s a very simple action , but we repl@@ icates it for numerous times .
so that &apos;s another beauty of programming , the replication .
I will show you four small programs .
let &apos;s look at the first one , which is called accumulation algorithm .
the green part means my starting point , when I just graduated .
the red one is my goal in the future , maybe in 10 years , even 50 years , or my goal in life .
the goal is achi@@ ved with the accumulation algorithm .
let &apos;s look at the second one .
check it out .
it &apos;s so fast .
nice !
I reached my goal at one blow .
now everyone in this society is desperately hoping to win the lottery or someone will send a million yuan to their home and say , &quot; This is legal , so take it ! . &quot;
that is convenient , so it is called &quot; a greedy program . &quot;
this is a short @-@ term target .
I find the nearest target , and I run towards it , so you can see that the algorithm runs very fast .
however , life is not always so pleasant .
it is not that simple and lucky , with nothing in the way and a broad way ahead .
rather , there will be many walls , many setbacks , which you have to bypass .
then let &apos;s see what will happen when the accumulation algorithm and greedy algorithm meet obstacles .
here is the accumulation algorithm in execution .
you will find that it simply ignores these obstacles and walls .
it still continues to accumulate all these knowledge and capabilities in despite the tr@@ udge , and finally reaches its goal .
let &apos;s look at the greedy algorithm .
when it starts to execute , it runs into walls and retre@@ ats , before finally finding a route .
then for us , our life is a big program .
there could be small programs in every period of life .
which should I choose ?
one of the most striking beau@@ ties of programming is the choice making .
everyone has one &apos;s own life and one &apos;s own choices for different times .
these choices constitute people &apos;s life as long as they are appropriate .
so the choice itself is beauty !
finally , I want to tell you what the most beautiful program is like .
the most beautiful program has a soul .
what you see is not cold computers and software .
you can feel that it has a soul facing you .
the most beautiful program is to face the world together with each of us .
it is willing to smile at the world with you .
that &apos;s the most beautiful program !
now you will understand why the most beautiful program is &quot; Hello world . &quot;
&quot; there is nothing difficult for us to do in the world . if we deal with them , difficult things become easy ; if we don &apos;t , the easy things become difficult . &quot;
I believe you are all familiar with the saying .
it &apos;s from an article in a junior high school textbook entitled , &apos; To Learn . &quot;
the article tells us a very simple lesson that there is no such things as difficult or easy .
if you take action , difficult things will become easier ; otherwise , easy things will become difficult to accomplish later .
these things happen to us often , don &apos;t they ?
we all have lots of dreams that we want to achieve as kids , but how many dreams are fulfilled ?
I heard a story about a girl named R@@ ain at the U.S. Pavilion during the 2010 World Expo .
she found a tr@@ ashed vacant in her neighborhood that was full of construction waste .
so she wondered if it was possible to change that area into a beautiful garden ?
she took action .
she took a pot of flowers from her home and planted them there .
when she was about to plant the second one , she found her flowers were stepped on by a group of teenage hip@@ sters in her neighborhood .
however , she didn &apos;t give up .
she continued to keep planting flowers .
after a while , her action moved the once indifferent neighbors in her community and they carried out the re@@ contr@@ uc@@ tion plan of the beautiful garden together .
in addition , every household in the community started planting flowers on their balcon@@ ies , making the whole community more lively and colorful .
I don &apos;t know how you felt after watching the video , but what I thought was , &quot; Will things like this ever happen in our country ? will things like this ever happen in my community ? &quot;
about six months later after watching the video , I went to Shenzhen for a volunteer project on June 2011 .
I visited a very beautiful beach called X@@ ich@@ ong beach , in Nan &apos;@@ ao county , Shenzhen .
at that time , the beach was not fully commerci@@ alized , so there were only gu@@ es@@ thous@@ es .
young people liked to camp there on the beach , and numerous tents were pitched along the one @-@ kilometer @-@ long coastline .
we call it Chinese @-@ style camping , but what exactly is that ?
you may have guessed it .
when the young people left , they left many things behind . like what ?
garbage .
yeah , they left , but they also left the garbage behind them .
some of them even buried the garbage in the sand .
so later people could hurt their feet when stepping on the garbage .
I went there to swim , but when I saw what it looked like I hesitated .
can I swim in a sea like this ?
the waves came up and swept away a plastic bowl of instant noodles .
then another wave came and carried away some cigarette but@@ ts .
if I swam in there , with one breath I might take in half of the noodles , and with another breath three cigarette but@@ ts .
I couldn &apos;t swim in there .
should I just leave or take action ?
I thought about R@@ ain and decided to take action .
I wanted every visitor on the beach to clean it with me .
I started to observe and found several groups of people packing up to leave .
I ran over to help them and find out their leader .
a girl shouted , &quot; Don &apos;t forget your stuff . &quot;
Oh , she must be someone in charge .
you know , I went towards her to be the considerate Shanghai guy and I helped carry her bags .
I carried her bags to their meeting point and she thanked me , &quot; Thank you ! which group are you in ? &quot;
then she told me that people there were not from the same company , but were online friends who gathered together for a party .
they didn &apos;t know each other very well .
&quot; I am not with you guys , I am just a visitor . &quot; I replied .
&quot; wow ! that &apos;s very kind of you . &quot;
&quot; but I am here as a volunteer . &quot;
&quot; a volunteer ? volunteer for what ? &quot;
&quot; I am here as a volunteer to recruit more volunteers . &quot;
&quot; recruit them for what ? &quot;
&quot; it was nice of you to collect and take your garbage away , but you see , the beach is still very dirty , right ? &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
&quot; so is it possible for all of you to stay here for one more hour and clean the beach with me ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we have enough time because we are gather for meals and we have a training after that . plus , our leader is not around , he went to find the bus . &quot;
so , I got rejected .
I insisted .
&quot; how about this ? let &apos;s make a bet . if I win , all of you will collect garbage with me , but if I lose , I will do it by myself . &quot;
I wasn &apos;t really trying to make a bet .
I just wanted to draw people &apos;s attention and let them know that , as a volunteer I don &apos;t quit easily .
I went back to my place and grabbed a board game that we invented by ourselves .
it &apos;s called &apos; Green Wal@@ king , &quot; to remind us to protect the environment and travel using low carbon emissions .
so I told her male companions , &quot; If any of you can rip the board game &apos;s cloth apart , you win . if you can &apos;t , I win . &quot;
a few guys tried , but failed .
of course , because the cloth was made of special materials .
apparently , I won the bet .
eventually , their leader came back .
so I asked him , &quot; Excuse me , can you please do me a favor ? would you let them stay for an hour and do some voluntary work ? &quot;
&quot; I am really sorry , but we don &apos;t have the time , &quot; he replied .
I got rejected again .
then I insisted , &quot; So how about half an hour ? &quot;
&quot; I am really sorry but our bus has arrived . and the AC on the bus is already on . &quot;
&quot; so 15 minutes ? &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s talk about it . &quot;
some of them were actually touched because of my persistence at the time .
one of the guys came forward and said , &quot; Fi@@ f@@ teen minutes is okay . come on , let &apos;s do it ! &quot;
what he said moved his fellows and eventually all of them decided to join us .
it took me about 15 minutes to persuaded 30 people to help collect garbage on the beach and they actually enjoyed it .
on top of that , I could only have them for 15 minutes since Shanghai people are known for keeping their promises .
so how could I finish cleaning a coastline of one kil@@ o meter ?
at that time , I was different from who I used to be .
you can see a picture in the lower right corner .
there was a two meters high platform with 20 persons sitting on it eating sun@@ flower seeds and tos@@ sing the h@@ ulls onto the beach .
I walked over to them and asked , &quot; Hey guys , can you clean the area in front of you so that we can move on to the next spot ? &quot;
&quot; who are you ? &quot;
&quot; we are volunteers , all of us . &quot;
a guy , whose name I believe was Jack , jumped down .
there was also a woman beside him , whose name was probably Rose , jumped afterwards .
&quot; you jump , I jump . &quot;
after seeing them jump down and with 30 of us staring at them , the other guys felt embarrassed and decided to join us .
next thing you know , 50 people were picking up trash with me .
the group leader was later very happy and asked the others to put the garbage in a pile and take a photo together .
you may think that was the end .
but no .
I asked the group leader , &quot; Boss , we cleaned the beach today , do you think the beach will stay clean tomorrow ? &quot;
he replied , &quot; No , I don &apos;t think so . but there &apos;s nothing we can do . &quot;
I asked , &quot; Look , there is a wall on the dam , and it &apos;s grey . what do you say we paint some green gr@@ aff@@ iti on the wall , calling for everyone to protect the environment on the beach ? &quot;
he answered , &quot; That &apos;ll be great ! we have two people in the group who can draw . &quot;
so I said , &quot; Okay . I &apos;ll get the materials and you get the pain@@ ters . &quot;
do you want to know what happened a month later ?
one month later , 100 volunteers came back and painted a 36 @-@ meter long wall .
the story is far from over because those people enjoyed it too much .
six months after that , they thought the painting they did six months before was too subtle .
when they came back , they found a 50 @-@ meter long wall and drew a painting based on the theme , &quot; Bec@@ ome friends with fish and take away your garbage . &quot;
many people said to me , &quot; Zhang Ning , you &apos;re so stubborn . only people like you would do something like that . what a stupid idea . &quot;
actually , we often hear things like this when doing volunte@@ ering work .
what stops us from taking action ?
it &apos;s thoughts like , &quot; I can &apos;t do it alone if no one supports me . &quot;
or &quot; I can &apos;t make it by myself without the help from others . &quot;
we always talk about other people .
let me tell you a story about one of our volunteers .
she is a 30 @-@ year @-@ old woman from Shanghai and her name is Wang Yan .
she was one of our first batch of volunteers for the campaign &quot; S@@ mile for 100 days . &quot;
&quot; smile for 100 days &quot; lets volunteers go into impoverished areas in the mountains to help kids have fun reading books .
each of them stays there for 100 days .
she was sent to Guizhou province , a place so remote that there aren &apos;t any cars .
her health condition wasn &apos;t very good , yet she had to walk in the mountains every day .
when she had the idea , she told her families and it was natural that they didn &apos;t approve .
take a look at this video please .
she went there anyway , but I &apos;m sure you want to know if she got her mother &apos;s support in the end ?
well when she arrived in Guizhou , her mother was still not relieved .
however , her mother &apos;s friend said , &quot; You &apos;re lucky because your daughter has a dream and is willing to chase it , even though it &apos;s a lot of work . I arranged everything for my son , so he doesn &apos;t have to worry about anything , but he is not happy and is depressed . &quot;
what her friends said worked , so she told Wang Yan , &quot; Be safe and do whatever makes you happy . &quot;
moreover , after Wang Yan reached Guizhou , many of her friends found out that she went there to volunteer .
so they wired her money , added credit to her phone and told her , &quot; We can &apos;t go , so have fun with the kids for us . &quot;
in fact , all of the opposing voices can actually help us think about the true meaning of our actions .
if you want support from other people , let everyone know what they are supporting . not because you &apos;re pretty or handsome , but because you stand behind the meaning of your actions .
so as long as you take action and you can prove that you are walking in the right direction , people will naturally support you .
this is just one case .
there &apos;s also another .
the person in the picture is Wu Hai@@ gang who is Malaysian Chinese .
ten years ago , he saw a public interest ad on TV about teaching in impoverished areas in western China .
he was very touched .
he decided to go to Yunnan and teach kids .
of course he got rejected when he told his wife about the idea .
she said , &quot; You &apos;re too old for this . why can &apos;t you just chill and take good care of yourself . &quot;
he didn &apos;t know how to do this anyway , so he said , &quot; Okay . let &apos;s wait and see . &quot;
after waiting for ten years , he thought that he couldn &apos;t wait any longer .
he thought , &quot; It won &apos;t be long before I leave this world . I don &apos;t have time to wait &quot;
since last year , he started doing one thing .
what was that ?
he told everyone he met that he wanted to teach in Yunnan province and asked if they could help him .
a friend of mine introduced him to me . so he came to me and said , &quot; Zhang Ning , I want to teach in Yunnan . &quot;
&quot; why do you want to teach in under @-@ resour@@ ced areas ? &quot; I asked .
&quot; although I &apos;m a overseas Chinese , I &apos;m still Chinese .
I want to im@@ migrate to Yunnan so that I can help those kids get a decent education &quot; he answered .
his words deeply touched me .
I said , &quot; Well , I haven &apos;t done any projects like that , but I &apos;m touched by what you just said so I will help you . &quot;
I found four public interest organizations : smile Book Class@@ room , Love Contribu@@ tion , D@@ andeli@@ on Library and Yong@@ ning Study Assistance .
based on his needs , we mapped out a nice volunteer campaign together and named it &quot; S@@ mile for 100 days . &quot;
the volunteers went there to help children find the joy in reading and let them fall in love with books .
the teachers told us that we truly helped the kids and ligh@@ tened their burdens .
the volunteers were happy , the teachers were happy and the kids were happy .
I shared four stories with you .
did you notice what they all have in common ?
it &apos;s that when we first had ideas and when we were ready to take action , we actually had nothing .
nobody gave us money or said they would follow us , but we took action anyway .
because we know that if we act , we will get what we want .
Wang Yan told me something quite profound .
she said , &quot; So many things in my life were going against me , but the trips to Yunnan and Guizhou were quite smooth . &quot;
why ?
&quot; since my departure , I feel like I &apos;m a magnet with positive energy and all of the resources are attracted to me . &quot; she answered .
I am very honored to have invited the heroes of my two stories here today .
please welcome Wang Yan and Wu Hai@@ gang .
hello , everyone .
I just want to say , &quot; I hope that each of us can find our own inner light , stay firm and take off ! &quot;
&quot; because tomorrow will soon become yesterday , so we need to seize the moment . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take action right now ! &quot;
let &apos;s start with this picture .
it is a common housing estate .
however , it is not common for us .
why ?
because here is where I started my business .
in fact , from the start , I didn &apos;t plan to crave out at a housing estate .
however , as I asked around , all the industrial parks including Zhang@@ jiang Hi @-@ Tech Park were far more expensive than I could afford .
hence I had no alternative but to give up the first preference .
in that way , as college student entrepreneurs , we had to start the business in a humble residential district .
but we adapted to such an environment soon .
please look at this photo .
we lived and ate together , and regarded company as our home .
joy was over@@ flowing at that time .
we were dedicated to our career and discussed with great ambition .
in the winter , we can appreciate the snow @-@ covered views , or have a snow@@ ball fight .
just as in this photo , we were happy and am@@ icable like a real family .
so in the beginning , it was good .
we started with eight members .
actually , it was great .
however , as we gradually developed into a group of more than 20 people , troubles followed close on .
as we sometimes occupied the elevator , discontent spread among several neighbors .
what &apos;s worse , they insisted on complaining and even reporting to the administration for industry and commerce .
that was not the worst .
they also fabricated the rumor that , &quot; Something happened in our community ! a very serious problem ! hundreds of people engaged in illegal training here ! &quot;
Oh my goodness !
owing to this , officials in the department were highly eager to get into action since they hadn &apos;t met such a major case .
one day , the head of the department personally led a crowd of officials and rushed to our office .
at that time , I still had a meeting with my customer elsewhere .
afterwards , I heard from my colleagues that a group of people stormed in , who were all dressed in uniform and amounted to a dozen or so .
it is surprising that they came in without a single word , just looked around and took photos , and finally left quietly .
a huge puzzle for us .
after that , the department frequently contacted me , asking me to have a face @-@ to @-@ face talk with the head in the office .
the head asked me , &quot; Young man , what &apos;s your opinion on solving this ? &quot;
after pon@@ dering , since I had prepares for the worst , I replied that you could act accordingly .
surprisingly , he said : &quot; well , if I am not wrong , as I entered into your office , the first impression was that it was similar to America &apos;s Apple and Google who rose from gar@@ ages . listen to me , young minds think alike , I am on your side . &quot;
dramatically , right ?
the thrill was beyond description and I asked : &quot; do you mean no punishment then ? &quot;
he completely ignored my question and continued , &quot; B@@ eli@@ eve me , I have seen many enterprises , but few can be on a par with yours . the community will restrict your development and there must be many industrial parks which are eager to let you in . if you rent a new place and get ready to move , let me know and then it &apos;s settled , OK ? &quot;
thanks to unexpected good fortune that got me out of the trouble .
I remember that the head was thirty @-@ seven or -@@ eight years old at that time , and I was about ten years younger .
in fact , during the entrepreneurial process , such problems were quite common .
today , I will not go into details for lack of time .
another story .
once , salary day coincided with the blank account .
no money left at all .
I stopped an employee and asked him , &quot; Do you have 1,800 yuan ? &quot;
he happened to have the money and gave it to me .
however , I said , &quot; Please wait . &quot;
&quot; anything else ? &quot; he asked .
&quot; this is your salary this month . &quot; I said .
he was surprised but I was not .
although I knew that later payment of salary would not disappoint the staff , at the very beginning , I swore to myself that arrears of wages was never in my dictionary .
I myself could owe you money , but our company must not do in the same way .
thank you .
I remember it was my most difficult and embarrassing time in terms of money .
same things never happened since then .
however , despite great hardness , no one gave up .
instead , we were still a cheerful team and moved forwards to our dream , Internet education .
maybe a question is haun@@ ting in your minds .
at that time , you gathered those people and let them contributed their bits to a seemingly abstr@@ use and in@@ substantial goal , what had you done to deserve this ?
to be frank , at the beginning of my entrepreneurship , I was an ordinary college graduate , the most ordinary one .
here , this picture shows in 2005 , how I , a post @-@ graduate who just left college and decided to start a business , looked like .
a &quot; hairy &quot; young man indeed .
not &quot; hairy &quot; enough ?
then turn to this one .
thick hair , right ?
but look at me now , time has &quot; polished &quot; my top .
it &apos;s a natural thing since I always went to bed at 3 or 4 o &apos;clock in the morning after 14 hours of work time every day .
work was a routine no matter others relaxed or not .
starting a business deprived me of a normal life .
looking back , I don &apos;t want to start a business anymore .
true words sometimes .
at that time , thick hair was not my only &quot; advantage , &quot; but more importantly , I was full of vigour and enthusiasm .
I was fond of the Internet and firmly believed that it was the key to change everything , including future education in China .
to this end , I started Hu@@ jiang , an online learning platform at a very early time .
to be more specific , since my junior year in college in 2001 , Hu@@ jiang was founded and open to the public free of charge afterwards .
hence when I graduated and embarked on real career , I was not alone due to my partners .
he is my first partner , the C@@ TO of Hu@@ jiang .
I chose him as his skills were , well , a little better than mine .
he graduated from Sun Yat @-@ sen University in Guangdong province , maj@@ oring in Ge@@ op@@ hysics plus Accounting , which had nothing to do with the Internet technology .
however , one year before graduation , he adopted as@@ p technology to conduct a subject .
after that , his interest got out of hand , so did his belief in his own future success in this field .
later he did a part @-@ time job in Shanghai , and met me .
we fit in easily .
it reminds of an anec@@ dote .
at that time , we all called him &quot; general engineer . &quot;
others would associate it with &quot; chief engineer . &quot;
in fact , the true meaning was shared simply among our team members .
as we had a difficult start and for a long time , he was generally the only one programming engineer , or abbrevi@@ ated as &quot; general engineer . &quot;
now here is another picture .
it was the first gathering before starting our business , in which I invited all the people who helped me free of charge during those five years .
I said , &quot; I &apos;ve decided to start a formal company and now we can own the shares together . but all of you should first finish a task , that is , to borrow money separately ! &quot;
I had same task as well .
however , though I borrowed from all acquaintances , more money was necessary .
then back to Shanghai , I turned to an intimate classmate during college and asked him to borrow me 20,000 yuan .
he looked at me and answered , &quot; No . &quot;
I was down@@ hearted accordingly .
actually I had made full mental preparations in case of failure to borrow more money .
naturally , a new graduate from college may barely earn his living , let alone to save 20,000 yuan that was available to support your new business with an ambiguous future .
though I didn &apos;t hold much hope , I was then overcome by sorrow .
why ?
because I had no methods towards more money , neither v@@ c nor angel investors .
in other words , angel investors didn &apos;t know me either .
fortunately , as I was at a loss what to do and depressed at losing the last straw , he looked straight at me , and added several words : &quot; but my father has money ! &quot;
I didn &apos;t even know how he managed to persuade his father .
the funny thing afterwards was that he held the money tight and I wanted to take it , so the money moved back and forth between us for several times .
I said , &quot; What are you doing ? do you regret ? &quot;
he replied , &quot; No , no , no . the last question , OK ? can we give up now ? &quot;
&quot; ridiculous ! if I quit now , why do I borrow your money ? &quot;
he explained , &quot; OK , listen to me . you , Fu Cair@@ ui , is not the last among classmates . why not choose other careers ? is starting a business a must ? how can you make profit ? &quot;
then I said , &quot; M@@ m ... I don &apos;t know . &quot;
at that time , I didn &apos;t think too much of it as I had already made up my mind to start a business .
unexpectedly , I finally got the money .
therefore , we can conclude that we surely need partners and friends , especially when you are in trouble , or just start a business .
owing to the money , at last , 8 members were equipped with 8 swi@@ vel chairs and in the aforementioned housing estate , started with 80,000 yuan .
then how about others apart from the original 8 members ?
they were all boy@@ friends or girl@@ friends of these 8 ones , or their relatives .
there &apos;s a saying goes , &quot; If one person starts a business , the whole family will suffer . &quot;
look ！
luckily , we did better in the second year .
following photos were taken in the second , the third , the fourth , the fifth , the sixth , finally the six and a half years , now .
for a long time since our start , if I am to sum up , the greatest experience is that , if you want to go fast , go on your own .
because nobody will disagree with you and you can just follow your own heart .
but if you want to go far , go along with partners .
furthermore , if you want to go far and steady , multiply your partners .
sometimes I would like to compare starting a new business with the journey to the west .
Tang Mon@@ k had never imagined to go along with a monkey ( Sun Wu@@ kong ) and a pig ( Zhu Ba@@ jie ) , nor all sorts of monsters and astonishing experience .
but the process is still so fascinating and exciting that it makes you feel like you can change the world , or you have changed the world to what extent .
in conclusion , if entrepreneurship is a journey , destination is naturally important , but it is more crucial to set out with those like @-@ minded .
if we compare the career we pursue to a vast ocean , then the most crucial part is to set sail with those who share similar ideas .
to conclude , not only to myself , but also &quot; T@@ n@@ Dao &quot; and all the members , wish you all the best in 20@@ 13 , and go further .
my wife received a letter from a pupil two days ago , one who studies at a rural primary school .
in the letter , he told us that he already received the 180 Yuan scholarship that we donated .
although his academic performance is not very good , he has neat handwriting .
he also mentioned his grandmother , as well as other parts of his life .
when my wife showed me the letter , I felt touched and realized that our donation really helped someone else .
but my wife told me , &quot; The problem is I donated 1000 Yuan in total . maybe they made good use of the remaining 8@@ 20 Yuan , like distributing it to others in need . but I cannot figure out where did the money go . &quot;
ya &apos;an in Sichuan province suffered a 7.@@ 0 Rich@@ ter scale earthquake not long ago .
everyone &apos;s hearts went out to the victims , and they donated countless sums of money .
a very famous charity organization raised 2@@ 2,@@ 400,000 Yuan in total , which included donations from the company I work for , Microsoft .
a more prestigious charity organization , however , only raised 14@@ 3,000 Yuan .
how come there was such a huge difference ?
it is because of distrust .
what leads to in@@ ep@@ titude ?
and what &apos;s the reason for distrust ?
in my opinion , these are caused by a lack of transparency .
without transparency , there is no professionalism , and then there is no trust .
the prerequisite for professionalism and trust is transparency .
I have been thinking since 2007 if there is a way to directly donate to those in need , rather than to charity organizations ?
in the case of charity organizations , if there is no proper regulation or supervision , they might spend donated money on other purposes without informing those who made the donations , which is the root cause of all problems .
then how can we bypass charity organizations and donate our money to those in need ?
is there any website that can display all known charity programs and then collect donations from the masses ?
imag@@ ining that such websites do exist , let &apos;s put aside the rules and policies for now .
supposing that such websites would be similar to the e @-@ commerce platform Ta@@ obao , you would be able to find many charity programs just like you can browse Ta@@ obao for various commodities .
for example , we have two programs now .
one is for a rural primary school , where no girls attend .
research has shown that the reason why girls don &apos;t go to school is because there is no women &apos;s toilet in the school .
3000 Yuan is needed to build a women &apos;s toilet .
another program is for an impoverished student who was admitted to Peking University .
he has received an admission letter , but he is not able to afford his tuition .
although he can take a part @-@ time job , how will he pay his tuition for his freshman year ?
the cost of a college student for one year is 5000 Yuan .
so we put these two programs on the website .
which one will you donate to ?
you don &apos;t have to donate lots of money , like 500,000 Yuan .
suppose I have 5 Yuan , I may donate 4 Yuan to the primary school , and 1 for the college student .
you could also donate all 5 to the student ; it &apos;s your choice .
my choice may be to donate 4 Yuan to the rural school , then this program will receive 4 Yuan from me .
is that enough ?
no , it &apos;s not even close .
as a donor , you certainly have your own values and judgments , and maybe some of you share the same ideas as me .
like this , one person don@@ ates 7 Yuan , another don@@ ates 8 , and some donate 20 Yuan .
a computer programmer could create a progress bar , and then donation after donation , 3,000 Yuan are quickly raised .
actually , it &apos;s very meaningful to help others , and it really matters .
too many people in China need help .
but I feel it is more important to get more people engaged in readily helping others .
if 30 million out of 1.3 billion people in China are desperate for help , then I would like to persuade the majority to help those in need .
as for this 3,000 Yuan , either 1,500 people can each donate 2 Yuan , or one person can donate 3,000 . which do you prefer ?
I would prefer if 1,500 people could each donate 2 Yuan .
so when the &apos; progress bar &apos; gradually draws near to its end , perhaps hundreds of people have contributed to it , even if they each only gave a few coins .
typically we donate our money to a collections box , and that &apos;s it - we don &apos;t even know what happens to our donation .
but in the case of a website , the case has just begun when the 3,000 Yuan is raised .
with the raised money , the organization behind the website has to implement this particular charity case according to its original goal and plan , because it needs to make regular progress updates .
it &apos;s as though they first purchase all the construction materials , and next they contact a construction team .
this team gradually builds a wall , a ceiling , and then finishes painting .
pictures are then posted one after another , and emails and texts are sent to donors saying that the toilet is under construction .
and one day , it &apos;s finally completed .
and it seems like the 2 Yuan you donated was really worth 4 , and you are treated like a customer on Ta@@ obao .
the charity website keeps asking you for a good review .
why ?
in the end , every donor will review the program .
how much your comment matters corresponds to your donation .
if I contribute 4 Yuan to the 3,000 , then I have four three @-@ thous@@ and@@ ths of the reviewing rights , accordingly .
if the best review possible is 5 stars , then I might offer 3 stars , or perhaps even 5 stars .
why 3 or 5 stars ? I don &apos;t know , but I just feel happy to do so .
the transparency of the whole process leaves me with the impression that charity websites are professional and care about how I feel .
maybe that &apos;s why I give them 5 stars .
and if so , the charity organization will be inclined to think that in order to get a higher score , they must consider at every step how their donors feel .
what the donors care the most about is either professionalism or efficiency , or ultimately how those in need benefit from the charity program .
but why do they pay so much attention to your reviews ?
this is because the charity organization will begin with your nice review and gain an increasingly better reputation .
their reputation might initially be rated as a single star , then as a diamond , and then finally as a golden crown .
other organizations may not have such a good reputation .
for example , they may have only three or four stars .
so the next time you intend to donate or others contribute to a new program , you will all first check the charity organization &apos;s rating .
no charity organization can survive without a budget , so they need a certain cut from the money collected to serve as management fees and salaries for their employees .
now imagine this , a two @-@ crown charity organization charges an 8 % management fee while a three @-@ star organization only charges 5 % .
so which one do you choose : the one with the two @-@ crown rating and an 8 % management fee , or the other with the three @-@ star rating and a 5 % management fee ?
we all have different values and judgments ; some will choose the former despite its high charges , because it has a good reputation , so they trust it and believe that their donation will make a difference through this organization .
although the latter only charges 5 % , donors may suspect that the remaining 95 % cannot truly be helpful in its hands .
I would also prefer to make contributions to the former who charges 8 % .
what &apos;s the meaning of this ?
this is so that the charity organizations with high ratings can grow .
the more transparent and efficient they are , the more massive and trustworthy they become .
suppose you donate 20 Yuan monthly , no matter to what cause .
now with their development , every detail of your contribution can be tracked .
so will you still drop your coins into a collections box only to have no idea what happens next ?
looking back , we can see that a famous charity organization once only raised 14@@ 3,000 Yuan .
one day when this website is collecting more money due to its transparency , that particular charity organization may have a moment of intro@@ spec@@ tion , asking themselves , &apos; What should we do ? should we be transparent ? &apos;
or should we just raise money on this website ? &apos;
I hope that in the future a platform like this website can put all charity organizations on the right track , soothing donors whose hearts have been broken before .
the boss of the boss of the boss of my boss is Bill Gates , and he has a friend called Warren Buffett .
bill Gates is very outstanding in his industry , and we have every reason to say that he is one of the richest men in the world .
meanwhile , Warren Buffett is a pillar of the financial arena , one of the most successful men in finance .
one is from industry , and the other is from finance .
industry is about creation while finance al@@ locates resources to those who create , distributing quality resources to those engaged in entrepreneurship .
they have intriguing ways of supporting charities .
as for Bill Gates , he set up the Gates Foundation , which concentrates on global issues , like the prevention and treatment of HIV , poverty in third world countries , etc .
in addition , he travels all over the world to handle the welfare problems encountered by the Foundation .
what Warren Buffett has done is also interesting , as he said , &quot; How I contribute to charity is to donate dozens of billions of dollars to Bill Gates . &quot;
because he thinks Bill Gates can probably do better than him .
he just sticks to a proven belief : allocate quality resources to a visionary entrepreneur .
as introduced by the host , I love travelling , and I have been to both the G@@ ob@@ i Desert and Antarctica .
this July I &apos;m going to the North Pole .
this time I expect to do something unusual at the North Pole .
that is , I would like to bring back from the North Pole some ice that has been frozen for thousands of years .
with the ice that I bring back , I will make some neck@@ lac@@ es in the shape of water droplets , and I will give them to volunteers who have contributed greatly to charity .
I wish you all help to bring transparency to this lofty cause in China .
there are so many donations in the world , and it &apos;s my wish that all of them can be spent transp@@ arently and responsibly on the purposes that they were meant for .
the power of professionalism and trust lies in transparency .
thank you all !
first of all , I &apos;d like to extend my gratitude to the event organizer for putting me at the first place today to come clean about my d@@ are@@ devil experience .
at the very beginning , I &apos;d like to introduce the accompl@@ ices of my band of d@@ are@@ devil to you .
there are men , women , teenagers , and even people infected by virus in the band .
and some of them are not human beings at all .
the d@@ are@@ dev@@ ils are very adventurous as well as aggressive in some cases .
however , they are always persistent to fight for their dreams .
so what I want to share with you today is how to become a d@@ are@@ devil in the O@@ 2@@ O industry .
let me brief you what is O@@ 2@@ O first .
O@@ 2@@ O refers to the offline @-@ to @-@ online sale of services .
O@@ 2@@ O sells services , which is different from B@@ 2@@ C that sells products .
you can buy a real product by logging in on shopping websites like J@@ D@@ .com or Ta@@ obao at home , and then receive what you buy at your door@@ step .
but O@@ 2@@ O is trying to sell a certain service on the Internet .
for example , when we place an order for a meal or a haircut online , it would be very complicated to complete a closed @-@ loop consumption procedure , that is to say we have to go offline for the rest of the order however we make the deal online .
so there exist huge difficulties when we are embar@@ king on O@@ 2@@ O .
why do we have to do O@@ 2@@ O like a d@@ are@@ devil and how difficult it is ?
here are my answers .
the fore@@ runner of O@@ 2@@ O industry is the group @-@ buying websites .
as we all know that one of the most popular internet sens@@ ations two or three years ago was group @-@ buying .
thousands of group @-@ buying service providers could pop up online overnight .
then everyone was sn@@ apping up the low @-@ cost services and food online .
here is a very typical example , in Shanghai , many people would flock to Da Tong Da for foot massage .
the regular foot massage service in Da Tong Da cost more than 100 RMB per person , but the price would be cut down to tens of or less than twenty RMB if you purchased the service via group @-@ buying .
however , after the period of frantic competitions among such websites , what we often hear about today is the shutdown of group @-@ buying websites , don &apos;t we ?
I guess there are few of group @-@ buying websites now .
so these are the pioneers of O@@ 2@@ O .
then who are the follow @-@ up successors of O@@ 2@@ O ?
they just vanished before they got closer to the edge of the industry .
I &apos;d like to give your some examples .
I describe a phenomenon to you without giving out the brand name .
we used to find out many teenage boys and girls gathering around a machine at metro station to get a kind of coupons for offline shopping .
but this could only be seen about two years ago .
now let &apos;s think about it very carefully .
can you see any teenagers gathering around a machine at a metro station now ?
let &apos;s go back to O@@ 2@@ O .
piles of O@@ 2@@ O companies keep spr@@ inging up .
there is still no one out of these companies succeeding in figuring out the closed @-@ loop consumption pattern of O@@ 2@@ O , that consumers could adapt to in an easier manner .
from this perspective , O@@ 2@@ O industry is destined to die .
but we cannot simply give it up for its doomed destiny .
here is a very simple example .
I watched all videos about Jack Ma .
he proposed ten years ago to put clothes and shoes from offline sales to online sales .
many people at that time didn &apos;t buy it , questioning that people had to try the clothes and shoes on to see if they fit or match with the pants .
so Jack Ma &apos;s idea encountered many obstacles .
now , ten years later , when you take a look at the B@@ 2@@ C industry , you can barely find anyone who doesn &apos;t buy clothes , shoes , and even home appliances online .
so the Internet does bring impact and transformation to the offline consumption pattern .
next I &apos;d like to answer a question that if O@@ 2@@ O is destined to die , is it too early to pro@@ pel it now ?
what if the industry just per@@ ishes abruptly ?
where did this argument come from ?
here is the thing , do you know what is the first batch of listed internet enterprises ?
yes , the first batch is portal website , such as Yahoo .
by the end of 1990s or the early 200@@ 0s , we began to find out that many portal websites were listed .
then what is the second batch of listed internet companies ?
they are game developers represented by Sh@@ anda Group .
later on we find out many function @-@ based internet enterprises come into the market .
what we &apos;ve heard most these couple of years is that the trans@@ acti@@ onal B@@ 2@@ C companies are listed .
we notice that we post @-@ 8@@ 0s generation needs at least ten years to develop a new industry and accumulate the knowledge , as a saying goes that it takes ten years to forge a good sword .
so when we find ourselves know a little about the internet , we must choose a business inside the sector and carry on doing it , that business seems to be O@@ 2@@ O .
next I &apos;d like to talk about the internet industry environment , that &apos;s the reason why I hold on to O@@ 2@@ O .
in the internet industry , your entrepreneurial plans will always be over@@ shadowed by those from the three internet giants , Baidu , Ali@@ baba and T@@ enc@@ ent .
although Baidu CEO Robin Li Yan@@ hong said at this year &apos;s IT Summit that the three giants are not rocks lying ahead of young entrepreneurs , in my opinion , they hinder many of start @-@ ups .
here is a simple example .
Baidu is a prominent money sp@@ inner , and it &apos;s capable of acquiring many enterprises in different sectors in one night .
then I would say I can start up my business in another sector .
what else can you do ?
let &apos;s try online transaction .
however you &apos;ll find it &apos;s very difficult to beat Ali@@ baba no matter how hard you try in online transaction .
all your payments have to go through Ali@@ pay .
you are surrounded by Ali@@ baba &apos;s products .
plus Ali@@ baba is a strong acqui@@ rer too .
here comes T@@ enc@@ ent .
I bet that whatever you make , you will lose your market the next day after T@@ enc@@ ent embar@@ ks on developing the same stuff against yours .
in conclusion , start up your own business is extremely tough .
however these three internet giants will turn a deaf ear to O@@ 2@@ O before people figure it out .
so they all choose to stay put instead of making a tiny step forward .
so I think a new opportunity is forthcoming , and O@@ 2@@ O is the most workable option among all .
but the process of doing O@@ 2@@ O is very , very tor@@ turing .
first of all , we must meet a large amount of clients everyday .
for instance , the sector of daily life services includes e@@ ater@@ ies , hair@@ dressing , beauty and sp@@ a , educational training , mother @-@ and @-@ baby care as well as wedding planning .
but why do I say it &apos;s difficult ?
in B@@ 2@@ C industry , I can produce a computer following strict standards .
the production of a computer involves nothing else but the CPU , the hard drive capacity and the screen size .
but in O@@ 2@@ O industry , when you are opening a restaurant , take hot pot as an example , you will find categories like Chongqing hot pot , Beijing hot pot and Taiwan mini hot pot , won &apos;t you ?
for Chongqing hot pot , the restaurant owner could be a Sichuan native , a Sichuan non @-@ local , and even those who are from investment circle .
and then you can tell the varying levels of restaurant owners just from the service attitude and quality of restaurant wait@@ ers .
every one knows about the stories of Ha@@ id@@ il@@ ao hot pot , right ?
and you might also know how other hot pot restaurant owners run their businesses .
so the standardization level of Sichuan hot pot is far from satisfaction .
in that respect , it &apos;s quite difficult to do O@@ 2@@ O as we may come across various clients .
I myself have led two O@@ 2@@ O teams from Beijing to Shanghai .
why do I put forward the concept of d@@ are@@ devil ?
many young people nowadays have many job options ; venture capital and head@@ hunting industries are picking up momentum .
young people get used to job @-@ hopping driven by benefits .
I often talk to my teams , saying if you &apos;ve stuck to the jobs in one industry for ten years , you will become a top expert in it .
in this regard , I &apos;d like to encourage all young people , if you are working in O@@ 2@@ O industry , stick with it just like a d@@ are@@ devil .
I firmly believe O@@ 2@@ O will create a chance for young people and will bring about bigger market impact .
thank you .
good afternoon , everyone !
it &apos;s a special day of May 4 , and I &apos;d like to share with you something special in this special T@@ n@@ Dao Talk in Beijing .
I hope you and many other who love Chinese culture find my talk worthy and thoughtful .
it &apos;s about Chinese characters , and the comparison between Chinese characters and the alphabe@@ tic writing .
we are all familiar with Chinese characters and the alphabe@@ tic writing .
they aroused a century @-@ old academic debate among scholars and thinkers in modern China .
and it &apos;s about whether we should discard Chinese characters and replace them with the alphabe@@ tic writing .
there are 3,000 or so languages globally , all being alphabe@@ tic based on letters , with Chinese characters as the only exception .
of the Chinese culture circle , North Korea abandoned Chinese characters ; Japan and South Korea only kept a few in use ; the Vietnam who has been using Chinese characters for 2,000 years turned to alphabe@@ tic writing in 1945 .
western academics hold that primitive writing evolved to ide@@ o @-@ phon@@ ographic writing and finally to alphabe@@ tic writing , the utmost stage of its development .
according to this theory , Chinese characters as ide@@ o @-@ phon@@ ographic writing in the lower stage of development should be discarded and will be replaced by Latin alphabet .
against this backdrop , the ferocious contention about Chinese characters and Latin alphabet took place three times over the past century , i.e. the May 4th Movement , early years of the new China , as well as the post @-@ Cultural Revolution Movement .
during the May 4th period , Lu Xun and other advoc@@ ators of the New Culture Movement saw Chinese characters as the root of cultural backwardness , and strongly supported the idea of abol@@ ishing Chinese characters .
they were so determined and declared &quot; If we don &apos;t abolish Chinese characters , the whole country will decline and perish . &quot;
however , there are many people who stood on the other side , and oppose to shake or abolish the foundation of the Chinese nation .
some scholars pointed out that the movement to abolish Chinese characters or replace them with Latin alphabet led by the theory of backward Chinese characters in the last 100 years was unprecedented in its duration , scale , and impact in the Chinese cultural history .
unfortunately , Chinese characters are extraordinarily complex , and this grand debate didn &apos;t find the answer because there is no answer .
in 2009 , Confucius Institute made a large documentary titled The 5,000 @-@ Year Chinese Charac@@ ters , showing the whole world how splendid and grand the language is .
but when asked about the future of Chinese characters , they were hes@@ itative and responded : &quot; we don &apos;t know . &quot;
because there is no such thing as an answer .
teachers after teachers lecture our children in learning Chinese language , but none of them could tell them what really is the language ; is it really inferior or backward or outdated .
Chinese language is the carrier of the Chinese civilization ; thus its future development is and will be essential to our nation .
as for the essence of the Chinese language , we will seek for the answer soon or later .
I am a psychologist .
three years ago , my fellows and I discovered an amazing brain wave in our research .
this brain wave helped us to uncover the mystery of Chinese characters by accident .
my research priority is cognitive neuro@@ science , the frontier research of psychology , which is exploring the brain mechanism for brain and mental activities via technological means .
our nerve cells in the brain continuously discharge when we are reading newspaper , listening to lectures or pon@@ dering problems .
these electric signals finally reach our scalp and can be recorded through some specialized equipment ; this is what brain waves are .
in 2008 We found for the first time a negative @-@ going brain wave appeared on top and central of the brain in about 200 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds or 1 / 5 second when Chinese people are reading Chinese characters , and we called it &quot; The top and central area N@@ 200 . &quot;
with three years of repeated experiments , we finally confirmed the phenomenon .
the discovery of N@@ 200 shows that Chinese characters are not hier@@ og@@ l@@ yp@@ hic , as picture symbols would never cause the appearance of N@@ 200 brain wave , which means Chinese characters and picture symbols are different things .
what continued to surprise us when we consulted plenty of literature and data was that such brain waves never appeared in English words reading .
when reading English words , at the same span of 200 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ ond , we couldn &apos;t find N@@ 200 .
astonished , we concluded that this brain wave is specific to readers of Chinese characters ; it stems from years of learning and using this language .
moreover , the N@@ 200 has nothing to do with our oral language . it only belongs to our Chinese characters in writing , so there &apos;s no N@@ 200 when we &apos;re listening to Chinese .
the discovery of N@@ 200 is a major breakthrough in Chinese reading mechanism in the past 30 years , and it demonstrates that Chinese characters and the alphabe@@ tic writing go through different process in the human brain .
but why is it exclusive to Chinese characters ?
this brain wave has been proved to be closely related with the recognition of shapes and forms of Chinese characters .
hence the N@@ 200 prompted me to dig into the essence of Chinese characters , and with efforts I finally put forward a new &quot; theory of meaning @-@ based Chinese characters , &quot; declaring its meaning basis for the first time .
to understand the meaning @-@ based writing , one has to know about the phon@@ etic writing .
in phon@@ etic writing , bigger phon@@ etic components are formed by smaller ones spelled together .
and the principle behind is actually similar to that of musical no@@ tations .
it seems that we use our eyes to read alpha@@ bets or musical no@@ tations , but if we want to understand musical no@@ tations or alpha@@ bets , we have to turn to the sounds they symbolize .
therefore , be it alphabe@@ tic or phon@@ etic writing , they are created to record sounds and they are sensitive to the ears .
in this sense , they fall into the category of hearing @-@ based writing .
however , Chinese characters are meaning @-@ based writing , a completely different category for their structure .
Chinese people invented about 10,000 individual characters from the time of or@@ acle bone inscri@@ ptions to the Eastern Han Dynasty .
each charac@@ ther represents a different meaning .
our ancest@@ ers even invented different characters to represent horses in different colors .
it &apos;s to our knowledge that new things and concepts emerge in endlessly everyday with the advancement of civilization and the progress of society .
if we just create new characters for new concepts , we would gradually have 10,000 , 20,000 , 30,000 , 40,000 or more characters , and it would be a burden for us to remember them all .
because the massive quantity is way beyond people &apos;s memory capacity , and this kind of writing system would collapse eventually .
and just in time our great ancestors found the important principle of meaning @-@ based writing , where they put a horse and a vehicle together and invented a new character den@@ ot@@ ating a carriage .
new meaning @-@ based units come from basic meaning units , the opposite to ph@@ one@@ tics .
with meaning @-@ based writing we don &apos;t have to create new characters for new things .
it reli@@ eves us the burden for remembering tons of new characters , and creates limit@@ less possibility for the development of Chinese l@@ exic@@ ography .
and most importantly , it turns Chinese characters into a mature and complete writing system .
our ancestors knew to form words by combining existing characters .
today we all know it .
but what our ancest@@ ers and us did not know is that the process of forming new words from characters is actually works in line with a fundamental prin@@ ce@@ ple in psychology and brain science , which is called the principle of conceptual network .
it means humans &apos; representation of the world is in the form of conceptual network .
here we have nine Chinese characters , meaning beef , pork , mutton , rabbit meat , pig , cattle , sheep , rabbit and meat respectively .
even if you don &apos;t understand Chinese characters , you could tell from the word forms that they are somehow connected in a network .
and this network could help us understand the meaning of each word and the formation behind them .
but if you just translate these words into English , you couldn &apos;t find any connection among their English con@@ ter@@ parts .
you see , our ancestors didn &apos;t know the meaning @-@ based principle , but they just applied it when forming words un@@ knowingly .
until today we finally find and understand the profound scientific basis of Chinese characters in the field of psychology and brain science .
for meaning @-@ based writing to express and demonstrate the diversified world , it has to have 6,000 to 7,000 basic signals as its minimal and basic meaning units .
due to the limit of human hearing capacity , we have to rely on our vision for meaning @-@ based writing .
vision is superior to hearing in terms of information proc@@ essi@@ ong .
in this point , meaning @-@ based writing has to be vision @-@ based .
the recognition of Chinese characters definitely involves complicated and profound visual processing .
by now we finally figure out why N@@ 200 , which reflects visual processing in our brain , only appears in when we read Chinese characters .
it &apos;s because Chinese characters are indeed vision @-@ based .
Chinese characters and alpha@@ bets are two different kinds of writing : one is vision @-@ dependent , and the other hearing @-@ based .
they are not inter@@ changeable , therefore , it &apos;s impossible to replace Chinese characters with Latin alpha@@ bets .
with the precise scientific demonstration of the meaning @-@ basis principle , it neg@@ ates the possibility of replacing Chinese characters with Latin alpha@@ bets , finally a solution to the century @-@ old contention .
besides , the meaning @-@ basis principle was accompanied with many interesting new ideas and conclusions .
and I &apos;d like to say something in this regard .
first , languages are the foundation and means of human thinking .
the vision @-@ based Chinese characters and the hearing @-@ based Western alpha@@ bets rely on different senses .
therefore , it is of immense significance to our way of thinking .
that &apos;s why people say Chinese are good at imag@@ inal or visu@@ alized thinking , while wester@@ ns abstract and logic thinking .
it all bo@@ ils down to the fundamental difference between the two languages .
second , Vision and hearing are two most important senses for human .
meaning @-@ based writing relies more on vision , and the phon@@ etic writing relies more on hearing .
they are the only two types of writing systems and they represent the utmost stage of language development .
with this , there &apos;s no point in saying which one is superior as both Chinese characters and alphabe@@ tics have their advantages and disadvantages .
we could say that the principle of meaning @-@ basis helped Chinese characters to stand with the alphabe@@ tic writing on an equal footing for the very first time .
and now every Chinese who uses this language is justified to feel proud ; every professor who lectures in Chinese is proud to say to his students &quot; You &apos;re learning the greatest language in the world . &quot;
in today &apos;s glob@@ alized world , we are learning foreign languages , and foreigners are learning Chinese .
the meaning @-@ basis principle separates Chinese and English to two different language systems , therefore , those who teach Foreign languages or Chinese could better grasp the fundamental characteristics of the two languages , laying the foundation for science @-@ based and systemic teaching methods .
the paper of N@@ 200 and the principle of meaning @-@ basis was published in China &apos;s top journals in Natural Science and Social Science , and received extensive attention .
indeed , it &apos;s acad@@ em@@ ically @-@ valued , but it shows profound relevance in China today as well , and that &apos;s the reason why I want to share something with you here in T@@ n@@ Dao .
how about going back into history ?
the ancient Europeans all spoke one common language called primitive Ger@@ manic .
as time went by , the language gradually broke down to various dial@@ ects , namely the present @-@ day English , German , French and Italy .
when we use alpha@@ bets to record different dial@@ ects , the final words formed would vary with different pron@@ unci@@ ations or sp@@ ell@@ ings .
and this is why even today European countries still couldn &apos;t understand better each other in either speaking or writing .
but the Chinese language is not the case .
different dial@@ ects with special pron@@ unci@@ ations in this country all use the common Chin@@ se characters for representation .
so we could communicate in the common writing language despite that we may not understand each other in different acc@@ ents or dial@@ ects .
and the common national culture is formed .
if we replaced Chinese characters with alpha@@ bets , we would probably be broken into parts like today &apos;s Europe and never be as one great united country as we do now .
Chinese characters made essential contributions to national unification and ethnic unity , and formed the glorious Chinese civilization .
it would just do them justice by acknowledging their importance as a symbol for Chinese culture .
there &apos;re three more things regarded as symbols for Chinese culture , and they are : the centr@@ alism , Confucianism and the imperial examination system as well as the modern college entrance examination .
to our knowledge , the four symbols or pillars for Chinese culture all have been challenged .
the centr@@ alism was challenged by the parliamentary system and universal suffrage ; Confucianism challenged by universal values and morals ; the college entrance examination challenged by Western education philosophy of individuality ; and Chinese characters by alpha@@ bets .
indeed , in the historic context of Sino @-@ western civilization collision , Chinese language was deemed as inferior and almost abandoned , an inevitable outcome for the declined Chinese culture since the defeat in the O@@ pi@@ um War .
and the Chinese started to intro@@ spect and strive to learn from the West open @-@ min@@ de@@ dly , admiring the advanced military power as well as the political system , technology , education of the West , and finally fell for the Western civilization completely and blindly .
over the past century we found ourselves inferior in any contention or comparison , and we even wanted to abandon our language .
because we suffered severely in our confidence and pride , and we nearly lost the courage to make creations .
admittedly , if a man only looks up to other people &apos;s standards , seeing himself as a follow@@ er , a l@@ ag@@ g@@ ard , then how could he be courageous and bold enough to create .
once you feel un@@ confident , you lose the courage to create , and lose the ability to create , finally leading to no confidence at all .
this cruel vicious cycle dis@@ hear@@ tens and daun@@ ts many people in creating the future as it makes us feel un@@ confident in our culture .
however , the biggest competition among countries in the 21st century is all about culture , thus we have to re @-@ build our culture if we want to win the competition , without ever repeating the defeat in the O@@ pi@@ um War .
but to rebuild we need true confidence and pride , which born out of our confirmation and recognition of traditional Chinese culture anew .
or , we have to re @-@ recognize Chinese core values supported by the above @-@ mentioned four pillars for the purpose of national rejuven@@ ation and revival of Chinese culture in the new era .
and today I ask you to look at Chinese characters .
we have demonstrated through research the scientific foundation and the unique development for Chinese characters .
hence , even if the whole world is using the same alpha@@ bets , we are not giving up our language .
it &apos;s the crystallization of the Chinese civilization , representing the core value of the whole nation , thus we can &apos;t replace it with Latin alpha@@ bets or have it wester@@ n@@ ized .
Chinese characters offer us a powerful example to show that China walks a different path from other countries , western ones included .
and we &apos;re power@@ fully supported to be equal to the West .
the restore of confidence is necessary to and symbolic of the rejuven@@ ation of Chinese nation .
the 170 years since the O@@ pi@@ um War , a quarter in the 5,000 @-@ year civilization , is a mere moment in history .
the mountains are still there , but the sun@@ sets have changed .
let us grow confident in our great Chinese characters , transcend temporary victory or defeat , and write a grand new chapter for the rejuven@@ ation of the Chinese nation with our traditional diligence , wisdom and courage .
I believe that as the new generation in the 21st century , we are aspir@@ ant enough to dream , to pursue , and to live up to our ancestors .
thank you very much !
Mr. Kai Fu Lee has a Wei@@ bo post called &quot; Eight Su@@ gg@@ estions for Family Education , &quot; which has been forwarded more than 3@@ 8,000 times .
not just this single Wei@@ bo post , Lee &apos;s relaxed and tolerant educational concept has been widely accepted by the public .
now , on this occasion , I want to tell you that a relaxed and tolerant education concept is very useful to half of the children ; however if all parents agree with it , the other half of the children might get hurt .
why ?
let me start with two children with different personalities .
I &apos;m called Pa@@ op@@ ao &apos;s Dad , as my daughter is called Pa@@ op@@ ao .
Pa@@ op@@ ao behaves a bit like &quot; Monkey King . &quot;
she has an active mind , loves playing , and prefers to learn knowledge that she is interested with in a vivid way .
I have adapted Chinese history , Chinese geography , Chinese poems , various ency@@ clo@@ pe@@ dic knowledge , and even Haw@@ king &apos;s &quot; A Brief History of Time , &quot; into stories that can be told in a narrative and casual way , so as to arouse her learning interest .
this kind of parent @-@ child reading has made us happy for the most of the time .
but sometimes not .
kids , like Pa@@ op@@ ao , have some outstanding merits , as they have an open , thoughtful and creative mind , but they also have obvious shortcomings , as they are impatient and hate obe@@ ying rules .
take painting for an example .
Pa@@ op@@ ao &apos;s paintings often present vividly lif@@ eli@@ ke images , and many of my book illustrations are drawn by her .
but her art teacher says Pa@@ op@@ ao is short @-@ tempered and not careful enough .
but if you ask her to re@@ draw a picture , she would throw away her pen and get angry , shouting &quot; It &apos;s so annoying ! I don &apos;t wanna paint ! why should I paint ? it would be good if I didn &apos;t know how to paint ! &quot;
it &apos;s hard to get rid of her bad habits and change her personality .
other children can easily follow the rules , but she can &apos;t .
and every time I talk to her about this , she would respond with a very bad attitude , which has really driven me nuts .
Pa@@ op@@ ao &apos;s mom feels even worse than me , as she is a serious , rule @-@ abiding and very organized person .
she has a dream daughter in her mind , called Ta@@ ot@@ ao .
Ta@@ ot@@ ao is disciplined and obedient .
she always takes all tasks assigned by parents , and study earnestly and make practical progress .
however one day , Ta@@ ot@@ ao &apos;s mom said to Pa@@ op@@ ao &apos;s mom , &quot; Ta@@ ot@@ ao is studying very hard , but she is nervous and always afraid to fail the test . although she takes all work that you have given to her , she doesn &apos;t develop any hobbies . she doesn &apos;t have a creative mind and cares too much about what others think about her . Pa@@ op@@ ao is a good girl . she loves reading , painting and has so many novel ideas . it &apos;s so happy to see she is living in a comfortable and relaxed way . &quot;
at this time , I seemed to hear the &quot; crash &quot; of the dream for Pa@@ op@@ ao &apos;s mom .
the difference between these two children has triggered my thinking .
first , why are these two children so different ?
is it caused by acquired education ?
it seems not .
secondly , to teach students in accordance with their ap@@ titude , are there any rules to follow ?
at this time , a theory called &quot; Whole Brain Model &quot; helped me .
by the way , I once ran a public relations company for nine years , and I have used &quot; Whole Brain Model &quot; in my work .
it is about business management and has nothing to do with education .
however , Dr. N@@ ed Her@@ r@@ mann , the founder of the theory , did something very meaningful and instructive .
through a lot of statistical research , Her@@ r@@ mann told us that human brains have different thinking preferences , which means that each of us has different talents , disposition , advantages and disadvantages due to the influence of thinking preferences .
simply put , look at this picture .
some people are better at analytic logic ; some do better job in discipline enforcement ; some are tending to express and represent ; and others show strengths in imagination and creation .
thanks to Dr. Her@@ r@@ mann .
when I observe my child from the perspective of thinking preferences , I was suddenly enlightened .
I am lucky because there are a lot of kids around me that I can observe .
Pa@@ op@@ ao has a lot of friends , and I &apos;m very popular among her friends .
there is one thing that I often show off to others .
one day I stood at the entrance of our residential community .
a group of children saw me and rushed to embrace me , shouting loudly &quot; Pa@@ op@@ ao &apos;s dad , &quot; as they all like me very much .
Pa@@ op@@ ao ran slowly and couldn &apos;t squeeze in , and she just stood there and shouted , &quot; That &apos;s my dad ! &quot;
OK , let &apos;s continue to talk about the thinking preferences .
as my research and observation of thinking preferences deep@@ ens , I find that a Chinese did such study hundreds of years ago .
that is Wu Cheng@@ en .
why is Mon@@ k Tang San@@ z@@ ang so firm and strong ?
because he belongs to the left upper part , the analytical thinking type .
such people have an active mind , a strong learning ability , and are willing to compete against others .
Newton also belongs to this type .
most of scientists and theor@@ ists are in this category , including those around you who love playing cards , arguing , and reasoning .
monk Sha is obedient for he belongs to the left lower part , the sequential thinking type .
this kind of people are serious and practical with their work , pay attention to de@@ ti@@ als , and have executive ability .
Confucius and Zhou En@@ lai belong to this type .
those who love to do things by themselves or like photography , those who must finish housework without break , and those who must watch the very end of the TV series once they start with the first episode no matter it &apos;s good or not , all belong to the B part .
monk Pi@@ g belongs to the left lower part , the interpersonal thinking type .
besides , Princess Diana , most of the performers , those with rich emotions and those who love gossip are all in this category .
people of such kind hate math and logic formulas .
they are direction idi@@ ots .
and they don &apos;t like playing cards , and have no competitive mind .
you will never find a C @-@ type guy who loves playing cards .
they also have the tendency of backing up &quot; relatives &quot; rather than standing by the truth .
once they recognize you as their bosom friend , they will stand by your side unconditionally .
people in the A category fail to do so , as they always tend to be on the truth side .
if you complain to someone like Mon@@ k Tang San@@ z@@ ang and Newton , they seemingly show sympathy to you , but they might think no one is hated for nothing , there must have been a reason .
monkey King , Li Bai , Steve Jobs and late Chairman Mao Zedong all belong to the right upper part , the imaginative thinking type .
the guys around you who have tons of strange ideas and thoughts are also of this type .
people of B type hate them most , as they often challenge the rules of the B type .
but people of B type love them most , as they have unlimited vitality and creativity which are most needed by B type groups .
why is Jour@@ ney to the West an enduring classic work ?
because it depicts four representative types of people , and everyone can find themselves in it .
speaking of this , almost three quarters of the spectators can identify which type they belong to .
now is there anyone not sure about his answer ?
could you please raise your hand ?
OK , thank you .
I can honestly say that the vast majority of you who just raised your hand are C type , the same as Mon@@ k Pi@@ g .
why ?
you are not good at logical analysis .
just because you are not adept at this kind of thing , you have a series of merits .
for instance , you are warm , caring and full of compassion .
how to identify the thinking preference more accurately ?
I gave out detailed instructions in my new parent @-@ child education book .
writing this book has enabled me to know a lot of things .
parents have a preference for thinking , and so are the kids .
there is an old saying in China , &quot; One can be seen how his adulthood could be when he is still 7 years old , &quot; which is profound and thought @-@ provoking .
it is based on the recognition of endowment difference .
according to psychological theories , the age range from 7 to 12 years is the most important stage for a child to release nature and build confidence .
when a Mon@@ k Tang San@@ z@@ ang @-@ style parent meets with a Mon@@ k Pi@@ g @-@ style child , he must assume that the child is lack of competitive spirit and ambition , and is not brave enough .
likewise , if a Mon@@ k Pi@@ g @-@ style parent has a Mon@@ k Tang San@@ z@@ ang @-@ style child , he must feel his child is aggressive , stubborn and in@@ sensible .
parents would think for the most of the time that they should help their kids to overcome their weak points and correct all of their errors , and make up everything that they lack .
however , overcoming weak points and correcting errors are just the biggest problem in Chinese education , because when a child &apos;s weak points are overcome , his strengths will not be given full play .
such kind of education mode can only bring up ordinary people who are often lack of confidence .
monkey King can never behave properly as S@@ and Mon@@ k , no matter how many times the details and regulations are emphasized , while Mon@@ k Pi@@ g can never be as firm and determined as Mon@@ k Tang San@@ z@@ ang no matter how hard he has tried .
monkey King and Mon@@ k Pi@@ g have their own strengths .
as long as the advantages and strengths are given full play , everyone can find their own goal and direction of life .
many adults haven &apos;t found inner peace or haven &apos;t achieved success as anticipated , and they believed that the problem mainly lies in the fact that they haven &apos;t got rid of their shortcomings .
in fact , those who are more successful than us have more obvious weaknesses and shortcomings .
our problem is that we are so eager to cover up our own weaknesses and shortcomings that our strong points and advantages are suppressed to some extent .
the root cause for this kind of thinking is &quot; overcoming @-@ weak @-@ point &quot; style education .
for a child , most of his shortcomings and weaknesses are caused by thinking preferences .
that is not his fault , but his barrier .
that barrier not only affects others but also impe@@ des himself .
God treats everybody equally .
shortcomings and weaknesses always come along with strengths and talent .
find out your strengths and take efforts to cultivate your talent so as to maximize the value of life .
from the perspective of communication , if your child is of Monkey King style , you should adopt a loose education mode , giving him enough space to imagine and create at will .
if your child is of Mon@@ k Pi@@ g style , you must also be tolerant of him , and don &apos;t force him to do something that he is not willing to do .
as he cares about others &apos; feelings , he will be deeply hurt if he doesn &apos;t feel loved .
too much pressure will knock him down , so he will usually make up a story to get himself out of dilemma .
however , the loose and tolerant education mode is not suitable for all children .
people of Mon@@ k Tang San@@ z@@ ang style must set goals .
as only with goals , they can have the motivation to move forward .
and only with the achievements , they can be pleased .
otherwise , they will consider themselves a complete failure in life .
people like S@@ and Mon@@ k are sensitive to disciplines and norms by nature .
you must set rules or foster beliefs for a child like S@@ and Mon@@ k , or else he will feel at a loss .
more importantly , as parents you must set a good example for your kid , or else he will look down upon you .
from the perspective of cultivation , we should develop kids &quot; interests in accordance with their different talents , as a result of which their confidence and strengths will be further enhanced .
would you like to know whether your college major was a right choice ?
thinking preferences can give you the answer !
in a nut@@ shell , people of Mon@@ k Tang San@@ z@@ ang style would better study science , people of Mon@@ k Pi@@ g style should study liberal arts , those of S@@ and Mon@@ k style are supposed to learn engineering , while those of Monkey King style would better learn art .
from the angle of interpersonal relations , if parents and their kid are in the same quad@@ rant , it will be easier for them to understand each other , as the kid will do whatever parents ask him to do . that also works for boss @-@ employee relations .
generally speaking , dad knows more about his daughter , while mom is more aware of what &apos;s on her son &apos;s mind , as dad and daughter , mom and son , are very likely to be in the same quad@@ rant .
but in an equal relationship , it would be more important to have a companion in the opposite quad@@ rant .
everyone needs a friend that belongs to an opposite quad@@ rant , because he can offer help and suggestions to you from a new and totally different perspective .
it would be better if your sweetheart is in an opposite quad@@ rant , as love is to complement each other .
it &apos;s not easy for a couple of the same quad@@ rant to live together for long , because what you see in him is all your own shortcomings , and there is no way for you to ignore his flaws .
when you attempt to start a relationship with a guy in the opposite quad@@ rant , you may find faults with him at the very start , as he may behave totally different from you .
but once you really fall in love with him , you will find you cannot live without him . that &apos;s true love .
thinking preferences can also help people in love dilemma realize a crucial fact that if you want your beloved one to have the strengths that you appreciate , you must accept his corresponding shortcomings which he can never get rid of .
the same is true of education .
as far as I know , some people are trying hard to train their Monkey King @-@ like daughters to the elegant and well @-@ behaved ladies as they think girls should be like that , while some are striving to turn their Mon@@ k Pi@@ g @-@ style sons to the men with in@@ dom@@ itable spirit in a traditional sense as they deem boys should be like that .
educating a child against his nature will surely bring confusion and constraint to his life .
I have explicitly suggested in this parent @-@ child education book that parents of a Monkey King @-@ sty@@ led child should read Li Kai@@ fu &apos;s Wei@@ bo posts more closely .
besides , parents should also think outside the box rather than just stick to established practice .
I &apos;d like to take this chance to say &quot; thank you &quot; to my &quot; Pa@@ op@@ ao &apos;s mom . &quot;
after learning about thinking preferences , she has tried to make some change to the way she educ@@ ates Pa@@ op@@ ao , which is not easy at all .
usually people would consider to make some self @-@ change for three reasons : for career , for love or for children .
as to the former two , you can consider changing a target or even giving up if it &apos;s incredibly difficult to keep up on the way .
but you can never give up your child .
thank you .
in the face of children who are not good at self @-@ management , parents are willing to change their mind to adapt to their kids , which in my view is an ultimate spiritual progress .
its meaning and value are in@@ comparable to any other thoughts or doctrines .
it might be great for those who fulfill the task within the reach of their ability , but it would be more worthy of respect for those who do a job that they are not good at .
because there are love and dedication at the price of behaving against nature .
one day we will finally find that the so @-@ called success is mere worldly possessions .
and the so @-@ called love will eventually become a kind of family affection .
and no matter how deep it is , parents &quot; affection for their children will , just as the famous ess@@ ay@@ ist Long Ying@@ tai says , turn into a silent farewell .
however , it is the experience and the un@@ regre@@ tful devotion that brings us inspiring feelings and insights , which is probably the meaning of life .
thank you .
hello , everyone .
I was born a patient with congenital cataract .
in other words , I was destined to spend my life in the darkness since the very moment I was born .
at this moment , I would like to invite you to close your eyes and imagine the color blue in your mind .
I have never seen colors in my life .
some people once told me that the sky was blue and bright .
I then wondered how the sky looked like .
then other people told me that the sky was as blue as the ocean .
I didn &apos;t know how the ocean looked like either .
to be frank with you , till this moment I have no idea what is the ocean , and what exactly is the color blue .
when I close my eyes and think hard enough , I can only feel the vast@@ ness of darkness .
blindness is the most severe disability .
in our world we only see sheer darkness .
you now can see me clearly , standing in the middle of this theater .
however , the same theater in my eyes is a state of ni@@ h@@ ility .
we blind people manage to perceive our surrounding with auditory sense or with our own imagination .
we can &apos;t tell the beauty of this world , or the ador@@ abl@@ eness of flowers .
worse is that we can &apos;t know how our parents , wives and children look like , and we have to make up their images in our minds .
it is indeed very sadd@@ ening .
we have to rely our imagination to feel things and comprehend this world .
say , the concept of a pretty woman .
you can help me take a close look and tell me how many pretty women are present for today &apos;s event .
for our blind people , women with a pleasant voice must be nice @-@ looking ones .
it reminds me of a TV drama called Secret P@@ lot .
a B@@ ing had to rely on his ears to pick the girl he liked .
to be honest , we blind people will make a decision based on the information we have heard .
it is very typical for any blind person .
I &apos;m 38 years old now , but I can only write 1 , 2 and 3 .
most blind people don &apos;t know how to read and write , which is particularly annoying and troublesome in our daily life .
for example , we all need to go to a bank from time to time ; but it is problematic if we are asked to sign our names on any official papers .
we can &apos;t vote either , despite that the right to vote is the basic right for any citizen .
I can clearly tell disabled people and able @-@ bodied people are living in two totally different worlds .
I graduated from a special school in 1995 .
at that time I had no idea about my career development .
you might have questions to ask a blind person .
have you encountered any blind person in your daily life ?
what kinds of jobs are suitable for blind people ?
maybe they can work as a mass@@ ag@@ ist , or continue their academic study and become a Ph@@ d student .
but most of blind people end up becoming mass@@ ag@@ ists .
I followed the same development path , and opened a massage clinic to make ends meet .
however with the growth of my business , I started to face greater challenges .
for example , I didn &apos;t know how to read an account book , and customer flow and other basic statistical data were too difficult for me .
in other words , I didn &apos;t know how to properly manage my own business .
I long for any learning opportunity , and love to acquire new knowledge , including business administration related knowledge .
however , I couldn &apos;t do it , as I am a blind person .
life is too hard for me .
you may not be able to experience that kind of pain .
in 1999 , I over@@ heard something from the radio , saying that computer was the most powerful tool , and anyone who doesn &apos;t know how to use a computer would become an illiterate person in the 21st century .
I ended up buying a computer with a cost about 10,000 yuan , but I had a hard time in learning how to use it .
automatic Speech Recognition was still an immature technology at that time .
I had to learn D@@ OS command system and location input method in the first place , and spent another two years to learn how to type .
you might find it hard to understand .
the location input method required me to memorize all the Chinese characters I had learned .
for example , Jian , as in Chinese word Ji@@ ank@@ ang ， will appear as 29@@ 01 in my mind .
typing is now a piece of cake , but was extremely difficult in the past .
after I learned how to use a computer , China &apos;s first Computer Scre@@ en Reader , a software exclusively designed for the blind people , was introduced into the market place .
I immediately felt the overwhelming power of Microsoft Windows .
with the firm support from the Disabled People &apos;s Association , I opened computer training programs for blind people and ended up training a total of 600 students in 35 sessions .
it was an eye @-@ opening experience for me , and I understood better the agon@@ izing pain of the blind people .
a blind person once wrote me a letter , saying that &quot; It is my biggest dream to send a Q@@ Q message with my own mobile . &quot;
it is not only his dream , but mine as well .
at that time we blind people were unable to use a variety of digital products , and we were left several generations behind compared to the able @-@ bodied .
enlightened by this friend , I started telling myself , &quot; I have done enough as a mass@@ ag@@ ist . who is willing to do as a manual labor for an entire day ? I want to innovate , make myself independent and start my own business . &quot;
that was how I set up a science and technology company .
my idea was rather simple , and as a blind person myself , I wanted to empower other blind people .
by making full use of the strength of science and technology , blind people can see light and overcome the communication difficulty .
at that time my company only had one development goal , which was to tackle the technical problem for blind people not being able to use smart devices .
in the past 4 years , my company has developed Scre@@ en Reader software that can be installed at Nokia mobil@@ es and Andro@@ id mobil@@ es .
in other words , we have tackled the technical problem for blind people not being able to use smart devices .
in the past there was an un@@ brid@@ geable gap between blind people and able @-@ bodied people ; but thanks to our hard work , we have greatly narrowed the gap .
people now use Xia@@ om@@ i mobil@@ es a lot , and we blind people are also using Xia@@ om@@ i mobil@@ es .
there isn &apos;t any technical barrier at all .
to me , our software is more than a computer software , but eyes to our blind people , the very eyes to open the door of science and technology .
I had a junior school@@ mate whose hobby was writing ; however , writing was too difficult to her at that time .
she said , &quot; Each time when I need to look up something , I have to ask an able @-@ bodied person to check it up at a bookstore ; and then I need to put my ideas into B@@ rail@@ le alphabet , and ask my neighbor , when he is free , to listen to me reading the B@@ rail@@ le alphabet and translate the meaning into Chinese writing . and then I need to wait , waiting for someone to help me mail my writing to a publishing house when he or she happens to do the grocery shopping at a market . &quot;
she told me that the entire process was inconvenient and troublesome , in a sense , she found her self esteem had been severely hurt .
when she has learned the skills in using a mobile , she is able to look up information , write Chinese characters , and send e @-@ mails to different publishing houses all by herself .
she feels that she has re @-@ discovered the long lost self @-@ esteem .
to be honest , most blind people are desperate to learn new knowledge .
to tell you the truth , I quit my study upon my graduation from a junior middle school .
I didn &apos;t have a good learning environment at that time , despite that I was eager to continue my learning .
everyone wanted to learn new knowledge .
but the external environment was too hostile to us .
in the past we learned new things in a passive manner ; but now we can take the initiative to acquire knowledge .
for example , we can surf the Internet for the information we want , be it news , science and technology related knowledge or literature .
and literally we can read thousands of books , we can read almost the same books with able @-@ bodied people .
ghost B@@ lows Out the Light is a very popular online novel recently .
many people have read this book , and many blind people read this same book from their mobil@@ es .
to be frank with you , such kind of thing never happened in the past , it was simply un@@ imaginable .
how does a blind person read a book ?
I would like to do a demonstration here .
it &apos;s a touch screen smart@@ phone .
Hua@@ wei Gl@@ ory 2 should be considered as a high @-@ end smart@@ phone in the domestic market .
this is the reading interface .
I can close this interface directly by using this gesture .
this is how we blind people are using a smart@@ phone to read .
this might appear to be unbelievable to you , but this is exactly how we blind people read and learn .
in the past we could only rely on B@@ rail@@ le alphabet , but now we can directly use Chinese characters , pin@@ yin , or voice input , and communicate flaw@@ lessly with those able @-@ bodied people .
the gap has been greatly narrowed .
I have encountered many obstacles when trying to develop software exclusively for the use of blind people .
as we were developing a voice software , and the first obstacle was to figure out the communication mechanism between a blind person and another blind person , as well as between a blind person and an able @-@ bodied person .
our Scre@@ en Reader software was unable to read Q@@ Q messages .
you might know the operation rule of Q@@ Q , it would not allow any third party to access its information .
if the information could be intercep@@ ted , I think we won &apos;t have any privacy at all .
but if we need to translate a text message into a voice message , we must have an information interc@@ eption interface and translate the text into a voice message .
we spent 4 months in vain .
if we fail to overcome this technical difficulty , we can &apos;t release our mobile software at all .
I was so desperate at that time , and finally obtained the e @-@ mail address of P@@ ony Ma .
I decided to write him an e @-@ mail .
I wrote , &quot; I &apos;m a blind person , and I am willing to offer assistance to other blind people . I now ask for your help . &quot;
to my surprise , three days later , P@@ ony Ma asked one of his senior managers to contact me , and promised to develop a Q@@ Q voice interface for us , and it was free of charge .
after one month &apos;s joint development effort , a Q@@ Q exclusively for the use of blind people was put into use .
many blind people were moved to tears after hearing the news .
it means from then on the communication among blind people will see a fundamental change .
I have an old friend of mine , who has spent several years in looking for a suitable woman to be his wife . but his attempt was unsuccessful .
I can still recall vividly the sentence most spoken by our teachers at the special school .
they told us that , &quot; Try to look for Mr. Right or Miss Right within school , otherwise it might be too late for you guys . &quot;
why our teachers would say such things to us ?
it is because our teachers understand the hardship of our lives .
we would settle in different places upon leaving our school , and it is difficult to keep in touch with our school@@ mates .
it is relatively easy for able @-@ bodied people to keep in touch with each other .
they can say , &quot; Let &apos;s hang out in a pub or a coffee shop . &quot;
to tell you the truth , I have never been to a pub , and I have no idea what a pub looks like .
other blind people don &apos;t know either .
we blind people spend most of our time doing the massage ; and would listen to radio or play with mobil@@ es whenever we are free .
we don &apos;t have extra time to find a suitable marriage partner .
how would this situation change with the availability of this new type of Q@@ Q and touch screen @-@ enabled W@@ ech@@ at ?
in less than 3 years , over 2,000 pairs of blind people have tied the knot through online dating .
the friend I just mentioned was one of our earliest customers who bought a mobile with a pre @-@ installed screen reader software .
he is from Shandong province , and later dated a girl from Yun@@ an .
they got married in March this year .
imagine , these two people live far apart .
if there isn &apos;t any online communication means , the same communication means used by able @-@ bodied people , how can we overcome these difficulties ?
I have a friend who is a piano tuning specialist .
can you imagine that what would you think if your wife or your children were lost at 10 o &apos;clock at night ?
she took a taxi home and told her address to the taxi driver .
she was told to get off when arriving at the destination .
but the moment she got off the car she realized that her parents were not there .
she was panic , and immediately called her parents , &quot; Where are you ? I can &apos;t find you . &quot;
her parents were standing on the road , expecting their daughter .
they realized the seriousness of the situation that their daughter was lost .
a wandering girl at 10 : 30 pm .
what happened next ?
all neighbors were mobilized to help look for this girl .
they looked for another hour and finally found her at a small alley somewhere near her home .
what a danger !
the entire family were crying bitterly .
how do we handle this kind of situation nowadays ?
personally I can &apos;t get lost anymore .
we are now using a mobile equipped with GPS Satellite Pos@@ iti@@ oning system , and there is even a positioning system that is exclusively designed for blind people .
for example , after pressing this button , the system will tell me my whereabouts .
and I can pass the location information to my wife and to my other family members .
we have even developed an An@@ t Navi@@ gation System , which will guide a blind person to walk freely on the road .
you might not know the huge impact science and technology have brought to us blind people .
when I am walking on a B@@ rail@@ le road , I am in fear of something blocking my way .
I once was stopped by an aun@@ ty when I was walking .
she told me , &quot; Please stop , I will help you make a det@@ our . my shopping cart is standing in your way . &quot;
I felt embarrassed and annoyed , and replied , &quot; Why can &apos;t you remove the cart and let me continue walking along this B@@ rail@@ le road ? &quot;
this is a fine example .
we blind people ask for not only assistance from others , but also consideration and understanding .
you might be unfamiliar with chat tools used by blind people .
I will do a simple demonstration .
this is the W@@ ech@@ at interface we are using .
you can take a close look and find out whether it is the same with yours .
it is the same W@@ ech@@ at interface , and we don &apos;t make any change at all .
we can read news through mobil@@ es .
and sometimes we obtain the news much faster than the able @-@ bodied .
for example there was an earthquake happened in Y@@ a &apos;an a few days ago .
a blind person posted a message in his Wei@@ bo , announcing that there was an earthquake in Y@@ a &apos;an .
such a thing would never happen in the past .
and now we have all known the news .
in the past we only figured out what was going on after the repetitive news announcements in the radio .
see , the world is totally different .
this is a chatting platform , and I am sending a W@@ ech@@ at message to my friend .
press the button and speak .
hello , I &apos;m speaking at the T@@ n@@ Dao Forum .
the message will be sent when I raise my hand .
an able @-@ bodied person will do exactly the same .
you can tell that what I am working right now is not only to develop a software exclusively for the use of blind people , but also to bridge the gap between blind people and the able @-@ bodied people .
and this is my dream .
you might not know the exact population of blind people in China .
some able @-@ bodied people once told me , &quot; You keep telling me there are many blind people in China , how come there isn &apos;t any blind person in my daily life ? &quot;
it is not that you are unable to spot a blind person , but we blind people have great difficulties in going places .
there are a total of 11.@@ 7 million blind people in China .
11.@@ 7 million people , this is about the same size of population in Beijing .
how many of these 11.@@ 7 million blind people have received proper education ?
less than one in every thousand .
how many schools for the blind in China ?
less than twenty .
how many B@@ rail@@ le books are available in China ?
it costs at least dozens of yuan to produce one B@@ rail@@ le book .
for example , many of you have read the book Dem@@ i @-@ Gods and Sem@@ i @-@ Dev@@ ils .
its B@@ rail@@ le version covers 8 books , and the price for this set of books is 6@@ 40 yuan .
how many blind people can afford this set of books ?
we then had to borrow these books from the library , or listen to story telling in the Internet .
there are way too many blind people in China , and they are all facing great difficulties .
I want to make a software that can be helpful to them .
I hope , and this is also the ultimate goal of my company , that someday all blind people in China can use my software free of charge , let this software serve as their eyes to see the world .
how can this software make available to blind people ?
I am now asking for assistance from all able @-@ bodied people in our society , so that we blind people can access this software through government procurement .
as of now , our company has a total of 80,000 registered users .
I hope that someday 8@@ 00,000 blind people , or 8 million blind people will be able to use this software .
by lever@@ aging the means of government procurement and the power of people from all walks of life , we can narrow the gap between blind people and the able @-@ bodied people .
and this is exactly my dream , and the dream of my company .
and most of my employees are blind people , they will eventually find a new path that is un@@ qi@@ ue to them .
I sincerely hope that , some day , blind people and able @-@ bodied people can join hands together , shoulder to shoulder , to appreciate the blue sky and the vast@@ ness of the ocean .
thank you .
hello everyone ! I bring up a question for you : which one do you think is safer in the sense of food safety ?
habitually we would jump to the right answer that we believe .
but I say hold on , let me finish and you would answer then .
I &apos;m always feeling puzzled when asked by my friends : &quot; what can we eat and what can &apos;t we eat ? . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t answer that .
why ?
many experts offered their answers to this question , most bull@@ shit .
this is a question with infinite answers , which is , to our knowledge , no answer .
so , what do we mean by no answer ?
let &apos;s say in this formula x + a = a + x , the value of the x is infinite .
but the formula itself is false in the first place .
so whether it is a legitimate question is a question .
now let &apos;s see what we can do for this question with infin@@ it answers , or no answer .
since the Industrial Revolution in the UK , the humankind syn@@ the@@ tized 30 million kinds of compounds .
and nowadays 1 million or so new compounds are created annually in the laboratory by chem@@ ists .
many of which nowhere to be found in the natural world are invented by us human , creation of the God .
some people say &quot; Being natural is always good , while being man @-@ made is prone to problems . &quot;
I don &apos;t think it as a constant golden rule , rather the opposite always prevails .
how is that ?
it &apos;s not the compound per se that matters when we are to judge a compound toxic or non @-@ toxic .
before the Renaissance in the 15 @-@ 16th century in the West , there was a Swiss doctor and al@@ chem@@ y named Par@@ ac@@ el@@ sus in the Middle Ages , and he said once : dosage determines the toxicity .
there are many things we human beings find indispensable , such as oxygen and water , without which we could not live .
but some people would suffer oxygen poisoning due to excessive in@@ hale of oxygen .
similar cases are water poisoning , vitamins poisoning , especially fat @-@ soluble vitamins .
now we often hear about sel@@ enium poisoning .
sel@@ enium is a chemical element with antic@@ ancer effects .
but the intake of sel@@ enium has to be no more and no less .
according to my knowledge there are two famous places rich in sel@@ enium in China , one in the En@@ shi area of Hubei Province ; the other in Zi@@ yang Country in the Southern Shaanxi .
in Zi@@ yang , people produce high @-@ sel@@ enium tea leaves and high @-@ sel@@ enium cor@@ ns .
I &apos;ve been there and I saw many people were poisoned with sel@@ enium in both places .
the story tells us that the proper dosage is delicate and essential to our health and safety .
no more , no less .
therefore , we have the public health control system in place to manage and control the problem of dosage .
now the second story .
it &apos;s about two common things .
one is the roasted duck which could be found everywhere in China .
but we narrow it down to the Beijing roo@@ sted Duck for an example .
and the other is torto@@ is@@ es@@ hell just showed in the screen , or more specifically PA@@ H .
so , what is the problem with the two things ?
everyone is familiar with the Quan@@ j@@ ude Ro@@ asted Duck , without knowing that there are two predecessors and one is called Men@@ lu Ro@@ sted Duck ( duck roasted in the oven ) .
it works this way : heat the oven first , put the duck in , and close the door . no flame seen .
there is a time @-@ honored Men@@ lu Ro@@ asted Duck restaurant in Beijing called Bi@@ any@@ i@@ fang , which have been open in the Ming Dynasty and struggled to exist till now .
the other is Gu@@ al@@ u Ro@@ sted Duck ( duck roasted over the fire ) , and we know from the name that it involves fire and firewood below , and it would be seen raw if a chef changes the place of the duck with a fork .
the history of the roasted duck dates back to the Southern Song Dynasty when the Lin &apos;an Ro@@ sted Duck was popular and Bo Yan , the general of the Yuan army carried off the famous chefs to the capital D@@ ad@@ u from Lin &apos;an after the defeat of the Southern Song army , making the roasted duck a supreme delicacy in the Yuan palace .
according to the literature , in 13@@ 30 , a man wrote a book , or a collection of work notes of his work in the Yuan palace as a chief cook , and roasted ducks were found in the book .
back in the Ming Dynasty in 14@@ 16 , the Men@@ lu Ro@@ sted Duck was very popular even in the Palace .
and Bi@@ any@@ i@@ fang was the very first Men@@ lu Ro@@ sted Duck Restaurant in Beijing since then .
the restaurant is still operating in Xi@@ any@@ uk@@ ou , outside of Qi@@ anmen , with its business on and off through the long history .
then when the Gu@@ al@@ u Ro@@ sted Duck appeared ?
according to literature it &apos;s believed that there was Gu@@ al@@ u Ro@@ sted Duck in the Qing Palace during the reign of Emperor Qi@@ an@@ long .
when did Quan@@ j@@ ude emerge ?
about the 18@@ 60 @-@ 18@@ 64 during the reign of Emperor Tong@@ zhi , way after Bi@@ any@@ i@@ fang .
but now the Gu@@ al@@ u Ro@@ sted Duck gains the popularity .
I have tried both and I think the Gu@@ al@@ u roasted duck tastes much better than the Men@@ lu roasted duck .
for the second common thing , PA@@ H , what &apos;s that ?
from the torto@@ is@@ es@@ hell we could see six @-@ benzene rings and five @-@ benzene rings , and putting all this together we could get the PA@@ H .
if benzene rings with bond doesn &apos;t count , we have four @-@ benzene rings , or benz@@ op@@ y@@ rene .
there are 200 @-@ 300 kinds of PA@@ H , with benz@@ op@@ y@@ rene as a typical case of strong toxicity .
speaking of benz@@ op@@ y@@ rene , there is a special international cancer institute of the WHO in Ly@@ on , France called I@@ ARC .
this organization specializes in determining the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity of all compounds .
benz@@ op@@ y@@ rene is a member of Group One by I@@ ARC .
what does this mean ?
evidence @-@ based carcin@@ ogen@@ icity to human body .
of course , there are still Group 2@@ A and 2@@ B , which are under Group one .
but we are talking about roasted ducks .
for the sake of research , we collected three kinds of roasted duck .
the Men@@ lu roasted duck , for one , was collected in Beijing .
and the Gu@@ al@@ u roasted duck was bought in one of the three branches of Quan@@ j@@ ude in Shanghai .
and here is what it looks like .
we put it down and bought it back .
the third one , a Quan@@ j@@ ude branch in Pudong , Shanghai , which uses electricity to roast ducks , not fire .
we tested all three roasted ducks in skin , meat and bones , and didn &apos;t find any benz@@ op@@ y@@ rene in duck meat .
but high concentration of benz@@ op@@ y@@ rene was found in the duck skin of Quan@@ j@@ ude , above the national level .
the national level is 5 m@@ c@@ g for a 5 @-@ kil@@ o roasted duck .
and we tested 8 m@@ c@@ g in those duck skin .
comparatively , we checked to know that such level exceeds the standards for all roasted poultry products in Europe .
unfortunately , the duck skin is the best of a roasted duck , so the problem must be in the roasted duck skin , right ?
and this is a problem .
meanwhile , it &apos;s terrible for people to eat ducks with higher level of benz@@ op@@ y@@ rene than the national level and European levels .
so what should we do ?
we conducted a safety evaluation .
generally we collected a few dozen of roasted duck of the same kind as samples , averaging about 2 kil@@ o each .
let &apos;s say one roasted duck for four people to eat , that would mean 0.@@ 68@@ m@@ c@@ g of benz@@ op@@ y@@ rene in the duck skin in one meal .
still higher than the average level set by the European Food Safety Agency , which is between 0.2 + and -@@ 0.4 .
besides roasted duck , we tested vegetables as well .
thanks to the statistics released by J@@ EC@@ FA , an expert committee on food additives of WHO and FAO , we know the content of benz@@ op@@ y@@ rene in vegetables in Northern China , which would not go public before China submitted it to the committee .
and we know the bottom line is 4@@ 40@@ g per person per day , meaning 2@@ mg per day , much higher than the 0.@@ 68@@ m@@ c@@ g in duck skin .
by now we know that vegetables aren &apos;t necessarily safe for sure .
and this is one more problem .
so with data we have to rethink concepts and things .
and what can we conclude by now ?
first , conventional or habitual ideas are not always right or safe .
vegetables are not necessarily safer than roasted ducks .
is it a safe to eat roasted ducks ?
well , people don &apos;t eat roasted ducks every day .
the sal@@ ariat would not have it every week , nor would successful rich men .
in addition , roasted ducks are served with vegetables , making it ta@@ ste@@ ful and healthy .
this leads me to an interesting question , &quot; Can we leave the Earth by pulling our hair ? &quot;
so back to the question that I couldn &apos;t answer my friends , what did I respond ?
for close friends , I &apos;d say &quot; Can you leave the Earth by pulling your hair ? and if you can &apos;t , don &apos;t ask me such question as what can be eaten and what cannot . &quot;
of course it &apos;s impossible for us to leave the Earth pulling our hair , then what should we do ?
because even if you are a professional , you don &apos;t have a chemist around all the time .
so what to do ?
here is my advice : you could eat anything but not excessive .
you can favor one particular food but don &apos;t stick to one brand .
and this is called risk spreading .
in conclusion , I &apos;d say it &apos;s still infinite if you add one to infinity , so what did I just say to you .
you would ask me for answer , for solution , and I &apos;m asking myself , too .
thank you very much .
hello everyone !
I &apos;m Li Xiang , founder of Auto@@ home , an automobile transaction website .
my speech today is named &quot; The De@@ termin@@ ants of Success In Early En@@ tre@@ pre@@ neur@@ ship . &quot;
I myself have two entrepreneurial experiences .
the first time was when I was 19 , I set up PC@@ PO@@ P , a consumer electronics website .
I made mistakes and missed many important opportunities , which , however , turned into precious experience that helped me do better during my second entrepreneurship .
it is my second entrepreneurship that I want to focus on today .
I &apos;ll talk about how , within three years , our traffic managed to lead in the intensely competitive sector of automobile websites .
Auto@@ home , also my second entrepreneurship , was launched in the second half of year 2004 .
the timing was mainly attributed to two reasons .
the first reason was that all the existing automobile websites then were awful .
yes , you hear me right , terribly awful .
no site was thinking or designing products from the angle of automobile consumers .
we believed we could beat them .
the second reason was that the automobile market then was a pure seller &apos;s market .
automobile producers , who never worried about sales , kept increasing their automobile prices .
but we firmly believed that in three years , the seller &apos;s market would shift into a buyer &apos;s market , where consumers would have the final say .
the thing is , any website who could then put itself in the consumers &apos; shoes would end up as the final winner !
it was a golden opportunity , for it combined almost everything that was favorable to us .
we decided on the second half of 2004 to start our business .
I remember at the beginning , when I told many friends I was preparing for the launch of an automobile website .
they unanimously advised me to seek help from experienced editors who were working in automobile websites or media .
but I refused to listen to them .
because no automobile website or media then was producing content that I desired , I chose to start from scratch .
later that year , we hired the first batch of our employees , all newly graduating from universities , and the name of their universities didn &apos;t matter too much to us .
China Agricultural University might be the best @-@ known in our company .
most of our young employees graduated from very ordinary universities , and over half of them didn &apos;t even have a driver &apos;s license .
that &apos;s how we began .
then it took us about half a year to establish the website &apos;s releasing program , forums , as well as these pages that you can see , and subsequent additions to them .
on June 1st 2015 , Auto@@ home was officially launched .
what was the automobile website market like back then ?
many automobile websites were receiving generous investment .
Chin@@ ac@@ ar in particular , I remember , got an investment worth about 40 million USD .
we seemed to make ourselves a joke in the sector , when we gathered a group of IT people and newly @-@ graduated youths , and vowed to construct a No.1 automobile website in future .
stand@@ ers @-@ by were waiting to see us fail .
for eight years they waited , but we let them down .
so why did they think of us as a joke ?
like I said , we were just a bunch of IT people plus some young graduates .
compared with our rivals , we had nothing to boast about .
no resources .
no connections in the automobile industry .
we didn &apos;t even have a strong team , or money .
before X@@ ue Man@@ zi invested some money in 2006 , we were all but pen@@ n@@ il@@ ess .
our employees didn &apos;t ask much .
they were paid 1500 RMB per month , which was a very low salary .
then our website thus began to operate .
from 2005 we fought three yearly battles , which helped us lead in traffic .
the first battle occurred between 2005 and 2006 .
so what was it about ?
we call it the &quot; Battle of Real @-@ life Phot@@ ograph@@ s . &quot;
what did it mean ?
back in 2005 the automobile websites , unlike what we see today , were different in sty@@ ling .
all their photographs were official versions provided by automobile producers .
what do official photographs mean then ?
they are photographs that have been artificially processed , like the Korean beau@@ ties you watch on TV .
but that was not what the consumers truly wanted .
they just wanted to see automobiles without wearing &quot; make @-@ up . &quot;
we noticed such a demand on the part of consumers .
if we wanted to buy a car , I guess nobody would wish to be tr@@ icked by an artificially processed picture , when we were browsing through the online photographs .
so we dispatched our editors into automobile 4@@ S stores , where real automobiles were displayed .
we shot photos of those automobiles as they were , and categorized them
according to their appearance , central control , seat and other aspects .
on the one hand , that helped consumers search according to the automobile model , color and other things .
they might feel as if they were looking around in a real 4@@ S store .
on the other hand , that facilitated comparison between different automobiles .
for example , if you wanted to choose among a PO@@ L@@ O , a S@@ ail and a P@@ AL@@ IO , you could parallel their photographs in one place at a time and take a close look .
it was just like that we guided all Chinese consumers to experience a real 4@@ S store .
simple as it might sound , this trait of our website laid a crucial foundation for our future traffic .
within one year from 2005 to 2006 , the traffic of our website jumped into the top 5 on the ranking list of all automobile websites from below the 100@@ th place .
that was our first victory !
later when I was with people who also worked in this field .
they would ex@@ claim , &quot; W@@ ow , you really did a good job .
you were really insi@@ ghtful when you knew from the very beginning that a photo library displaying real products was the kn@@ ack .
but we knew that was not the case . why did we build our own photo library ?
because back in 2005 , no automobile maker was willing to let Auto@@ home test their automobiles .
nor would they allow Auto@@ home to attend a test drive .
so there was no chance for us to get access to the automobiles provided by automobile makers or to shoot their photos .
4@@ S store was what we only got .
yes , we treas@@ ured our chances there in the 4@@ s stores .
that said , the truth is that , whether it was in 2005 or in 20@@ 13 , anyone with a camera might find that they were free to shoot car photos in any 4@@ S store .
that &apos;s true .
we won our first battle , in which we shot real @-@ life automobile photos in 4@@ S stores and uploaded them to our website .
then came our second battle between 2006 and 2007 .
we name it the &quot; Battle of Chang@@ ing the Up@@ dates Tim@@ et@@ able . &quot;
what did it mean ?
I myself was also an automobile consumer .
the reason why I wanted to build my own automobile website in the first place was that I felt all the other automobile websites were just too awful .
for example , they didn &apos;t update content on weekends or holidays .
sound un@@ scientific , right ?
weekends are usually online time , say , if you want to buy a car , you definitely would like to surf some automobile web pages on a free Saturday or Sunday .
think how disappointed you would feel when you log onto a website , only to find that there are no updates at all .
so we came up with an ide@@ a.@@ We would work on Saturdays , preparing all the updated content that was to be released on weekends .
our programmers also designed a convenient releasing program to make sure all our updated content could be appropriately distributed among all weekends and important holidays .
what benefits would that bring ?
just imagine , when you were browsing through automobile websites on weekends , if there was only one website that was updated , would you just love that website ?
I bet the answer would be a definite &quot; Yes . &quot;
besides weekends , we found that all the automobile websites also seemed to be lazy in the morning .
that was not cool .
take me for example . I habitually begin my day with opening my laptop , going online and receiving emails while surfing some of my favorite websites .
if there are no updates on them , I &apos;ll just feel like I &apos;m eating a fly . that feeling su@@ cks .
anyway , like I said , with the help of our convenient releasing program , our website was able to get our updates ready even in the afternoon ahead of the morning scheduled for updates releasing .
that has been our routine from then on .
every morning , weekend or holiday you open an Auto@@ home page , you &apos;ll find there is always something updated .
only one website has kept such a frequency of updating so far .
it &apos;s Auto@@ home .
that was the second battle we won .
after the victory of our first battle , other automobile websites began to imitate our mode of building a photo library .
the way photos are taken and viewed on all the automobile websites today was actually created by Auto@@ home in 2005 .
in comparison , however , our second battle cannot be copied .
none of our rivals has caught up as yet .
after the second battle , people from other automobile websites would come to me and say , &quot; Li Xiang , you are really good at increasing the online traffic . so are you using Baidu &apos;s Search Engine Optim@@ ization ( SE@@ O ) ? &quot;
I am that kind of person who never speaks much , but whenever I speak , I &apos;ll tell the truth .
so I told them things were not like what they imagined .
before our website and traffic hit No.1 in the field , none of us had ever engaged with SE@@ O , or rather , we never engage in SE@@ O .
I was straight with them , &quot; If you could only update your content in the morning , on weekends and important holidays , your traffic would be doubled . &quot;
they were like , &quot; Right ! I got it ! &quot;
but when they went back , nothing changed .
therefore , that was our second battle , the &apos; Battle of Chang@@ ing the Up@@ dates Tim@@ et@@ able , &quot; which brought our website from top 5 to top 3 in terms of traffic .
it occurred at the beginning of 2007 .
our third battle was named the &quot; Battle of Al@@ ways Rel@@ easing Test @-@ drive Articles a Step A@@ head . &quot;
from 2007 , with our traffic increasing and our reputation rising , we began to be noticed by automobile makers and their PR firms .
we had the chance to be invited to the test drives organized by automobile makers , or the launches of new cars .
I still remember the first time we attended a test drive for a new car .
things were different back then .
today we have dozens of new cars launched every month , but in 2007 , one new car per month was a big number .
consumers were just eager for information about new cars , and whoever first released test @-@ drive articles would definitely get a head start .
at that time , the media invited to a test drive generally needed three days at least to edit their test @-@ drive articles .
most of the automobile media would just adopt the press releases and official photos provided by automobile makers and make few changes before they released them .
I saw that as a great opportunity .
consumers were tired of the same content repeated here and there .
nor would they want to wait for three days before they could read an article about the latest test drive .
we wanted to do things differently .
so we gathered our core team and announced that we were going to attend a test drive .
it would be our first time .
I asked them when we could release our test @-@ drive article .
some of my colleagues said , &quot; U@@ su@@ ally they need three days , but we can be quicker . let &apos;s reduce it to two . &quot;
some suggested the next day after the test drive .
&quot; in that way we can be much ahead , &quot; they insisted .
finally we made a tough decision : first , we must complete our article on the very day of the test drive , no matter how late we had to stay up ; second , we must not copy the automobile maker &apos;s press releases or the official photos .
instead , our content and photographs must be original .
that was what we decided on .
for an automobile editor , attending a test drive is actually an enjoyable experience .
why do I say that ?
you see , first , the test drive is usually held in very famous scenic spots or places of interest either in China or abroad , such as S@@ anya , Jiu@@ z@@ ha@@ ig@@ ou , Xiamen and Qingdao .
second , you can live in the best hotels , which are at least five @-@ star , and are usually brand @-@ new .
third , if you have to fly , then for any flight beyond 200@@ 0@@ km , you can have a business class seat .
there are also high @-@ end recreational activities after the test drive arranged by automobile makers for the media .
but one editor , instead of joining the jam@@ bo@@ ree after the test drive , chose to retreat to his hotel and edit his article .
this website was Auto@@ home .
those days , if you could edit and complete your article on the very day of the test drive , you were sure to win half , if not the whole , of the world belonging to automobile websites .
thus we went on attending test drives and launches and releasing our articles always one step ahead .
on most occasions we released articles on the very day of the campaign .
one year into this , the traffic of our website rose to the 1st place on the ranking list .
it took us three years to make our traffic lead in the intensely competitive field of automobile websites .
that was the third battle we fought .
our first two battles rarely upset other automobile websites .
but this last one struck them hard .
due to this last battle , they might still harbor a grudge against us .
why do I say that ?
because attending to a test drive used to be like going on holiday for them .
but we changed that .
the head start we might get upset them and forced them to stay up late too .
some of them even resorted to very dirty means , for example , they would persuade the PR firms and automobile makers to sign a confidentiality agreement with the media beforehand , which stipulated that the media &apos;s article must not be released on the day of the test drive , but rather , had to wait till three days later .
whatever countermeasures they took , nothing could stop us .
I believed , as far as the consumers are concerned , the releasing of the test @-@ drive article should be the fastest , the best .
therefore , that was how we took the lead in traffic by fighting three battles .
we also waged other battles after that , like those aimed at increasing revenues and promoting the interactive products .
but I can tell you , what I like best and miss most is still our first three battles .
I keep looking back at the things we did in the first three years .
here I want to ask you a question , &quot; Does shooting photos in 4@@ S stores sound hard to you ? &quot;
I bet all of you can do that , right ?
then what about working for yet another day on Saturday ?
I believe you too can do it .
how about having less sleep after the test drive ?
that would not be a problem for you .
I remember asking our newly @-@ employed editors after I told them about our first three battles .
&quot; what are the chances of you , through hard work , being admitted by the Autom@@ obile Department of Tsinghua University ? &quot;
they frow@@ ned .
obviously there was a 99 percent chance that they would fail ..
then I asked them , &quot; Do you think you could quickly grow into an automobile expert within two or three years ? &quot;
that would even be harder for them .
without an accredited diploma in automobile and at least ten years of working experience in the automobile industry , no one is likely to be recognized as an expert .
but when I asked them &quot; Is it all right if you have to get up earlier and have a heavier workload ? &quot;
they unanimously gave me a positive answer .
Auto@@ home has made a lot of innovative attempts so far .
some people praise us for our success in raising our traffic to the 1st place among all vertical websites .
that &apos;s just a good result following a good process .
that &apos;s not our core .
the real core of our website lies in our first three battles - those battles that anyone , so long as he is willing to fight , can win in the end .
what &apos;s the most important in the fighting ?
first , just do it ; second , do your best ; and third , hold on to it .
the three points work for both entrepreneurship and our own growth .
let me say it again : first , just do it ; second , do your best ; and third , hold on to it .
and I believe all of you can do that .
that &apos;s all for my speech today .
thank you !
let &apos;s start with marital relations .
on a grand wedding , the mother of the bride talked on the stage to the sweet couple sincerely .
&quot; the two of you come from different family backgrounds with different hab@@ bits and now you became a family . I wish you hold each other &apos;s hands for a lifetime . please keep in mind that the truth of marriage is to respect and tolerate your life partner because the equation of mar@@ rage is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 . &quot;
hearing her words , the guests may react just like you , &quot; She has surely learnt about the true significance of marriage from her own . &quot;
but wait , is it true ?
does marriage really mean &quot; 0.5 plus 0.5 equals 1 &quot; ?
I was whole in the first place .
however , if tolerance in marriage means that we should turn from a whole person to a half , then why bother getting married when we can live a decent life alone in today &apos;s society ?
according to our study on intimate relationships , &quot; 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 &quot; is an equation people made when marriage was considered as a life @-@ time commitment that could not be broken .
however , now the significance of marriage lies in the happiness and growth people get in a marital relationship .
therefore a healthy intimate relationship should be 1 + 1 ≧ 1 .
nevertheless , what the mother said made sense because we indeed have to deal with various kinds of differences with our partners .
for instance , there are differences between men and women , between our parents and us , between our children and us .
a game women love most is the game of guessing .
after being married for years , for every important holidays or our birthdays , our husbands will always ask what gifts we want for the occasion .
&quot; up to you &quot; is our answer .
we never tell them our exact ideas for we want them to guess .
but husbands know nothing of romance and always make the wrong guess .
we feel rather disappointed for we believe the ultimate love is when your partner gets you even if you don &apos;t say anything , that is love .
however , men are strange creatures with different way of thinking .
they argue that they couldn &apos;t have known since they cannot read your minds .
so these differences exist in our marriage life for years .
we think that our partner does not get us , we are frustrated at their behavior and we feel un@@ loved .
these differences take the toll to our marriage so we have to deal with them .
as I study anthropology , I find Fei Xia@@ ot@@ ong has the best explanation for differences when he was conducting ethn@@ ical research .
and I quote , &quot; Ap@@ preci@@ ate the values of others as do to one &apos;s own and the world will become a harmonious whole . &quot;
he came up with it when he studied China &apos;s ethnic groups , believing that each ethnic group should maintain its own values and aes@@ thetical standards .
however , the values and aes@@ thetical standards of one ethnic group may appear wrong even dist@@ a@@ ste@@ ful to another ethnic group .
it is common that an aggressive ethnic group coer@@ ces another one to adap@@ tion in their early contact .
during the process , the frequent outbreaks of ethnic conflicts make it impossible for a harmonious coexistence among people .
but then we would discover that , well , after multiple interactions between different ethnic groups , we would notice that although their aes@@ thetical and value standards are different from ours , they have their own values .
with further communication , it turns out that one day we start to appreciate the different dances and religious beliefs .
as we constantly enhance the mutual understanding and communication , we start to respect and advocate different values , and appreciate the differences .
due to the different values and cultural diversity , the world is getting more beautiful .
only in this way can we respond to the call of the Communist Party of China to build a harmonious society .
we can also apply it in our family life for it works the same way .
it is just easier said that done .
let me take a few examples .
I bet you all know him , the hero of the most famous case of how @-@ to @-@ screw @-@ over @-@ your @-@ father last year .
he was a brilliant teenager with great artistic talent before the incident .
Li Shu@@ ang@@ jiang , his father , was very proud of his son &apos;s talent and shared in the show of A Date with Lu@@ yu .
he said that , &quot; I have always wanted my son to grow up freely and have the power to love .
I gave him freedom so he could make great arti@@ si@@ tic achievements .
he said the mother was very strict and he disagreed with her , saying that only when the child was free to explore his artistic talent could he have a bright future .
after things went wrong for Li Ti@@ any@@ i , the public unanimously blamed Li Shu@@ ang@@ jiang for his parenting , accusing him of spo@@ iling his son and claiming that he deserved it .
but let &apos;s think it all over .
isn &apos;t it right to give our kids the freedom to grow ?
as we all know , it &apos;s necessary for the kids to know the rules and be strictly guided to obey the rules in the process of growing up .
in the meantime , it &apos;s necessary to give them free space to grow freely .
both educational methods are essential to the kids .
spo@@ iling is not necessarily wrong and strict education neither .
therefore , going to extremes should be avoided .
kids should be taught in both ways and the differences between the two educational methods should coexist .
ob@@ liter@@ ation and criticism against each other should be avoided .
that is what cher@@ ishing each other &apos;s values means .
let the differences be as they have the very season to exist .
but it &apos;s really hard to put it into practice , at least for me .
take a personal example .
one day my daughter took back her math test from the primary school , I found her score was less than 80 , the cut @-@ off score .
I talked to her softly , &quot; Baby girl , let &apos;s find out together why you made mistakes and figure out how to correct them . &quot;
I was satisfied with my am@@ icable manner .
because I was good at parenting and didn &apos;t scold her .
then my husband returned home .
&quot; let me have a look at the test paper . I &apos;m good at math . &quot; he said .
he looked through the paper , &quot; This is a careless mistake , I see . it doesn &apos;t count . &quot;
&quot; why is the answer to this question wrong ? mis@@ calculation ? can you work out the right answer ? I bet you can . OK , it also doesn &apos;t count . &quot;
in the end , he claimed that her actual score was 99 .
I wonder how he could let her realize her mistakes in this way .
but I knew I couldn &apos;t challenge him in front of our daughter because we approached parenting differently .
so I just waited to check the outcome .
it turned out that she had made constant improvement in math from then on .
because she had faith in herself , believing she could do better next time every@@ time she made mistakes .
at that point , she need to find out the right answers , but most importantly , she needed to build up her confidence .
so I figured the meaning of the saying &quot; the differences have the right to exist &quot; is that when others have different opinions , it is possible that they are right .
just like dating is different from marriage .
we are pleased to find out that our boy@@ friends are very generous , a loyal friend with many people around , but after we marry them , we start to complain about him not taking care of the family or being busy with business outside .
actually it was not their personalities but the scenarios that have changed .
before the marriage , husbands are proud of the pretty and sub@@ missive girl@@ friends , but after getting married , they feel exhausted by the over @-@ dependent wives who can &apos;t do anything on their own .
those are identical features in different scenarios .
therefore , &quot; to appreciate others &apos; values &quot; is to see the shining points of people .
it is really hard to change people for it is a matter of personality .
if we just focus on the strengths of others , they will be encouraged to do better in the right areas .
in fact , differences can bring us more benefits than we thought .
I lived in the US for quite a long time .
despite the safe traffic there , I never gave a thought to driving on my own due to my poor sense of direction and bad driving skills .
driving on the American highway , for me , was scary .
in the October of last year 2012 , I and my husband went to Los Angeles to stay there for five days .
however , when we were in Los Angeles he told me that he needed to stay in San Francisco for 2 days .
in my opinion , it would save more time by plane .
but he insisted on hiring a car and driving there .
it takes seven hours to drive from Los Ang@@ els to San Francisco , so it &apos;s 14 hours back and forth .
for me , driving for 14 hours in two days to finish the round trip was scary .
I refused to go together but he insisted .
I gave in at last for he accompanied me in this American trip to attend a conference , so we hired a car and hit the road .
to my surprise , the highway from Los Ang@@ els to San Francisco was such a feast to the eye .
I couldn &apos;t be more impressed .
on the way , my husband shared with me his understanding of the US and the life , then I got to know his dreams and ideas .
if it hadn &apos;t been my husband , if there hadn &apos;t been the differences between us , I could never have tried things like this and I would thus miss those beauty in life .
thanks to him who is different from me , I can embrace a world different from mine .
when we encounter problems , we can come up with two different solutions .
we offer our child two options .
we tell her that , &quot; Wh@@ en@@ ever you encounter a problem , mum may tell you to do like this and dad could say a different thing . &quot;
our kid said , &quot; O@@ k , I have to think over those two options and figure out which one is better . &quot;
our life becomes extremely wonderful and interesting because of the differences .
that is the harmony after we appreciate the values of others and our differences .
at this stage , we would find out that a true intimate relationship is not defined by desperate love when we can &apos;t survive without each other .
on the contrary , we should be able to live a better life without our loved one around .
life is better when I am with you and I am better with you because you feel the same way .
only then could an intimate relationship give out the positive vi@@ bes .
for only when there is the power of love could we embrace the differences .
only when we constantly experience confl@@ its could we figure out our bottom lines and how far we would compromise .
only then could we discover the beauty of a harmonious relationship .
we live on the one side and enjoy the grass the other side .
from now on , let &apos;s learn to respect and appreciate the differences , to enjoy the diversified and beautiful life .
thanks !
good evening , everyone !
my topic today is : there is no arts after the Song and Yuan dynasties in China .
this is a topic that even myself refused to admit in the past .
I started to learn painting since I was very young , and the ancient arts of China was my favorite .
at that time , if someone told me that there was no arts after the Song and Yuan dynasties , I would defin@@ ately fight with him , regardless of how slim my chance of winning might be .
however , after several years of learning , comparing and thinking , I became old enough to know that my father was actually not so robust and inv@@ incible as I thought in my childhood .
no matter how he wanted to protect me , he couldn &apos;t always win in a fight .
so what was Chinese arts like after the Song and Yuan dynasties ?
let &apos;s compare this two sets of paintings .
this painting is The Three Gr@@ aces by R@@ aff@@ ael S@@ anti , one of the three distinguished men of art during the Renaissance . he enjoys a great reputation in the art history .
now we are seeing a series of female @-@ them@@ ed paintings by top @-@ level western artists from the Renaissance to the modern times . all female subject .
this is one from Ren@@ oir , a master of Im@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism in the 19th century .
and here &apos;s one from M@@ atis@@ se of the 20th century .
quite similar to The Three Gr@@ aces , right ?
they have the same composition but totally opposite styles .
Pic@@ asso .
he once said that he wanted to become a worm so that he could get into M@@ atis@@ se &apos;s head and see what he was thinking .
you must know this one , by Andy War@@ hol .
the painting is now on display at the Power Station of Art , and you may pay a visit if you are interested .
those are some female su@@ jects in paintings of some representative western artists from the Renaissance .
now let &apos;s see how Chinese artists portrayed females from the Yuan Dynasty till now .
yuan Dynasty .
Zhang Ling of the Ming Dynasty .
you may not know this artist .
he is in fact very famous and prominent in the art history .
you know this one , Tang Yin .
this is the most famous and best @-@ selling beauty painter in the Qing Dynasty .
and this is Zhang Da@@ q@@ ian .
well then , if I put those paintings together , unless you are a professional , otherwise I assume it is difficult for you to identify the painter of each one .
but with the first set of paintings , of which the painter all them@@ ed at women in different time starting from the Renaissance , are easy to distinguish , whether for amate@@ urs or professionals .
so , why is that ?
as I see it , it is quite interesting that the style and implications of Chinese paintings seem to stag@@ nate after the Song and Yuan Dynasty .
and the pain@@ ters since Song and Yuan , whether them@@ ed in landscapes , birds and flowers or figures , con@@ formed to the pattern of this period in terms of the form , the implication and the style .
however , in the western world , every new movement since Renaissance was based on the challenge to the former pattern and breakthroughs .
it followed closely the trend of world civilization and drive it forward conversely .
but we had our time .
there is no need of getting disappointed just yet , I have to remind you that we did have our glorious days .
this is a western portrait of the Middle Ages .
isn &apos;t this dull ?
but before this , Chinese people were creating paintings like this .
so imaginative !
it &apos;s the Picture of The O@@ de of the River Go@@ ddess .
here &apos;s a copy version of the Song Dynasty , for the original had been lost .
and this is only a part of the long scroll .
if you see the entire scroll , you will be amazed at its fertile imagination and you would take it for an American science fiction movies .
another well @-@ known one from the Tang Dynasty .
this a part of Han Ban@@ quet Map from the Five Dynasties .
Chinese had already managed to create paintings of such high quality when the works of wester@@ ners were still dull .
how come ?
I think we must have lost something that the Chinese arts came to a halt .
owing to this , pain@@ ters since the Yuan Dynasty only followed established concepts and patterns .
our host just said that he had a definition of art .
personally I think that , from the ancient times till now , the definition of art is changing continuously .
there is no need of settling down on one fixed definition .
the development in human civilization in every dynasty and historical period would inf@@ use art with some new elements , thus a new definition .
however , there has not been any new understanding of art since the Yuan dynasty in China .
some Chinese pain@@ ters argued indig@@ n@@ antly that it &apos;s because western paintings sell far more expensive than Chinese paintings do , and that once China become more developed and rich than western countries , our paintings will be worth a lot more .
but is the price the only reason why some artistic works are valuable ?
you must be familiar with this one .
at the end of the world , only a few humans can get the tickets to the No@@ al &apos;s Ar@@ k , but this painting will definitely get on board .
do you know why ?
what is Mona Lisa to the wester@@ ners ?
is it because of the fantastic painting skills that they value it so much ?
or is it because of her mysterious look ?
there is more than that .
personally , I think that the western world today would not be the same if there had not been this painting .
Renaissance actually served as a crow@@ bar in forcing open the iron curtain in the Middle Ages .
our host was right .
do you have desires ?
I believe all people do .
nevertheless , during the entire European history , from the Middle Ages to the 5th century then the end of 14th century , people had to refrain from their desires .
Europeans were not allow to express any natural desires , whether sexual or material .
from then on , some pain@@ ters started to fur@@ tively express their desires through pain@@ t@@ brushes .
for example , R@@ aff@@ a@@ ello portrayed gods as beau@@ ties when gods were the only permissible subject of paintings .
it is recorded in the art history that R@@ aff@@ a@@ ello was a lu@@ st@@ ful painter .
thanks to his &quot; lust , &quot; he human@@ ized gods and revealed natural human desires for sex and beauty in his paintings .
in this work of Da Vinc@@ i , what he painted was just the wife of his neighbour &apos;s , an ordinary person .
but , for a painting like this , with this kind of composition , what was its impact back then ?
let &apos;s think about Chairman Mao &apos;s statue during the Great Cultural Revolution in China .
at that time , the statue stood for dignity and status .
likewise , at that time , paintings were meant for figures like Virgin Mary , roy@@ als like que@@ ens , pop@@ es , aristocr@@ acies or gods .
however , he applied his excellent painting skills to present an ordinary person , just to make it more vivid and real .
from this I grasp two meanings .
first , why ?
he wanted them to stay close to the people .
second , he made painting equal to all human beings .
he showed us with his brushes that he@@ ther you are a king , a pope or an ordinary people , we are all equal before God .
the two meanings contributed to the fundamental concepts of Renaissance : humanism , equality and liberation of humanity .
so , starting from these artists , the iron curtain was finally cracked open .
during the decades after that , people there have been constantly practicing this bel@@ if during every artistic breakthrough and movement .
they advocated that lif@@ es were equal , that everyone had the right to express oneself and to challenge conventional art laws and standards .
why do I have to do this , and why can &apos;t I do that ?
now let &apos;s see this portrait .
actually I was quite familiar with it before I could see it at the Amsterdam Museum in the Netherlands two years ago .
but after I heard the story behind from a researcher there , it struck me that all men of art and people who appreciated and understood art in China should also know the story .
R@@ emb@@ rand@@ t was the most famous and best @-@ selling artist of that time in the Netherlands .
and he could portrayed humans extremely pretty and absolutely lif@@ eli@@ ke .
however , his misfortune started because of this painting .
why ?
a great many wealthy man commissioned him to paint then .
there were some el@@ ites , off@@ springs of the powerful and the wealthy who served as the civic militia guards against pirates . they asked him to paint a group portrait for them .
they asked that all people in a group portrait should be in one row , just like how the seven members of the standing committee came out after the 18th National Congress of the CPC in China , there should be no difference in terms of their position in the picture .
however , R@@ emb@@ rand@@ t didn &apos;t follow this rule .
he invented .
he gave the portrait a story and made it the context of the story , with fore@@ grounds and backgrounds , fluctuations of light and dark and even his wife in it .
his clients were angry with the portrait at the sight of it , saying that R@@ emb@@ rand@@ t must have taken bribes from the people who were in a better position on the painting . so they sued him .
and R@@ emb@@ rand@@ t actually lost the lawsuit .
he went bankrupt for the lawsuit and even did some time .
he could not pay his taxes because no one aked him to paint .
then after a few years , he got his last opportunity .
the town hall needed a big portrait of the founder of the Netherlands , just like the F@@ ounding Ceremony in China .
but no one could handle such a big portrait , so they thought about R@@ emb@@ rand@@ t .
some h@@ esti@@ t@@ ated and said that R@@ emb@@ rand@@ t did not play by the book and hardly followed any instruction .
others thought that R@@ emb@@ rand@@ t was too broke to ruin this opportunity .
finally , they decided on R@@ emb@@ rand@@ t .
then R@@ emb@@ rand@@ t started to paint .
they told him to paint it exactly as the way he was told .
he agreed .
on the opening day of the town hall , when the curtain fell , people saw the portrait and were all astonished .
on the painting were the founder of the Netherlands plotting a rebellion with a gang of bandits .
by the way , the founder of Netherlands was not so handsome as our Chairman Mao was , he had only one eye .
so he was always portrayed in profile and never in front by other pain@@ ters .
for example , if I had something on one cheek , I would only allow the painter to paint a profile painting to hide it .
R@@ emb@@ rand@@ t painted his one eye on purpose and he was with a group of bandits , they looked all dish@@ evel@@ led and ugly .
actually , R@@ emb@@ rand@@ t knew what he was doing .
he thought that was how the Netherlands was built .
so why should people deny this fact ?
as a result , he never got another chance in his remaining years and died in poverty .
however , he still stuck to his ideas and painting style .
in the later period , he gradually changed his style .
his paintings , which had been delicate , became so rough that others deemed them incomplete .
he actually inspired the impres@@ sion@@ ists , we could find his trace in impres@@ sion@@ ist paintings , why is that ?
no pain@@ ters at that time would claim painting for themselves since they had to paint on commissions .
R@@ emb@@ rand@@ t was the first to paint for himself .
through the brush@@ work and colors , he wanted to express his feelings .
when admiring his paintings , you could relate to his emotions and rhyth@@ ms in the process of creating .
all the pain@@ ters I mentioned were ancient wester@@ ners .
in the following hundreds of years , pain@@ ters constantly push art forward .
some even became the hinder for the subsequent pain@@ ters .
the ideas they put up became authority and were then abandoned by the younger generations of artists .
well , who dared to challenge tradition from the Yuan Dynasty till now in China ?
the painting style has never been changed ever since .
it seems that , at present , some Chinese pain@@ ters abandoned the old way and starts to make innovations , the so @-@ called modern art .
but if you have some knowledge of the modern western art and the western art history , you will find it interesting that almost all oil paintings of Chinese author were copying previous works of western pain@@ ters .
if what Chinese artists do were im@@ itating the paintings of ancient Chinese or western artists , then where is our own art ?
if what Chinese artists could do is to drive up the prices on the art market instead of pushing forward the advance of human and national civilization , open@@ ning up our mind , stimulating our imagination and our creativity , if not so , could what they do be called &quot; art &quot; ?
I would rather call that craf@@ ts@@ manship .
in other words , I think that in China , the craf@@ ts@@ manship has replaced the value of art since Yuan .
in disguise of art , it created craft works .
so that is why I said there was no arts after the Song and Yuan dynasties .
I feel reluctant to say so .
I do hope that Chinese artists , apprais@@ ers and art enthusi@@ asts would start from now to make efforts in pushing Chinese arts forward and restore its original nature .
thank You !
thank you !
Charles Dickens once said , &quot; It was the best of times , it was the worst of times . &quot;
you can tell from Jiang Chang@@ jian &apos;s physi@@ que that it &apos;s the worst of times , for the mobility is quite insufficient ; but judging from mine , you can tell that it &apos;s the best of times , for the mobility is rather high .
well , back to Jiang &apos;s question , why is Shanghai ?
to answer this , we have to trace back to 170 years ago .
after the Treaty of Nan@@ king was signed , Shanghai became the second of China &apos;s five trading ports after Xiamen in 18@@ 43 .
since then , Shanghai has developed at high speed .
and it has been 170 years since Shanghai &apos;s opening to the world .
after its opening up , the Great Powers came to Shanghai one after another .
instead of taking it as they did to Hong Kong afterwards , they enclosed lands in Shanghai , which were called concessions .
little by little , concessions became a cultural form and the existence mode of foreigners .
these concessions connected with the development of Shanghai in the 170 years closely .
let &apos;s take a brief look at the two stages of the development of those concessions .
at the first stage , when the foreigners just arrived at Shanghai , do you know what their lives were like ?
at that time , only foreigners were allowed to live in those concessions .
people called it &quot; segregation of foreigners and the Chinese . &quot;
however , till 18@@ 53 and 18@@ 55 , a large number of Chinese refugees s@@ warmed into those concessions due to the insur@@ rec@@ tions of the Small S@@ words Society .
the state of segregation collapsed and the residence of both foreigners and the Chinese could live in the concessions .
therefore , the history of Shanghai was changed , showing three histo@@ ic trends .
first , its economy started to thrive .
second , plenty of Chinese and western cultures were gradually integrated into a whole in those concessions .
the two trends renewed the historic and cultural features in Shanghai , which can be characterized by the following aspects .
first , pursuit of innovation .
because it accepted the influence from the western world .
second , assimil@@ ation of western cultures .
third , mer@@ can@@ til@@ ism , for Shanghai attached much importance to commerce .
fourth , praise of common customs .
Shanghai &apos;s culture is one for the citizens on the whole .
it is also very popular and down @-@ to @-@ earth .
that was why men of letters of the Peking School represented by Shen Con@@ g@@ wen called its culture as Shanghai @-@ style culture .
today we use &quot; Shanghai @-@ style culture &quot; as a commend@@ atory term .
but at that time , it was a derog@@ atory term .
this was how Shanghai &apos;s culture tended to be .
as a result of such historic characteristics , Shanghai &apos;s management form was also unique , which was called &quot; country in a country . &quot;
to be specific , foreigners were mainly in charge of those regions , with a large number of Chinese people living there . however , the Chinese government had no control over the regions . isn &apos;t this interesting ?
so the concessions became a grey zone out of control .
so you could find all kinds of people there .
for example , ad@@ he@@ rents of the previous dynasty such as Xu Hong@@ ji , Z@@ eng Chun@@ xian and Zheng Xia@@ ox@@ u ,
Kang You@@ wei , a member of a revolutionary party wanted by the Em@@ press Dow@@ ager Ci@@ xi , and Z@@ ou R@@ ong and Zhang Tai@@ yan , whose articles caused shock at home and abroad .
the New Youth by Chen Du@@ xi@@ u was also founded in Shanghai .
but its headquarters were moved to Beijing when Chen was appointed Chairman of the Chinese Literature Department at the invitation of Cai Yuan@@ pei .
the magazine triggered the May Fourth Movement and the subsequent New Culture Movement .
besides , the First National Congress of the CPC was held in the French Conc@@ ession of the Lu@@ wan District in Shanghai .
mayor Zhou is also present today .
he was a leader of the Lu@@ wan District at that time .
think this , in the French Conc@@ ession , you can find various political factions and political powers .
meanwhile , all kinds of cultural thoughts and arts began to develop rapidly , which was a trend at that time .
Lin Ming@@ jie just gave a speech on art .
he is specialized in commenting painting and calligraphy .
I &apos;d also like to share with you an example of Shanghai School painting .
in the past , you must come to Shanghai if you want to make some achievements or money in painting .
of the &quot; Big Three &quot; of Shanghai @-@ style painting , only Xu Gu was from Shanghai .
Wu Chang@@ shu@@ o was from Hu@@ zhou and Ren Bon@@ ian was from Shan@@ yin County of Sha@@ ox@@ ing City .
Wu Chang@@ shu@@ o spent his later years in Suzhou .
although he wanted to sell his paintings in Shanghai , he dared not come without discretion , for he considered Shanghai to be the paradise for advent@@ u@@ rers .
so he entrust the undertaking to one of his students , Zhao Yun@@ he , to take the first step .
sure enough , Zhao Yun@@ he made large profits there in just a year .
today , Zhao &apos;s paintings can still be seen at many auction shops .
they are just pot@@ bo@@ ilers , so to speak , and far from his teacher &apos;s in quality .
we can also see from Wu Hu@@ fan &apos;s diary , in which he had low opinions of Zhao .
Wu Chang@@ shu@@ o was surprised that Zhao could make so much money with his l@@ ack@@ luster paintings .
so , at the generous invitation of Wang Y@@ iting , the general agent of N@@ iss@@ in Company then , Wu moved to Shanghai , and thus starting to make contributions to the development of Shanghai School painting together with Ren Bon@@ ian and Xu Gu .
well , put it this way , there wouldn &apos;t be so many prominent artists such as Wu Chang@@ shu@@ o , Ren Bon@@ ian , Zhang Da@@ q@@ ian and Liu Ha@@ is@@ u but for Shanghai .
people keep discussing where the origin of China &apos;s oil painting is ？
it &apos;s actually Shanghai .
but why is it ?
after its opening up , a lot of foreign missi@@ onaries came to the Xu@@ ji@@ a@@ hui Catholic Church in Shanghai .
and later , the missi@@ onaries in the church set up the T &apos;@@ ou @-@ S@@ e @-@ We Museum , which is now generally accepted as the cradle of China &apos;s painting .
though having a good name , the Museum was actually an orphan@@ age .
to ensure that the wretched and homeless orphans could learn professional skills and re@@ join the society , the missi@@ onaries from various European countries inspired children with art , on which they could survive when they left the orphan@@ age .
as we know today , some of the artists from there loved the common people a lot , like Zhang Ch@@ on@@ gre@@ n , the well @-@ known sculp@@ tor .
Zhang Ch@@ on@@ gre@@ n is the only Chinese artist well remembered in Europe as the best friend of Ryan , the creator of The Ad@@ ventures of Tin@@ tin .
some even said that the image of Tin@@ tin was drawn from Zhang .
in the late years , he was deemed a master in France .
he created sculptures for Mit@@ terr@@ and and De@@ bus@@ sy .
and that was why , as people said , he had free access to the é@@ lys@@ é@@ e Palace .
another artist from the orphan@@ age is Zhou Xiang , the teacher of Liu Ha@@ is@@ u .
if it weren &apos;t for Liu Xiang , there wouldn &apos;t be such an artist as Liu Ha@@ is@@ u , and the education of China &apos;s oil painting initiated by Liu wouldn &apos;t exist either .
the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts founded by Liu was the first in China to practice human body sketch .
at that time , it was incredible for a girl to serve as a nude model under the gaze of many male students .
but Shanghai offered an open and generous mind for China &apos;s paintings , especially for oil paintings , to secure long @-@ term and sustainable development .
now let &apos;s divert our attention to Peking Opera .
in Beijing , when going to a theatre , the Shanghai people would call it watching an opera , but the Beijing people would rather call it listening to an opera , for they only put emphasis on what they hear .
however , when Peking Opera spread to Shanghai , it took on the local features and became the so @-@ called Shanghai @-@ style Peking Opera , which focused on both audio and visual contents .
for example , there was an artist who was deemed the representative of Peking Opera .
but I could say that had it not been for Shanghai , he wouldn &apos;t have achieved considerable success as an artist and exerted such great influences on people who love Peking Opera from his times till now .
the artist is Mei Lan@@ fang .
in 19@@ 14 , when he was 20 years old , he came to Shanghai for the first time .
at that time , he was just an ordinary opera actor of Dan role ( female role ) unknown to the Shanghai community .
so he was not a supporting actor then .
the leading actor was a Sheng role actor named Wang Feng@@ qing .
you can tell the difference from their wages .
the wage of Wang Feng@@ qing for 45 days of performance was 3@@ 800 silver dollars , but merely 14@@ 00 silver dollars for Mei Lan@@ fang .
and it was only at the repeated requests of Wang , Mei &apos;s wage was raised to about 18@@ 00 silver dollars .
however , when Mei came to Shanghai again , he became the leading role , with a wage of about four thousand to five thousand silver dollars , while Wang &apos;s had been cut in half .
actually , Mei &apos;s first performance in Shanghai in 19@@ 14 was very important , even for his entire life .
on one hand , he found the stage here was splendid and much brighter than those in Beijing , though not very big .
why ?
several bright bulbs were lined at the front edge of the stage , which might be neon lights or LED today .
that was a novelty for him , and he thought the setting to be gorgeous .
and it was the first time for him to see follow spotlight on the stage of Peking Opera in Shanghai .
you can see that there are also many on this stage .
at that time , the opera stages in Beijing had no such things .
on the other hand , he also found that actors of Dan role in Shanghai looked more beautiful than those in Beijing .
through careful observation he puzzled out the reason , eyes@@ ha@@ dow .
Beijing actors were lightly made @-@ up at their eyes , so that their eyes didn &apos;t look big and bright enough on the stage .
meanwhile , Shanghai actors had heavy eyes@@ ha@@ dow , so their eyes with heavy dark circles looked much brighter and bigger under the spotlight .
when he asked about it , people said that Shanghai actors of Dan role drew much helpful experience from the Hollywood films .
apart from eyes@@ ha@@ dow , we know that Peking Opera actors use fake hair .
back at that time , Beijing actors often paste fake hair in a square shape , which made their face shorter and not pretty enough .
but he found that the way Shanghai actors did it was different .
in the following forty years of performance , Mr. Mei summarized the tips to paste fake hair .
Shanghai people did it in quite brilliant ways .
ways to paste fake hair depended on actors &apos; face features . do you know it ?
for actors with slim faces , fake hair should be p@@ asted backward to make their faces look bigger .
Jiang Chang@@ jian is of such a kind .
for actors with plump faces like me , fake hair should be p@@ asted forward , almost on this area .
for short faces , it should be p@@ asted higher , and the fake hair itself should be shorter .
and for long faces , it should be p@@ asted lower .
the ways of p@@ asting fake hair were fairly inspiring for Mei .
therefore , the Mei School Art he created afterwards , as well as his gent@@ leness , elegance and generosity on the stage were attributable to his staying in Shanghai and learning from the actors of Shanghai @-@ style Peking Opera .
those were all that lied on the surface .
do you know what more important thing was ?
it was in Shanghai that he learnt the innovation spirit , which enlightened and astonished Mei a lot .
after returning Beijing , Mei did a lot of work with his fellow actors , and together they rehear@@ sed plenty of new operas such as Yi L@@ v Ma and Deng Xia Gu .
innovation was an important thing throughout Mei &apos;s entire life as an artist , so to speak .
in his remaining years , the last opera he rehear@@ sed , Lady General Mu T@@ akes Command , became the most representative one of his eight prominent operas .
the opera was originally a Yu Opera from Henan Province , and Mei borrowed it from Ma J@@ inf@@ eng , a master of Yu Opera .
so I can say that if it weren &apos;t for Shanghai , Mei wouldn &apos;t become a master of Peking Opera .
what impress us most on the streets of Shanghai today are definitely those world architecture groups in the Bun@@ d .
of those architecture groups is a style called art dec@@ o .
it lasted no more than 20 years in Europe .
except Cz@@ ec@@ hos@@ lov@@ akia , Shanghai boasts the largest amount of art dec@@ o buildings in the world .
Shanghai is so captiv@@ ating . that &apos;s why L@@ as@@ z@@ lo@@ .@@ Hu@@ de@@ c , a wan@@ derer , could fit into this city .
besides , it is also too numerous to mention Shanghai &apos;s movies , dramas and pop songs .
the city is always a smel@@ ter that can take in literature , drama , music and other art forms .
all these factors ensure that Shanghai will continue to be the spotlight of the world .
during the 170 years , Shanghai has developed from a small coastal county into a magical city that draws worldwide attention .
we can conduct studies on its development course to find the reason .
I remember a comment of Shanghai by The Times that Shanghai is the darling of the times and the mixture of history .
this can also explain why ideas , artists and artistic atmosphere are diversified in Shanghai .
well , now you must know the answer to the question , why is Shanghai ?
thank you !
today I &apos;d like to talk about the story of children , especially the way my daughter and I traveled .
six years ago , lots of people traveled this route , including many of my friends .
but no child had ever taken it , so it occurred to me that I wanted to take my daughter with me , as she liked to follow me everywhere when she was very little .
back then she was ten , so I decided to show her the G@@ ob@@ i Desert .
in the G@@ ob@@ i , we needed to cover a route of 12@@ 0@@ km within 4 days .
basically the terrain looked like this : very bu@@ mp@@ y .
and this place is famous for its wind , nick@@ named as &quot; the most windy area in the world . &quot;
if you pay a visit there now , you will find it has the largest wind farm in Asia .
why ?
because of its strong wind .
this meant we needed to walk in the wind .
during the first three days , I would walk with grown @-@ ups in the team while my daughter walked with her mother .
then on the third night , my daughter told me , &quot; Dad , I feel very frustrated . &quot;
the word &quot; frustrated &quot; she used left a lasting impression on me .
she was only ten , so I wondered how could such a little girl feel frustrated ?
so I talked with her , &quot; Why ? why do you feel frustrated ? &quot;
she said , &quot; I don &apos;t want to be the last in the team , but I am every day . &quot;
I said , &quot; It &apos;s reasonable , there are only two children in this team , and you are the younger one . &quot;
&quot; but I hate the feeling of being last , &quot; my daughter said .
&quot; then I will accompany you tomorrow , we will try to walk as fast as we can , and we won &apos;t be last . &quot;
she felt excited and said &quot; Okay . &quot;
I was the last to begin , however , that day due to some unexpected problems .
looking at my daughter , her expression suggested something was wrong , so I asked , &quot; What &apos;s wrong , Fei ? &quot;
&quot; dad , I don &apos;t trust you anymore , &quot; she answered .
well , that sounded serious , so I asked why .
she complained , &quot; In the previous days when I walked with mom , I started as early as possible , and I kept in the middle of the team , but still ended up last ; now you promised to take me with you and promised me I will not be last any more , but that has already happened . &quot;
we &apos;ve lost the day &apos;s walk even though we haven &apos;t started yet .
when it came to her trust in me , I felt I had to treat the matter seriously .
so I made up my mind and told her , &quot; No matter what happens today , we will not be last , and we &apos;ll at least try to be second to last . &quot;
I explained to her , &quot; Well , today our trick is to &apos; walk slowly but never stop . &quot; I believe as long as we keep walking and take no rests when others do , we will certainly not be the last . &quot;
then we started , my daughter following with uncertainty in her mind .
later I decided that we would rest for 5 minutes after an hour &apos;s walk , and then continued to walk on and on .
much to my surprise , we were almost at the middle of the team when we had covered half of the route .
then we and the team took breaks successively , and after a while my daughter said to me , &quot; Dad , let &apos;s go . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t be hasty , we have already caught up , so there &apos;s nothing to be worried about , &quot; I replied .
&quot; no , I cannot walk quickly enough , so if we rest longer , I am afraid I won &apos;t be able to catch up , &quot; she insisted .
then I realized that she really cared about this , so we marched on .
this is a picture taken by someone else when we almost arrived at the terminal point , where we found that we were among the first half of the team to make it to the destination .
my daughter and I were very satisfied that day .
at supper , we ate at the same table , and she sat opposite of me .
around us were several team members , all grown @-@ ups .
&quot; I could not make it to the end today without my daughter , &quot; I said .
then my daughter said to me without even raising her head , &quot; Ac@@ tually I made it all because of my dad . &quot;
I can tell you now , what I felt at that moment was like hearing the collapsing of the wall in my heart .
from that day on , I felt that there were no more misunderstandings between me and my daughter .
perhaps I still won &apos;t have much to say when we are together the next time .
but I reckon when people keep silent being together , odds are that either they feel awkward , don &apos;t know what to say , or they feel delighted and don &apos;t feel the need to express it .
I believe we were the latter .
this episode may have just been progress in our parent @-@ child relationship .
but I think it was a memorable experience , because it led to something valuable three years later after the walk .
when we came back from the G@@ ob@@ i , I told my daughter that it was very rewarding to walk with her .
it strengthened our bond and gave me an opportunity to know more about her .
I said in the future I &apos;d like to hold a coming @-@ of @-@ age ceremony in the G@@ ob@@ i Desert , in which parents are expected to walk with their children along this route .
three years later we did hold one - the first coming @-@ of @-@ age ceremony in the G@@ ob@@ i Desert .
we expected to receive at least fifty children and their parents , with more than a hundred people in total .
when my daughter heard the news , she insisted that she come too .
she was already fourteen then .
I must attend , she said .
&quot; well , then come and join us , &quot; I told her .
I was curious about her intentions , however .
walking in the G@@ ob@@ i Desert , in my opinion , is a rather painful experience .
then four days later - four arduous days - all of the children shared their experiences with us , including my daughter , and what she shared was very touching to her mother and me .
she said , &quot; Ac@@ tually this time my walking in the G@@ ob@@ i Desert is a gift that I am going to present to my parents &quot;
&quot; when I first came here three years ago , my dad told me that he would hold a coming @-@ of @-@ age ceremony here . &quot;
&quot; three years passed , and now we have more than fifty children with us . &quot;
&quot; Wenchuan suffered a catastrophic quake two years ago , &quot; she continued , &quot; and my parents intended to organize a voluntary relief team when they watched the news with tears in their eyes . &quot;
&quot; now it &apos;s already two years since the foundation of this voluntary team . &quot;
&quot; one year ago , &quot; she said , &quot; my parents talked about a 10@@ km run for health concerns , so they called up their friends and then went jogging 10@@ km every week . &quot;
&quot; a few days ago , we just celebrated the first anniversary of this running initiative . &quot;
&quot; although we are together every day , I find my parents are quite busy , and they let me do whatever I want . &quot;
this was a complaint .
&quot; now I finally realize what they were busy doing and that they will always keep their word . &quot;
I felt moved ; then it struck me that although our child is silent and rarely talks , she is always watching us .
our school advocates the motto of , &quot; B@@ eli@@ ef , Action and Per@@ sist@@ ence . &quot;
I can find no better case to practice this motto than walking in the G@@ ob@@ i Desert together with your child , or fulfilling a tough task together and making a promise to her and keeping your word .
despite that it &apos;s already been three years , I &apos;d like to say to my daughter that we will continue to do those three things we promised , and see them become better and better . &quot;
I also believe that in the future my daughter can properly put into practice the motto of , &quot; B@@ eli@@ ef , Action and Per@@ sist@@ ence . &quot;
that &apos;s the first thing I want to share with you .
in fact , children always surprise us in one way or another .
here is a question for you .
among our wal@@ kers who had been to the Ge@@ bi , we have kids from seven and a half years , the youngest , to eighteen , young people in their tw@@ enties , and people above forty .
are we middle aged ?
I prefer to say that we are still young .
so which age group do you think was most likely to cover the entire route without a ride ?
which one ?
the middle aged ?
kids ?
yes , it was them .
when I raise this question , you may suppose that young men would definitely have the most satisfying performance .
I found during my first walk , however , that less young men in their tw@@ enties could make it than those in their for@@ ties .
I thought maybe this was because those in their for@@ ties have experienced a lot in their lives , so they could bear more pressure and suffering and hold on to the end .
I came across a strange phenomenon in our first coming @-@ of @-@ age ceremony - the one attended by my daughter .
at the end of the first day &apos;s journey , the guide told me , &quot; It &apos;s very strange , I have walked this route so many times , yet this is the only day that all the members walked to the end without taking a ride . I guess we have set a record . &quot;
that day the children walked with their parents .
and it was to our great surprise that all of the children were so persistent .
on the following two days , those children walked by themselves .
and when the second day came to an end , our guide told me just like he did the last time , &quot; All the children walked to the end , and no one took rides , except for their parents . &quot;
it was easier to figure out why parents took rides , maybe because they wanted to arrive early and put up tents for their children .
this was totally acceptable .
I couldn &apos;t see the reason why the children didn &apos;t take rides .
later I realized that children recover from fatigue very quickly .
some of them would cry due to the long journey , but shortly after arriving at the camp , they would become playful again .
so I thought it &apos;s no wonder that they didn &apos;t take rides .
on the third day , a child took a ride due to physical reasons , and a girl attended to her .
that night , the children sat together to share their stories , and the one who took a ride said , &quot; To tell you the truth , today I met a member who felt uncomfortable , so she got in the car , and I also felt very tired . so I said to myself why not get on , too ? &quot;
then I heard the crowd respond in astonishment , &quot; Hu@@ h ? we can ride that car ? &quot;
all of a sudden , I realized that they didn &apos;t even know that they could get in the car .
I also found out why these three categories performed as they did .
for the children , they didn &apos;t ride the car because they didn &apos;t know that they could .
they thought that the only choice for them was to walk to the end .
as for those in their for@@ ties , they might have conceded that they have lived nearly half of their lives , and with few choices left , this was it - walk to the end and finally achieve something .
or , if not , yield to fate .
so they were unwilling to try other choices .
only those who were young in their tw@@ enties and freshly graduated from university had many chances before them .
we , on the other hand , have fewer opportunities , so all we can do is to mind each step on the path we have chosen .
this is the inspiration I got from the children .
you may also believe that they can do better with fewer choices .
on the contrary , they are offered too many choices , and any choice that is not made or fulfilled by themselves is not a good one at all .
the third story I &apos;d like to share is that during the walk , a teenager of about thirteen told us that after the journey he realized that pain makes his existence more real .
it &apos;s astonishing that such a young child can draw such a philosophical conclusion .
he didn &apos;t receive any professional training , so how could he speak such profound words ?
when I was young , I always thought that children are a gift from Heaven , and that god will often deliver messages to us through our children .
nowadays , we are re@@ thinking to define what &quot; thinking &quot; is .
does everyone recognize this character ?
yes , it reads &quot; si , &quot; and it &apos;s the earliest written form that we can find .
look at the upper part , does it look like a head ?
actually , this part reads &quot; xin , &quot; referring to the fon@@ tan@@ el , or the soft , bon@@ eless area of a baby &apos;s skull .
what &apos;s the lower part ?
&quot; Xin , &quot; known as heart today .
our ancestors believed that thinking was the product of the head and the heart .
the head alone cannot think , and we can see in Chinese writing that any character den@@ oting thought has a &quot; heart &quot; component .
thinking is not independent of the heart ; and without the heart , thinking is not genuine .
well , imagine how can a student score highly in a math contest ?
must he use his heart or his head ?
the results of the College En@@ trance Ex@@ am were released lately .
is it a test of the head or the heart ?
what is education like in our schools ?
is it about the head or the heart ?
if you hope that your child can be a true grown @-@ up in the future , then travel with him , face challenges with him , and solve problems with him .
only then can you truly know your child and help him to be a fully developed person .
to be honest , I had a sweet encounter today .
my daughter went traveling with her classmates after graduating from high school , and I don &apos;t know where they went until today when I arrived at Shanghai and discovered that she is here , too .
so I invited my daughter , right there , Fei .
in fact , I brought a gift for her .
it &apos;s a video we recorded three years ago when we went traveling in the G@@ ob@@ i Desert .
now I &apos;d like to watch it with you .
by playing this video , I want to tell my daughter that this trip is not truly a graduation trip , as you will have far more meaningful trips in the future while expanding your horizons .
we are not likely to have an encounter like this , however , when you &apos;re in the wider world .
but no matter what chance we have , no matter how far you go , you will always receive love and blessings from your mother and me , just as the song in this video will accompany you forever .
thank you all !
let me first tell you a story , a true story .
one day in last May , there was a set of photos posted on S@@ ina Wei@@ bo .
I don &apos;t know if you can see clearly what is the people in the photos doing ?
the original post has been deleted by the author , so I managed to cut off such a set of photos from the newspaper to show you this is a true story .
it doesn &apos;t matter if you can see it clearly .
there is a paragraph below .
the students of Zhong@@ bei Campus of East China Normal University should have heard about the evidence of the s@@ will @-@ cooked dirty oil in the vicinity of the H@@ edong Can@@ teen News@@ stand .
we didn &apos;t know what the oil was used for , or where did they go .
in less than an hour , follow @-@ up posts and comments , including doubts , queries and conclusions , flooded S@@ ina Wei@@ bo .
it was concluded that a 9@@ 85 university was using the s@@ will @-@ cooked dirty oil , which was horri@@ fying .
when I saw this Wei@@ bo post as well as the comments and follow @-@ up posts triggered by it , I felt shocked and couldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s true , but I immediately realized that this was a trust crisis and must be dealt with seriously .
so I called the head of the logistics department of the university to ask him to investigate the event as soon as possible , and keep me updated .
the result came out soon .
the people in the photos was , as a matter of fact , dred@@ ging the sew@@ ers , which was a regular task .
so I immediately sent out a Wei@@ bo post , telling the students who the people on the photos was , what he was doing and why , as well as how this matter was dealt with .
at the same time , I also sent a second Wei@@ bo post on the Internet to disclose the disposal specification of waste edible oil and fat from the canteen that was sent to me by our logistics department , to explain to the students .
in response to questions from some students about the source of oil in our canteen , I sent a third Wei@@ bo post to tell them where our oil came from .
the facts were clarified within a few hours .
the students not only knew the truth of the event , but also eliminated doubts .
more importantly , they experienced a process of rational thinking .
within a few hours in the afternoon , the whole public opinion on Wei@@ bo was becoming positive , with people highly recognizing the timely communication and active interaction between the university and the students , and expressing their trust , love and support for the university .
I think anyone who sees such a result will be excited .
I still feel very excited even now .
from this story , I believe , we may learn a lot of useful lessons .
someone once asked me , you have been the president of three different universities , namely , Shanghai Normal University , East China Normal University and currently New York University Shanghai , and in your view , what is the most important job of a president ?
you all know the main task of the president of an American university is to fight for school funding as well as outstanding talents .
you may also know that the president of a Chinese university has to manage everything as he / she is responsible for every project in the university .
however , if I &apos;m allowed to summarize the work of a university president with the most concise words , I will say two words , think and communicate .
there are several traditional means of communication , including convening meetings , to convey spirits and arrange tasks , which is a top @-@ down way of communication ; organizing sym@@ posi@@ ums and consultation meetings , which is a bottom @-@ up way of communication ; and having heart @-@ to @-@ heart talks to encourage democratic activities , which is interactive communication .
it is my hope to establish a bridge for communication between the university and students .
I recall that ten years ago , when I was the president of Shanghai Normal University , we would hire a group of students each year as assistants to president .
we hope through these assistants , we can build a bridge for communication between the university and the students to facilitate mutual understanding and communication .
one of my assistants was the moder@@ ator of the university B@@ BS .
he suggested me to set up a President Online on the B@@ BS to directly communicate with the students , which gave me a great joy thanks to the direct communication with students .
in 2006 , I returned to East China Normal University to serve as the president .
a well @-@ meaning student signed up on the Ren@@ ren@@ .com with my real name and a cartoon av@@ atar of me which was quite handsome .
he represented me to communicate with students online .
one student told me : &quot; President Yu , we have been talking &quot;
I asked , &quot; Where ? &quot;
&quot; on Ren@@ ren . &quot;
what is Ren@@ ren ?
with the question in mind , I opened Ren@@ ren .
there was indeed a Yu Liz@@ hong , communicating with the students with smiles .
though it &apos;s not me , I saw the influence and effect of such a way of communication .
in fact , I think the student who communicated with students in my place actually did a decent job , so I think everyone can make a good president .
out of this reason , I officially signed up on Ren@@ ren@@ .com , and finally managed to apply a public homepage of Ren@@ ren .
over the years I have used this homepage to post a lot of information , listened to the opinions of many students , and utilized this platform to conduct pretty much meaningful communication with teachers and students .
last year , the students told me I was outdated , so I registered a VIP account on S@@ ina Wei@@ bo .
I want to tell you that I now have more than 1.6 million followers .
my account is verified with real name , so you all are welcome to follow me .
this is not an advertisement .
I don &apos;t really care about whether or not I have 1.6 million followers .
I really feel that this platform serves as a good window for me to make friends from all walks of life , and also gives me a great opportunity to hear different voices and also be able to send out my ideas and the voice of our university to the public , including many of our students and alumni .
from B@@ BS to Ren@@ ren and Wei@@ bo , and to We@@ Chat now ,
I am advancing with the times and indeed following the preferences of the digital natives , because I want to blend in on their social platforms .
as a matter of fact , there was a time when I would sit at the computer every night after eleven or even twelve o &apos;clock , just to read the various kinds of information t@@ wee@@ ted by students on Ren@@ ren and Wei@@ bo .
from the information , I spotted a lot of problems concerning university management .
the leaders of many departments of China Normal University were harass@@ ed by me through phone at night .
when I saw a problem , I would make a phone call to tell them what this was about , and the next day they would be very busy dealing with the problem .
such a direct response to university management is needed and welcomed by students .
I think such means of communication is completely necessary either for the university management and development or for strengthened cohesion between the faculty and students .
recently , there have been wide coverage in the media about the installation of air condi@@ tioners in student dormit@@ ories .
in fact , two years ago , East China Normal University also faced such situation .
our new campus has air condi@@ tioners installed in all student dormit@@ ories at the early stage of the construction , which I believe is the first university to do so in Shanghai .
our old campus , unfortunately , has no air conditioning due to power supply and funding problems .
more than two years ago , our students expressed their voices to install air condi@@ tioners as students in some other colleges and universities do today .
what should we do ?
how should school leaders face such a request from students ?
the first thing we thought is to explain to the students why the campus has not installed air conditioner .
in addition to money issue , power supply and mechanism also were obstacles .
but if we didn &apos;t tell the students the truth , maybe we would hear a different voice on the Internet .
so we chose to be honest with students and we also welcomed them to offer their suggestions to solve the problems .
a lot of suggestions came in , which were very inspiring .
during such a kind of interactive communication process , we gradually formed our own ideas and plans .
on one hand , we tried to raise money to have the power transformation and supply capacity improved .
we arranged wiring in all dormit@@ ories in the campus .
on the other , we adopted a new mechanism for students to lease air @-@ condi@@ tioners to solve the problem of fund shortage .
most of the students agreed with this approach , because the most important thing for them was to have air @-@ conditioning as soon as possible .
we made it and we made it two years ago .
I feel such an interactive platform , such a communication mechanism do help the university and have indeed solved many difficulties and conflicts .
once on the B@@ BS &quot; President Online , one student expressed her criticism of the arrangement of an event organized by the university in a very intense language .
I tried to explain to her a little , but only trigger greater dissatisfaction .
frustrated , I asked her if we could arrange a meeting so I could listen to her opinion in person .
our meeting turned out to be very enjoyable .
standing in front of me was a very rational and thoughtful girl , not a young cy@@ nic at all and a total different figure from what I felt on the Internet .
through a very frank conversation , she understood the original intention of the university to organize this event , and I also realized that our poor arrangement and insufficient explanation caused many misunderstandings and negative emotions among the students .
what was very interesting was that she apologized to me immediately as we met .
she said that the reason why she was so out@@ spoken was that she felt she could be un@@ restrained on the Internet , and asked me not to take it personally .
in fact , there are several similar experiences in my life .
as the student mentioned , surfing the Internet is to enjoy an equal feeling .
everyone is the same .
we must maintain a good attitude with tolerance , and gather positive energy with positive , equal and sincere communication .
since there is no context in communication online , the ambiguity of discourse is easy to cause ridiculous misunderstandings , and we should learn to use such words as &quot; ho @-@ ho &quot; and &quot; ha @-@ ha &quot; to create a relaxed atmosphere .
if you browse my Wei@@ bo , there will always be &quot; ho @-@ ho &quot; and &quot; ha @-@ ha &quot; in the beginning of almost every post .
maybe this kind of expression is somewhat naughty , but everyone seems to like it .
in the Internet , we can &apos;t see the expression of the authors .
for this reason , we &apos;d better learn to use cute emo@@ j@@ is like smile , laugh , and applaud , to show your sense of humor , express your friendly attitude , and let your friends have a good mood .
this is what I have learned through surfing the Internet over the years .
finally , I &apos;d like remind all of you don &apos;t be addicted to the Internet , and this is possible if you spend too much time on Wei@@ bo .
thank you all !
hello , everyone !
you must have known from my baggage that I &apos;m a travel enthusi@@ ast .
yes , I am a travel enthusi@@ ast , who just came back from a long @-@ time travel .
EM@@ M , just let me take off my bag .
ha@@ ha@@ ha , just leave it .
it &apos;s ok to speak with that on my back .
I &apos;ve worn it for more than a decade .
today , I want to share my own story .
it &apos;s about ideas and the power of ideas .
actually this is a sudden flash of idea .
I think about the idea , carry it out and finally realize it step by step , this dream .
at the end of 1987 , I began collecting stamps .
at that time , China Post issued a set of stamps to commemorate the 4@@ 00@@ th anniversary of Xu Xi@@ ake , a travel writer and ge@@ ographer in the Ming Dynasty .
until that moment , I had never heard of this traveler in the Ming Dynasty .
I was too ignorant at that time .
really , I had a limited range of reading and I dropped out of school after three and a half years of education in elementary school .
because I had to look after my ailing parents who later passed away .
the night I saw these stamps , it occurred to me that I should also be a traveler .
and this idea inspired me to make preparations .
the first thing is money .
I had to make money .
so on week@@ days , I worked .
actually I did all kinds of jobs , except illegal ones .
in my spare time , it &apos;s not easy to venture out .
so I had to do exercises .
I learned some basic martial arts , such as Ying Qi Gong and Chinese boxing .
these simple techniques helped me a lot in my travel .
my three and a half years of education taught me nothing about reading a map .
since it was the Cultural Revolution , children in rural areas only stayed in school for a short period of time .
I either took care of my ailing parents at home or did labor works at school .
so in my spare time , I would make preparations for my travel .
for example , I read books about Chinese geography and folk@@ lore .
when I came across difficult things , I would hum@@ bly consult others and I learned a lot from people around me .
the preparation lasted 10 years .
in October , 1998 , I felt I was ready and I planned to start my adventure .
before I set off , I sold my house because I didn &apos;t want to leave myself with any choices of coming back home if I were in difficulties .
but I have to tell you , I wasn &apos;t married at that time .
since I planned to venture out , getting married would mean ir@@ responsibility .
EM@@ M , indeed , there were some people wanting to marry me .
I sold my house and a huge box of stamps collected over years .
well , come to think of it , I nearly cried when I sold the stamps .
to collect a set of stamps , I once took the train from Harbin to Shanghai and then to Guangzhou just to buy them .
actually the stamps were not as expensive as the train tickets .
but years later , I just sold them .
as part of my preparation , I had to build my body strength and I got into the daily routine of running five to ten kilometers with weight vest , against all odds .
and I had my appendix removed before I left , because I feared constant camping outside would cause append@@ ic@@ itis .
so I went to the hospital and told the doctor I wanted to have my appendix removed before my nationwide hiking .
he said , &quot; Are you insane ? &quot;
I responded , &quot; I &apos;m perfectly normal . just remove it . &quot;
everything was ready .
on 20 October , 1998 , just a bit over 8 : 18 , I began my journey from National Highway 102 of Harbin because it is my hometown .
why did I choose this day ?
because in rural China , we normally select a suitable date for going out , building a house , getting married or holding fun@@ er@@ als .
the day I began my adventure was the first day of September according to the Chinese Lunar Cal@@ end@@ ar , &apos; September &apos; for nine and &apos; the first day &apos; for one , meaning back to the original point .
to put it another way , it symbolizes that I could come back home safe and sound .
I planned to travel through all China in ten years .
so since the first day , I have worn this bu@@ zz@@ cut and I &apos;ve never have my hair cut ever since .
let me show you some statistics .
I hi@@ ked for ten years and 20 days , carrying at least 30 kil@@ os of items and sometimes even up to 45 kil@@ os .
if there was more weight , I would use a bar@@ row and wheeled it from Xinjiang to Heilongjiang province , climbing over mountains .
the items could be up to 8@@ 5@@ kg to 90@@ kg .
when the bar@@ row was stuck in the G@@ ob@@ i desert , I walked carrying it on my shoulder .
my entire journey covers 8@@ 1,000 kilometers , an equivalent of a trip travelling the equator for two rounds .
thank you !
during that time , I was robbed 19 times but I fought off the robbers or scared them away for at least 10 times .
once there were three robbers . they were very young but fortunately they were not strong .
some of them came out under the arch of the bridge and the rest from the forest , chasing me with little d@@ ag@@ gers and wooden sticks .
during my journey , I kept a tri@@ pod with a long knife tucked in it .
when I stopped for rest , I would sharpen the knife with sands , so it was quite polished .
at that time , my hair was nearly one meter long .
when I saw the robbers coming to me , I took out the knife and rushed toward them , saying &apos; Finally , I saw someone &apos; .
at last , they were scared away .
in the ten years , I wore out 52 pairs of shoes , lost 19 toe nails and had 233 blist@@ ers and blood blist@@ ers on my feet .
what &apos;s more , I wrote a diary of more than one million words , took over 40,000 photos and collected more than two tons of materials .
now , all these things appear in my personal exhibition in a military training base at the Chang@@ ping District of Beijing .
on my way , I came across beasts for more than 40 times .
although China covers an area of 9.@@ 6 million square kilometers , I have had zero contact with nearly all kinds of beasts , except wild tigers .
there were two times when I nearly got killed .
one occurred in Lu@@ ox@@ i@@ ao Mountain spanning the two provinces of Jiangxi and Hunan , where I was chased by a py@@ th@@ on over 150 kil@@ os .
at first the py@@ th@@ on was tens of meters away , but finally it came to as close as less than 10 meters away from me even though I had run for my life fast enough to cough up blood .
since it was an un@@ inhabited area , I managed to run away by setting off cr@@ ackers and spraying the aerosol pesticide .
the other happened in an un@@ inhabited area with an altitude of more than 4,@@ 700 meters in N@@ gar@@ i Prefecture , Tibet .
it was mid @-@ night and I stayed in the tent .
however , my tent was surrounded by more than 20 wolves .
after more than 40 minutes , I drove off the wolves by burning three clothes and setting off firecr@@ ackers and spraying the aerosol pesticide .
I was so frightened that I did not sleep at all that night .
at that time , I wrote a letter of twenty to thirty words to my sister .
I felt I was going to die , but I realized that if I could live for one more minute , I should maintain hopes and fight with the wolves .
thank you !
this is the col@@ dest place , -@@ 53 degrees , I &apos;ve been to during my trip . look at the upper left picture , this is the border between China and Russia .
and the hottest place is the Tur@@ pan Basin in Xinjiang , with a surface temperature of 74 degrees .
I nearly became a mummy there .
but the theme is the same .
just inspired by one idea and one belief , I want to accomplish one thing .
I have not read thousands of books , so I want to enrich my life by walking thousands of miles .
there were times when I had nothing to eat .
in the Shen@@ n@@ ong@@ jia Natural Reserve , I ate the leaves and the roots of plants for a few days .
and I even caught a two @-@ meter snake and ate it without cooking .
I pe@@ eled the skin , sprink@@ led some salt , and sliced meat with the blade .
but when I put the sliced meat into my mouth , it still leaped .
I thought that I was very cruel .
I am an environmental volunteer , and my journey focuses on three themes : environmental protection , folk@@ lore and adventure .
I wanted to explore all the ethnic groups and un@@ inhabited areas in China .
I wanted to get acquainted with the environments in China that are both severely damaged and un@@ spo@@ ilt .
what &apos;s I have done in the past decade .
however , I was quite helpless in un@@ inhabited areas .
in some pri@@ m@@ eval forests , it is possible to find some tree leaves , insects or roots of plants , but these are hard to find in G@@ ob@@ i deserts in southwestern and northwestern China .
from 2001 to 2003 , when I was in the un@@ inhabited areas in western China , I ate wild mice several times .
I even searched for skelet@@ ons of Tibetan ant@@ el@@ opes and Mongolian gaz@@ elles eaten by wolves .
the skelet@@ ons were surrounded by some flies .
I was so thirsty and hungry that I started to catch the flies and eat them .
I bet I can catch at least eight out of ten flies within five minutes .
normally , I would squeeze the liquid out of the belly of the fly and eat it .
it was sticky , t@@ ast@@ eless but with a little bit of water .
I ate the liz@@ ard , the scor@@ pi@@ on and all kinds of small insects such as the little black beetle .
when even these things were not available and I was thirsty and hungry , I would start to drink my own urine .
along the way , I put the urine in the bottle , filtered it with a mask and put some anti @-@ inflammatory pills into it .
I don &apos;t know whether the pills would dis@@ infect the urine , but I thought the pills were better than none .
and when there was no urine , I would poke a hole in the finger@@ tip or the finger pad with a utility knife and take 50 to 100 grams of blood .
I was not really drinking my blood .
the truth is the blood has a little liquid and could in a sense moistur@@ ize my mouth .
everything is very difficult to do , but we should not think of it as difficult .
stick to it and we &apos;ll get through it .
and the following are the photos about environmental protection I took along the way .
nowadays environmental protection is an issue of common concern .
but 20 years ago , few people paid attention to environment .
since late 1980s , I &apos;ve been an environmental volunteer .
since our birth , we have been enjoying the things that nature has brought us , including our food , clothing and our shelters .
and it is worthwhile to ask ourselves what we have done for nature .
there was something that I thought was no mean feat .
with a set of 90 @-@ yuan clothes , a pair of 40 @-@ yuan shoes and 130 @-@ yuan equipment , I made it to 7@@ 000 meters in Mount Everest .
I wanted to experience how high I could climb , since I wasn &apos;t a trained , professional mountain@@ eer , I didn &apos;t go any further .
however , along the way between 5,000 meters and 7@@ 000 meters in Mount Everest , I picked up the rubbish which was thrown by mountain@@ e@@ ers all over the world and can never be degraded in a sn@@ ak@@ es@@ kin bag .
this is the destination of my trip .
lo@@ p N@@ ur Lake .
my journey went strictly according to the plan .
the only exception was L@@ op N@@ ur because I didn &apos;t want to violate my own wishes .
my hiking around Xinjiang took place in 2002 and 2003 , when I travelled all its states and regions , including the three famous mountains , namely the Al@@ tai Mountains , the Kun@@ lu@@ n Mountains and Tian Shan , and two G@@ ob@@ i deserts , the Tari@@ m Basin and the Jun@@ gar Basin .
but when I was going to set foot on L@@ op N@@ ur , it occurred to me that countless pioneers and heroes died there .
I was afraid of death too , so I came to the sudden decision that I would first travel the rest of China and reserve L@@ op N@@ ur for my last trip .
life or death , I would explore it .
on 9 October , 2008 , I traveled all the places as planned .
and the last trip was L@@ op N@@ ur Lake .
the original plan was to take the route of Yu Chun@@ shun , that is to walk along the North Bank to the middle of L@@ op N@@ ur Lake and then to L@@ oul@@ an , and finally walk out through the Qi@@ an@@ jin Bridge . it would take five to seven days .
but after careful thinking , I decided to challenge myself again .
this challenge was inspired by one poem of Wang Wei , a gifted poet in the Tang Dynasty .
in fact , life or death , I would thank him anyway .
the poem goes like this , &quot; A morning dri@@ zzle in the Town of Wei lights dust on the ground we@@ ts / Out@@ side the hostel wil@@ lows grow green and fresh / B@@ id@@ ding you farewell , I &apos;d like to offer you one more toast / For west of the Sun Gate you won &apos;t come across any old friend . &quot;
I think I should start from Yang@@ guan , so I went to Dun@@ huang in Gansu province .
in Yang@@ guan , I had my nearly one @-@ meter hair that I had grown for ten years cut .
I thought I was bound to die there . I had no confidence because one one had come out of that place alive since there were written records .
I cut off my hair before my departure , because if I really died , no one would cut my hair as a memorial .
I cut it when I am still alive .
when I left for Yang@@ guan , a lot of media came to see me off , and I was so moved that I burst into tears .
I set off without any hesitation .
my original plan was to spend 40 to 45 days crossing the L@@ op N@@ ur Lake , but in the end it only took me 31 days .
but during that 1@@ 100 kilometers trip , I encountered too many incidents of life and death .
I experienced sand@@ storms , and F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 winds .
it was difficult to take even a single step , so I lay prone on the sand dun@@ es , changing post@@ ures every dozens of minutes .
after more than ten hours , the sand@@ storm died down , and I found the sand d@@ une I lay on was more than ten meters higher than the others , because there was resistance .
and there was a wolf which followed me for 94 kilometers .
but finally I drove it away .
at that critical moment , it remained unknown which of us would be eaten by the other .
in L@@ op N@@ ur Lake , I managed to track down the place where Peng ji@@ am@@ u , a famous scientist , disappeared in 1980 .
I found a tom@@ b@@ stone there and I stayed there for one night .
the next day , I tried to search for his body and relics but in vain .
that year , Peng went on a scientific expedition with his team , but right on this place , they ran out of water .
he left his team members a note telling them to stay there and rest .
then he ventured out for water and for two days there were no traces of him . and until today , there has been no news about him , not even a body .
and I also found traces of Yu Chun@@ shun , who started his journey across China in 1998 , no , it &apos;s in 1988 and died in L@@ op N@@ ur Lake in 1996 .
we met once in the Greater Kh@@ ing@@ an Range in Heilongjiang province and exchanged a few words .
Mr. Yu was my hero .
he covered nearly 40,000 kilometers , visiting 36 ethnic minorities areas .
but he died one day after he ventured into the L@@ op N@@ ur Lake .
I rested beside his grave for one night and came across something totally unexpected .
I don &apos;t believe supersti@@ tions but there are still things science cannot explain .
I found L@@ oul@@ an where I picked a pottery dated back to the fourth century and a felt hat for kids .
these were blown to me by the wind .
of course , I didn &apos;t go there to be a grave di@@ gger .
and I also found the skelet@@ ons of a wild camel that was eaten by a wolf and took its ho@@ of .
the wild camel is on the verge of extinction , even ra@@ rer than the panda .
the ho@@ of is also kept in my exhibition , and I also brought it here today .
what &apos;s more , I spotted some fossils in Xinjiang , of course , in un@@ inhabited areas .
these two seemingly ordinary stones turned out to be fossils from more than 100 million years ago .
this is the fossil of shells and that is the fossil of tree seeds .
at that time , the un@@ inhibited areas are in the desert , the G@@ ob@@ i deserts and the mountains .
to be honest , I &apos;ve benefited greatly from the 10 @-@ year journey .
I &apos;ve gathered 2 tons of materials and I &apos;ve held a personal exhibition .
I don &apos;t come here for commercial purposes today .
but I want to say I have written two books even though I didn &apos;t graduate from elementary school .
one of them is Ten Years of Wal@@ king Ac@@ ross China and the other is 31 Days of Cros@@ sing L@@ op N@@ ur Lake .
Mr. Du just mentioned about publishing books .
I feel a bit ashamed to say that these books sell quite well .
this book came out in mid @-@ November of 2012 .
but at the end of December , 2012 , it surged on top of the rankings of China &apos;s Most Influ@@ ential non @-@ fiction of 2012 .
this book was published in mid @-@ May this year and it has been out of stock several times .
in the past seven months , more than 100,000 copies have been sold .
I &apos;m not trying to show off , because I couldn &apos;t never have written two books without my experience of the ten @-@ year adventure .
therefore , travel is a way of life and it is also an attitude .
I had an idea at that time , put it into action , and finally made my dream come true .
when I walked out of the L@@ op N@@ ur Lake , I took this national flag with me which I have been carrying for ten years .
I am very patriotic and I believe that everyone in this room is just equally patriotic .
this flag witnessed me coming to land@@ marks such as the border@@ line and coastal line , Hong Kong , Macao , Taiwan and the X@@ isha Islands .
these are the photos I took .
the more than 40,000 photos I took are all sel@@ fies .
in the first eight years , the pictures were taken with the film and in the last two years , it was the digital camera .
when I raised this flag , I was close to tears .
and when I kne@@ eled down to the land , I could no longer hold my tears .
I burst into tears .
as a man , kne@@ eling down is not easy , because as the saying goes , a man should have dignity and not gro@@ vel or bow down .
however , he can kne@@ el down before his parents , his ancestors and the heaven and the earth .
I kne@@ eled to express my thanks to this mysterious land for not claiming my life .
and I &apos;m very grateful to my parents for giving me such a strong life .
this August , I &apos;m going to start a new journey to an un@@ inhabited area in Xinjiang , the highest shifting sand desert in the world .
I &apos;m always on the way .
because on the way , I could find the feeling of being part of nature .
recently , a young man from the United States made the same mistake as the president mentioned earlier .
what mistake was that ?
he didn &apos;t communicate very well with the president online .
then the president was eager to communicate with him face @-@ to @-@ face , which led to the S@@ now@@ den case .
what does S@@ now@@ den mean ?
it &apos;s the name for a place in England .
S@@ now@@ den means the peak of a snow mountain .
some of you love hiking in the mountains .
well , S@@ now@@ den is a snow@@ ball that rolled from Hawaii to Hong Kong , then to Moscow .
we don &apos;t know where it will roll to next .
but one thing is for sure , the snow@@ ball will grow bigger and bigger .
do you agree with me ?
as a result , he has caused a debate around the world .
as Chang@@ jian mentioned earlier , there &apos;s a growing debate about the right to privacy versus national security .
half of the people believe S@@ now@@ den hurt the national interest of the United States , while the other half see him as a hero because a whist@@ le@@ b@@ lower is what American society needs the most .
American society attaches a lot of importance to individual privacy .
so much so to the extent that their constitution , established over 2@@ 37 years ago , has never been changed .
it only has 27 amendments to the constitution .
it &apos;s very hard to pass an amendment because the U.S. has set a pretty high threshold .
however , out of the 20 some amendments , 14 are related to privacy or civil rights .
since national interests and civil rights are the most important , the Fourth Amendment will be discussed today .
such as , you have the right to remain silent ; anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law , and so on .
this is one of the most basic principles in the constitutional amendment .
that is , without a justified reason , the government can neither invade a civilian &apos;s privacy , damage a civilian &apos;s property nor arrest them .
they are protected by the constitution .
now the thing has been revealed , someone might say , &quot; Look , even the U.S. has become a police state , where civilians have lost a lot of their rights . &quot;
the U.S. Constitution is based on legal cases .
in many situations , the constitution protects rights of an individual to a great extent that in order to protect individual rights , there &apos;s a chance that even mur@@ derers might be set free .
speaking of mur@@ derers , I would like to share a case with you .
it was about a black American football star .
one day he was arrested , the police accused him of killing his ex @-@ wife , a white woman , and her boyfriend , who was also white and a waiter .
the news went viral because the accused was a famous athlete .
it was a story about an inter@@ racial marriage between a rich black man and a beautiful white woman , who then ran away with another white man .
it was like a TV drama .
a jury was formed , and I believe all of you know the result .
the jury , composed mostly of black people , claimed that the prosecutor didn &apos;t provide enough evidence to prove 100 % that Simpson committed the murders . in legal terms , this is called &apos; beyond a responsible doubt . &quot;
of course , the verdict was contrary to public opinion , and the opposite of what we believe .
the analysis of all the evidence , along with the DNA from the scene , which was also studied by Li Chang@@ yu , a famous detective in China , concluded that there was a one in three billion@@ th chances that Simpson was not at the crime scene .
however , Americans claimed that the prosecutor didn &apos;t have adequate evidence to persuade the jury .
the defense didn &apos;t have to prove that their client wasn &apos;t guilty ; it was the prosecutor &apos;s job to provide enough evidence to prove his guilt .
in the end , Simpson &apos;s dream team successfully made the jury believe that there was enough reasonable doubt in the case .
in short , a white policeman was involved in the case , and there was a history of him making hat@@ eful remarks about black people , so the defendant was acqu@@ itted .
the presiding judge and I are good friends .
he is of Japanese descent , and his name is I@@ to .
when I delivered speeches in other places , people would often ask me , &quot; The case looked quite clear to me , so why set the murderer free ? &quot;
I said that there &apos;s nothing I can do because that &apos;s the law in the United States .
unless you and I have God &apos;s phone number and can call to ask whether they saw the murderer , we have no choice but to believe the jury &apos;s verdict .
but there is also something positive that comes out of the case as well .
what &apos;s that ?
it is a reminder to all American policemen and prosecutors , that when you are enforcing laws , you might find enough evidence to prove someone &apos;s guilt , but the way to obtain it can &apos;t violate people &apos;s civil rights .
that is to say , obtaining evidence illegally will not make someone a hero or get them promoted .
instead , it might actually make them look bad because protecting an individual &apos;s rights is something that can &apos;t be ignored .
it also makes us pay closer attention to government employees when it comes to protecting the rights of citizens , especially ethics .
Nixon , a famous U.S. president and an old friend of China , has a good reputation here , but not back at home .
I think you all know that his reputation suffers because of Water@@ gate , but it has nothing to do with water or a gate .
Water@@ gate is a hotel in D.@@ C ..
one of Nixon &apos;s staff volunteered to sneak into his competitor &apos;s office to steal documents and Nixon tried to cover it up .
under great pressure , Congress set up a special committee and demanded Nixon to hand in all of the recorded audio to the special prosecutors , as well as his own personal recordings .
so Nixon ev@@ oked his presidential immunity and claimed that if he handed in all the information , their national interest would be threatened .
the U.S. Supreme Court , which I am eligible to appear in , ve@@ to@@ ed him by saying that the president couldn &apos;t avoid liability with the excuse of national security because it would hurt his credibility .
as the top government official , he had to hand in all the evidence .
all of the evidence is in my hometown .
I &apos;m from L.@@ A. and the evidence is kept in the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum . it &apos;s only a 20 @-@ minute drive from my home , and you can listen to any of the recordings .
the U.S. pays a lot of attention to an individual &apos;s rights , which often seems like a pendulum , a theory that I have talked a lot about .
how is it like a pendulum ?
well , let &apos;s assume that national security is on the right , while individual rights are on the left .
whenever a major event occurs and the national interest is threatened , the pendulum will strongly swing to the right .
for example , think about the Pearl Harbor attack .
we all know that the U.S. had no interest in starting a war with Japan .
take a look at the September 11th terrorist attack and the recent Boston Mar@@ athon bombing .
when major events like these happen , the pendulum will strongly swing to the right , and a series of laws will be passed to strengthen the government &apos;s right to protect national security .
sometimes I wonder what would have happened if the S@@ now@@ den case hadn &apos;t occurred around the time of the Boston Mar@@ athon incident , or if it would &apos;ve occurred next year instead .
which direction would the pendulum swing to in the hearts of American people ?
would the results of U.S. public opinion that I mentioned earlier be the same ?
it &apos;s obvious that without the September 11th terrorist attack , the Pat@@ riot Act would never have been passed in Congress .
that would be out of question .
even though the U.S. Constitution hasn &apos;t evolved , like the oil paintings in the West , the supervision and ver@@ dic@@ ts around cases tried in the Supreme Court can change with time@@ .The pendulum can often swing to both sides .
but most of the time , during the past 2@@ 37 years , you will notice that the pendulum has stayed in the middle .
for some time , American people have had this kind of pendulum in their hearts , swinging between individual rights and national security .
so what I want to say is that , national security inter@@ we@@ aves with people &apos;s expectations of privacy and they evolve with one another , so do their expectations about the right to privacy that change over time .
let me share another case with you .
in California , the police suspected that a couple was making &apos; ice , &quot; a drug , at home .
the police couldn &apos;t go to the judge and say , &quot; Okay , we suspect that someone is making ice at home , so please sign a warrant for us to break into their home . &quot;
the judge would laugh his head off and say , &quot; No , we are not in Cuba , you can &apos;t just break into someone &apos;s house . &quot;
the police were smart and modern technology has offered people more possibilities .
they installed a high @-@ power thermal imag@@ er in the public area on the opposite side of the couple &apos;s house to collect images 24 hours .
I &apos;ve never made ice before , but I heard that if you make it , your indoor temperature would rise quickly , especially in the kitchen .
so the police handed in the evidence to the judge and it was approved .
the prosecutor pressed charges against the couple , but they were set free .
why ?
because the judge said that the citizens &apos; right to privacy and the Fourth Amendment were highly valued .
the reason was that if a couple stayed at home in their bedroom , with the curtains open , they could reasonably expect that in today &apos;s society , someone might watch them with a high @-@ powered telescope from afar .
but any couple couldn &apos;t reasonably expect that with the curtains closed , someone would use a thermal imag@@ er to collect images 24 hours from a close distance .
that wasn &apos;t a reasonable expectation , so it was in violation of the Fourth Amendment .
in conclusion , I wonder if China is also experiencing a similar process of information overload .
the Internet has given us an unlimited space to explore our imagination , as well as a platform for communication between school presidents and students .
some people also say that China &apos;s anti @-@ corruption initiative basically relies on the Internet , but the Internet can also destroy people because there is so much false information floating out there .
the development of China &apos;s Internet will also encounter similar issues .
but I think stones from other hills may serve to polish the jade of this one .
I believe we can use the experience the U.S. is going through today as a reference .
the more the Internet flows through China , the wider it can serve national security and make people &apos;s daily life more convenient .
isn &apos;t this a wonderful world ?
right ?
thank you very much .
good evening , everyone .
today we are going to talk about a serious topic .
it is about studying .
however , in fact , as it was said before , the work can be so fun .
I believe that actually we can also make learning very fun .
first of all , I would like to ask one question : how many of you believe that you love study ?
please raise your hands .
OK , we have seen that most audiences have raised hands , but there are still a few people who haven &apos;t . so , for those audiences who haven &apos;t raised your hands , don &apos;t you come to this room for avoiding summer heat , do you ?
well , everyone here has enthusiasm for study .
we all know that there are many challenges hin@@ dering study .
ah , can you tell me what challenges are you facing now ?
OK . I may not see every one &apos;s face so clearly .
please speak up so that we can learn about the challenges you are facing .
Oh , there are too many goals .
some people say that there are too many books .
ah , someone says that as there are so many things to learn , he may get lost .
there is little time to study .
it &apos;s hard to persevere .
anything else ?
it &apos;s easy to forget what has been learnt .
very good .
anything else ?
what I learn is what I have to learn rather than what I want to learn .
very good .
I believe the aforementioned answers have shown many problems we may face today during studying .
in fact , as many audiences have said before , on the one hand , there is the flood of information .
more new models , concepts and theories emerge .
just as the picture illustrated , there is a tremendous amount of books .
anyway , I dare not write a book .
after I went to the book building in X@@ id@@ an , I have realized that even if another book has been written , that book will just be like pouring a bowl of water into the sea .
what is the significance and value ?
yes , I dare not write it anymore .
therefore , how can we study more effectively ?
just as someone mentioned , how to study within a limited time ?
thirdly , how can we confirm that we &apos;ve acquired it ?
if I forgot it , does it mean that I didn &apos;t acquire it ?
where are those things that have been acquired ?
how to prove that I really acquired it ?
I attempt to summarize whether there are some rules and principles of learning .
which can truly help us to solve these three problems .
therefore , influenced by the Beijing &quot; T@@ n@@ Dao , &quot; I sum up three rules and principles .
the first principle is reading Dao .
the first thing is to read .
maybe once we speak of study , reading books come to most people &apos;s mind .
first and foremost , it &apos;s to read Dao .
secondly , it &apos;s what I call listening to Dao .
in fact , today we are just doing one thing , i.e. , listening to Dao .
thirdly , it is what I call teaching Dao , i.e. telling others what you have learned .
what does it have to do with studying ? I &apos;ll share a story with you .
once upon a time , I knew a very large Chinese internet company with successful game business .
the head of the company said to me through a friend , &quot; Can you help me find an education expert to help us design the game ? &quot;
it sounds good .
did he intend to , same to what the former speaker Mr. Su said , add some educational content in the game ?
then , during the chat , he amazed me .
he said , &quot; I also have recruited a group of experts . one of them is very excellent . he is working on the post@@ doctoral research of biology . &quot;
I said , &quot; Why does your game company also need a post@@ doc in biology ? what aspect of biology is he studying on ? &quot;
he said : &quot; he is studying on the happiness mechanism of gor@@ illas . &quot;
hearing his words , I was convinced .
immediately , I truly understood why games could make so many people addicted to it .
the reason is that the head of the game company is studying on gor@@ illas .
he also told us that his research field was in fact the most instinc@@ tive aspect .
he designed games based on human instinct , which I believe it &apos;s very impressive .
also , I have participated in some television shows for job @-@ seekers , in the field of human resources .
I have noticed that many mature business ty@@ co@@ ons , and large companies with training capabilities never have recruitment requirements for majors .
after training , they may make a student from department of Chinese language and literature undertake the financial work and a student from the math department become a salesperson .
what &apos;s the rationale behind ?
what does the company seek for ?
it seeks for the most basic competen@@ cies and abilities of a person .
for example , McKin@@ sey is an investment bank and consultant firm , but it can be seen that it recruits less and less students maj@@ oring in finance and accounting .
what kind of talents does it recruit now ?
what kind of talents it needs ?
it needs students maj@@ oring in science and engineering .
truly , science and engineering .
then , the company gives them some special training .
what abilities does the company take advantage of from the talents ?
still the abilities to think critically , to solve problems quickly and learn quickly , and to extend their knowledge and skills .
in the future , students maj@@ oring in exten@@ ics will be more favored .
therefore , it inspired us . what should we learn ?
in fact , to learn the fundamental knowledge , we should talk about the first principle &quot; reading Dao . &quot;
we should read classics .
there are two types of classics .
the first type refers to the classics in your professional field .
what are the benefits of classics ?
classics don &apos;t teach you how to do .
instead , they explain the ration@@ ales and reasons .
I don &apos;t know how many audiences &apos; work is relevant to the company management ?
also , the audience , who need to learn management , please also raise your hands .
quite a few .
I think to learn management , you should read Dr@@ uc@@ ker &apos;s works first , including The Practice of Management and The Effective Executive .
the reason why Dr@@ uc@@ ker is called the master of masters in management is that he taught management from the perspective of philosophy with the plain@@ est language .
instead of teaching the way to management people , he taught the principles behind management .
therefore , the principles behind management are the fundamental , the essence and cornerstone , which enable you to truly stand high and become far @-@ sighted .
of course , some people have said that their work is unrelated to their majors .
people always asked me , &quot; Mr. Du , what kind of major should I choose ? &quot;
I said that if you didn &apos;t have any particular and clear preferences , you should purely be engaged in science and engineering or humanities .
today , many heads of company asked : &quot; if I have the opportunity to go back to college , what should I study ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Just forget about the MBA program . as for EM@@ BA , if you don &apos;t want to use the diploma to make friends , meet business partners or look for a girlfriend , just forget it , too . &quot;
what should heads of company learn if they are provided with the chance to return to college today ?
they should learn philosophy , history , sociology , anthropology , art , and music .
these are the very majors that can make you pre@@ eminent .
therefore , if the time and resources are limited , the first choice for reading books should be Dao , that is , the classics .
since we need to find out the directions in life and work , where is the direction ?
how can we find the direction quickly within a limited time ?
in another example , many people are making investments .
today , investment banks are also popular .
isn &apos;t it known to all that nowadays , there is a large amount of money but fewer good projects , is it ?
then , how can an investor quickly make a judgment in an area he is not familiar with ?
there is a Chinese investor who has helped three different companies to go public in the US .
I am helping young people to start a business now , so we interviewed him .
he said : &quot; I can confidently say that if you give me three months , I can basically get a clear picture of one industry or field . &quot;
he gave an example .
what was that example ?
when he entered the hotel industry , he did following things .
firstly , he read books .
of course , there is no classic in the hotel industry .
so , what did he read ?
he read the bi@@ ograp@@ hies of the founders of the most famous hotel brands in the world carefully .
he was not satisfied with reading those books .
he travelled around the world to visit these founders , and then talked to them , for one or two hours at minimum , and one or two days at maximum .
these people were very willing to tell him all the experience over the decades .
in addition to the successful experience , they also told him frustrations especially and insights .
he didn &apos;t stop yet .
he also found other people and listened to their stories .
who were those people ?
it could be staff in a hotel .
he might ask the hotel receptionist to tell him about her working experience and the way to cope with clients .
he talked to the elderly cleaner who was responsible for room cleaning and the client who just entered the hotel lobby .
after the chat , he said that he knew about the industry .
therefore , it is to listen Dao .
we should listen to those who have experienced ups and downs and accumulated insights , listen to the essence of their knowledge and experience .
just like the speech here today , many people tell us about their wisdom and the experience of life , and we obtain it in the shortest time .
as a Chinese saying goes , &quot; Tal@@ king with you for one moment is much better than reading books for ten years . &quot;
I believe it is the same with study .
of course , sometimes , we may say that the investors own wealth and their companies are listed in the U.S , so it &apos;s easy for them to find those celebrities .
how should we ordinary people do ?
how should we ordinary people do ?
one of my colleagues enlightened me .
when his daughter was choosing the major for college , he didn &apos;t seek help from education experts .
he phoned seven or eight friends , and I was one of them .
he said : &quot; Ku@@ i Du , can you give me a hand ? my daughter is going to fill in a college application form . can you spend two hours talking to her ? you don &apos;t need to tell her what major she should choose . please just tell her the way you reach your present position . at present , what makes you feel happy , helpless , painful and un@@ satisfied ? &quot;
the people he phoned include heads of the company , the senior management , ordinary people , secretaries , the government officials , and the house@@ wives .
he even let his daughter talk to house@@ wives .
after the chat , the girl chose her major with ease and confidence .
in my opinion , this father is very smart , because he knows that we , and our children , are actually not choosing majors .
what are we choosing ?
we are choosing different lives , and states of life .
what she should see is the state of life rather than the content of a major .
the reason is that there are various states of life in one profession .
therefore , I always tell people that it is not the major or profession that matters .
the way you want to live matters .
how can we get those information ?
listen to Dao .
there is another interesting question for you .
can you tell me how many ways to tie the sho@@ el@@ aces ?
please speak out aloud how many ways you know .
Oh , just one .
is there anyone who knows more than three ways ?
congratulations on those audiences who know more than three ways .
I will tell you the answer later .
a few years ago , I went to a friend &apos;s family .
he has a kid who went to elementary school , probably in Grade Three or Four , but he couldn &apos;t tie the sho@@ el@@ aces well .
that day , his father said to him again , &quot; You are such a big man , why can &apos;t you tie the sho@@ el@@ aces well ? &quot;
my major is education anyway , right ?
however , I didn &apos;t know how to teach him to tie his sho@@ el@@ aces .
neither did I know why he couldn &apos;t do it well .
I suggested that we motivate the boy in another way .
&quot; hey , &quot; I said , &quot; Xia@@ op@@ eng , I don &apos;t know how to tie the sho@@ el@@ aces , neither . next time I come , can you teach me how to tie my sho@@ el@@ aces ? &quot;
his interest was stimulated immediately .
when I visited again , I said , &quot; Xia@@ op@@ eng , have you puzzled out how to tie sho@@ el@@ aces ? &quot;
he said : &quot; Oh ! uncle Du , I know it so well . &quot;
he said : &quot; uncle Du , can you guess how many kinds of ways are there ? &quot;
I said : &quot; three . &quot;
he said : &quot; no , let me tell you . &quot;
it is two hundred .
I was astonished at the time , but I only asked him a simple question .
I said , &quot; Uncle Du &apos;s sho@@ el@@ aces always come loose . I know how to tie them , but can you tell me how to deal with the loose sho@@ el@@ aces ? &quot;
he said : &quot; it &apos;s just a piece of cake . &quot;
he said : &quot; if you go right over left for the first knot , then for the second knot , you should go left over right . the reason is that we basically tie the sho@@ el@@ aces in one direction , so you just need to make the knots in opposite directions .
I asked , &quot; How does it work ? &quot;
he said : &quot; doesn &apos;t the key to tying sho@@ el@@ aces lie in increasing friction ? &quot;
I knew the boy already obtained the &quot; Dao &quot; for tying sho@@ el@@ aces .
when he truly compreh@@ ended the &quot; Dao , &quot; he could teach others . only when you are able to teach others , can you truly understand the &quot; Dao . &quot;
every one , after my speech today , I hope you can tell the aforementioned three principles of Dao to others .
if you return home , please tell your family first .
tomorrow , you may tell your colleagues .
if there is any chance , you can tell the public and strangers .
I believe that when all of you talk about them , then there will emerge more than three principles of Dao .
there can be four , five , seven , and seventy .
thank you !
hello everyone !
well , before I came up to the stage , the makeup artist said to me , &quot; Mr. Z@@ ang , come here and I need to give you some makeup . &quot;
I told her , &quot; Well , makeup is fine . but I have a small request . can you do me a hair@@ style of three @-@ seven parting ? &quot;
then the makeup artist said , &quot; Three @-@ seven parting is impossible , but I can draw three hairs on your head . &quot;
then I said to her , &quot; I am a person with ambition . if you cannot satisfy this little request of mine , &quot; I said , &quot; You might sti@@ fle my ambition . &quot;
there are many kinds of pursuits .
following this pursuit logic , I suggest that taxi drivers should learn to be a CEO and CF@@ O , at the same time take their car as an enterprise and learn to be a manager and operator of it .
in the past , taxi drivers were usually considered as laborers .
so if you are thinking as a CEO , what should you know first to manage this car as an enterprise ?
cost accounting .
so normally , I work 17 hours a day and take a day off after one day on duty , as a routine for taxi drivers in Shanghai .
my performance indicator and fuel cost every day add up to around 6@@ 80 yuan , which makes my cost 40 yuan an hour .
then how much for per minute ?
sixty @-@ six cents .
when I wait for the red light for one minute , even if there are passengers on the car , how much do they give me ?
a waiting fee of 48 cents .
every minute I spend waiting for the red light will raise my cost by 27 % .
so many passengers would say , &quot; Sir , hurry up ! drive faster and get through the green light , will you ? &quot;
in fact , you shouldn &apos;t hasten the driver .
he is more anxious than you .
you may think you you are paying to wait , but actually he is losing money .
the money he has collected from you cannot cover the cost .
so what are the three most essential elements for a taxi driver to run his or hers business ?
firstly , control your empty probability ; secondly , speed creates benefits ; thirdly , distance creates benefits .
once , when I was on a TV show of the CCTV , the host asked me a question : &quot; there is a scientific working method in any industry . please , Mr. Z@@ ang , as a taxi driver , what is your scientific working method ? &quot;
I said two words : &quot; laws and Prob@@ ability . &quot;
we work in accordance with certain laws .
when we sum up the laws to a certain extent , there comes our scientific method .
however , any law must contain some risks .
when we learn to control the risks in the laws with probability , well , then you &apos;ve become a CEO and you can succeed .
you probably know , there is relatively less business on the roads in Shanghai on weekends .
once on a Saturday morning , my taxi was parked at the gate of Sud@@ i Chun@@ xi@@ ao , a very well @-@ known residential community on Chang@@ sh@@ ou Road .
at that time . there were five taxis , and I was the fourth .
well , ten minutes later , only one of the five cars left .
who left ?
me .
there were still other four cars , but I left first as the fourth in the line .
why ?
many people said , &quot; Why ? &quot;
because when I was parking , I think like a CEO .
in other words , I knew how to use strategy to park .
&quot; how could parking as the fourth be a strategy ? don &apos;t be silly ! &quot;
don &apos;t rush to the judgment .
firstly , when all our taxis were parked over there , there were five cars , mine included .
but I was the only driver who was cleaning the car with a rag .
secondly , it was still a little hot in August and September .
I was the only one who closed the windows and turned on the air conditioner .
thirdly , in that hot spell , many drivers were wearing shirts with loose buttons , and I was the only one wearing a tie and shirt .
the three &quot; only &quot; differences are my strategy , which eventually brought me a customer first .
therefore , we have always been stressing that in the service industry , you need to think all the time .
having known about strategy and cost accounting , we still have to pay great attention to details .
once , a passenger took my car to Pudong , so I chose to hit there by Nan@@ pu Bridge .
there are three lanes on the bridge , left , middle and right .
I took the left lane .
then the passengers asked me , &quot; Sir , others usually take the right lane . why do you take the left ? &quot;
at that time , the road conditions were very good and there were no cars on three lanes .
I said , &quot; You know what , there is a big difference between driving on the left lane and the right . &quot;
firstly , the left lane is 400 meters faster than the right lane .
that &apos;s because cars have to run two and a half circles to reach Nan@@ pu Bridge , so I take the left lane to inv@@ isi@@ bly save you one yuan of fare , which is quite good .
secondly , if I have no passenger on the car , I will take the left lane , which can virtually save myself 400 meters of fuel ?
thirdly , the 6@@ 80 yuan of cost a day I mentioned just now includes the maintenance costs borne by the enterprise .
so isn &apos;t it a way to save the 400 @-@ meter vehicle maintenance costs for the enterprise by taking the left lane ?
fourthly , when I take the left lane , as a passenger , you will feel more stable and comfortable in the car .
because the smaller the inner diameter , the less the centrifugal force . &quot;
when I finished saying these four points , the passenger looked at me and said , &quot; I guess I know who you are now . &quot;
he said , &quot; Give me your phone number or your business card , and I &apos;ll find you the next time when I need to go for a long distance . &quot;
I said , &quot; Thank you . &quot;
that &apos;s how details hold the key to success , but I find that people who pay attention to details are often perfec@@ tion@@ ists .
in fact , you can tell my hair@@ style that I am pursuing perfection .
so how should our mind be poised while we have been pursuing a lot of material things ?
there is a saying in the service industry that customers are God .
I would like to ask everyone present today : who has seen God ?
please raise your hand .
Oh , no one d@@ ares to .
well , in my understanding , it seems that the customer is not God , since no one has ever seen God .
so what is the customer ?
before the customer gets on my car , he is my strategic partner , and after he gets on my car , I will take him as my lover .
I always want to fall in love with every man or woman that takes my taxi .
many people will ask : &quot; Mr. Z@@ ang , what will you talk about with the passengers that you are in love with ? &quot;
about what ?
care , love and communication .
once , when I was on Chang@@ sh@@ ou Road , a passenger took my taxi and she said to me , &quot; Mister , drive through the gate of the community , please . &quot;
I said , &quot; What &apos;s the matter ? &quot;
she said , &quot; Well , my dad fell and hit his head . please help me pick him up and then take him to the hospital . &quot;
I said , &quot; No problem . &quot;
I didn &apos;t expect after driving to the building of her apartment , she would still ask me for another favor , &quot; Mr. Z@@ ang , could you help me carry my dad downstairs ? he is getting too old . &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
then we went up and get father down together , get on the car and then go to the hospital .
then I asked her , &quot; Why didn &apos;t you call 120 ? what can you do if there are no taxi on the road just now ? and your father hit his head . &quot;
hearing this , she said to me : &quot; sir , I called 120 and the ambulance didn &apos;t come . only when I came out did I meet one taxi of yours . you were faster than 120 . &quot;
then at this time I heard the old man said , &quot; D@@ au@@ ghter , I &apos;m feeling a little dizzy and naus@@ eous , I want to pu@@ ke &quot;
hearing this , I took out my mobile phone and di@@ aled 120 .
I said , &quot; Is that EM@@ T center ? I &apos;ll send a patient to XX@@ X hospital right away . it will take about five to seven minutes to arrive there . my license number is XX@@ X . please tell the doctors and param@@ ed@@ ics to wait for us at the entrance of the emergency room . &quot;
five or seven minutes later , I carried the patient to the entrance of the emergency room and the doctor was already waiting .
why would he certainly be waiting ?
please note that 120 is a recorded phone call .
then the patient &apos;s family , doctors and I took the patient onto the emergency bed and carried him in .
by this time there were already passengers waiting for my taxi .
so I went to serve the next guest .
a lot of people may say , &quot; Mr. Z@@ ang , you are not a good driver . you are ev@@ ading your responsibility . you just want to get this over with as fast as you can and take other passengers . the good drivers will carry the patient passenger on their backs and rush him in all the way , to see the doctor and help with the registration . &quot;
how long does this take ?
15 minutes .
then I would like to ask them : what is our greatest advantage as a taxi driver ?
to hand over the patient as fast as possible to the doctor who can directly help him and save him .
after all , drivers cannot treat diseases .
this is the point .
secondly , the symptoms of vomiting and dizz@@ iness are saying that he may have cerebral hemorrhage .
can you get the patient on your back to run at your will ?
therefore , we must learn to use good methods to do good deeds .
sometimes many of us , without proper methods , may make a mess .
therefore , I think to be a service provider , your service must be appropriate and personalized .
I often tell our drivers that as a professional taxi driver and CEO , what you hold is not the steering wheel but the heart of the passengers .
the direction of each person &apos;s palm will be different .
some drivers hold their palms up forever , waiting for leadership or the superior to give us gifts , while others hold their palms down , giving more help to others .
but my palms are more accustomed to the left and right , why ?
I am more accustomed to cooperating with others and falling in love with others .
recently , I saw a piece of news .
it said that this year marks the 10th anniversary of SARS .
it has been ten years .
ten years ago , Shanghai was attacked by a very serious infectious disease SARS .
as a result , the taxi industry almost became stagnant .
there were no people in the shopping mall and no patients in the hospital .
why ?
no one dared to see the doctor with common ail@@ ments .
then no one came out from commercial buildings for business affairs , and there were few people in the hotels and gu@@ es@@ thous@@ es .
the government was very concerned about us .
each driver received a subsidy of 600 yuan per month .
like our Shanghai D@@ az@@ hong Tax@@ i &amp; Car L@@ easing Company , drivers could eat at any branch at noon and at night , free of charge .
at that time , the driver &apos;s total income was almost only half of the original income .
what about me ?
instead of des@@ cre@@ asing , my income increased slightly .
everyone was wondering where I went for business so I could earn even more ?
when everyone else was waiting in line at the gate of hotels , I was waiting in line at the gate of mor@@ tu@@ aries .
people couldn &apos;t figure out why .
it turned out that when a funeral was held , invitations would generally not be declined .
even under those special circumstances , it is not okay to refuse and stay at home .
and the funeral home has a procedure for you that will have you come more than once .
you need to register to book a room first , get a number and wait for several days before you can go there for the funeral .
through my careful observation and analysis , there would be a business at the mor@@ tu@@ aries every four minutes .
therefore , when we encounter financial storms , the sudden changes in the market , including the rise in our oil prices that is out of our control , we only have to learn to change ourselves and adapt to this environment .
there is a very good saying , &quot; The weak wait for opportunities while the strong seize them . &quot;
and I am a wise man : I create opportunities .
with all these golden rules , is it enough ?
some people may satisfy with being there .
but there is still a long way to go , why ?
with the experience of Mr. Z@@ ang shared with others , all the drivers know how to do it well .
what should we do then ?
innovative thinking is a must .
have a new way .
we all know that taxi drivers have to take passengers to make money .
though my car is vacant most of the time , I can earn even more money than you with passengers .
why ?
an innovative service .
many of my current services are beyond your imagination .
some of my clients have called me many times like this : &quot; Mr. Z@@ ang , we have two clients coming to Shanghai . they want to have a city tour for four to five hours to several scenic spots . &quot;
I said , &quot; No problem . &quot;
how much do I charge for an hour ?
one hundred yuan .
a driver runs on the road for one hour normally gets sixty , while I charge one hundred , for let &apos;s say , guide service .
another example .
a company receives guests .
most of the time , when the guests come to visit and enjoy their stay very much , they would like to try Shanghai &apos;s high @-@ tech mag@@ le@@ v before leaving .
he said : &quot; Mr. Z@@ ang , we &apos;d better not let the guest buy tickets . please send him to the mag@@ le@@ v station . buy him a ticket and let him go on the mag@@ le@@ v train . and then you keep the ticket for reimbursement . &quot;
I said , &quot; No problem . I &apos;ll do the reception for your company . &quot;
how about this charge ?
triple the fare from 50 to 150 yuan .
that &apos;s because I help your company with the reception , so the corresponding wage has to be added .
thirdly , I often do express delivery for companies .
some companies called me : &quot; for the customs clearance , here is something very important that I need to fetch from the airport . it &apos;s fragile . I don &apos;t trust the express company . please help me with it . &quot;
the normal fare to Pudong Airport is 180 yuan , which I will charge for this service , too .
sometimes after dropping a passenger off at the airport , I would fetch their courier packages and come back with no passenger .
it is also a good deal .
therefore , it is not enough to have our traditional service alone .
we also need value @-@ added services .
when we have a unique way of doing business that others cannot imitate , customers will keep coming .
a first @-@ class service provider does not go out to look for customers , but draws customers to him .
when we earn money , we have the pleasure of being a good businessman .
and what else ?
the pleasure of learning and achieving success .
we enjoy happiness in enlightenment .
many people often ask me , &quot; Mr. Z@@ ang , what is your secret to success ? &quot;
my answer is : &quot; thinking , acting , passion , persistence , innovation , added with a little bit of diligence , a little bit of reverse thinking , and a little bit of inspiration . &quot;
I am not a genius .
every day , I aspire to make a little progress .
be it a better interpretation or knowledge of a business building , a road , a commercial street , a pedestrian , a traffic light , etc .
many people are asking , &quot; Mr. Z@@ ang , why are you so happy to drive a taxi ? is it because you earn more money than others ? &quot;
yet I want to tell you now it is actually the opposite : it is because I have a happy and positive attitude towards my work that I can earn more money than others .
thank you all !
good evening everyone .
the topic I want to talk about today is , &quot; i @-@ music , i @-@ Love , and i @-@ Think . &quot;
our host has introduced the meaning of &apos; I. &quot;
it represents the &apos; Internet &quot; and &apos; me . &quot;
in today &apos;s society , the Internet revolution is bursting and every industry is being influenced .
every one of us is inevitably facing a choice .
actually , there is no choice , but we think there is one .
the choice is whether we go forward or step backwards .
since life is limited , there aren &apos;t many choices .
and for us , the possibility of avoiding confusion , suspicion , agony and sadness is very low .
so what else could help us besides self @-@ empowerment ?
actually , the heavens , God , Buddha , or whichever name we give it , did leave us with a solution : music .
music is the genuine Band @-@ Aid to our heart .
music is our only hope .
music never asks us for anything , but we can obtain strength and confidence from it .
we can find comfort , consolation , and love to heal our wounds .
we may have many embarrassing moments that we cannot share with anyone , but we can find the best listener in music .
instead of listening to music , I think it &apos;s more likely that music is listening to us .
so &apos; i music &quot; means , &quot; I am the music , and the music is me . &quot;
everyone is a natural musician when they first come into this world .
we have an instrument in our throat called the vocal cords .
let &apos;s not use our thro@@ ats just for talking , but also for singing .
singing gives our spirits a new look , and it provides a very specific direction towards our dreams every day .
it di@@ ms our agony and sadness or makes it disappear , even if it &apos;s just temporary .
I &apos;ve brought some videos with me . let &apos;s watch them together , and see how other people perform music .
I selected some of the content for you because our time is limited . you can find these videos on the Internet without a V@@ P@@ N .
this is an ad from Apple .
it tells us an idea that , &quot; less is more . &quot;
we didn &apos;t bring anything with us when we were born , and we won &apos;t take anything with us after death .
a wealthy man once said , &quot; Sh@@ rou@@ ds have no pockets . &quot;
we can &apos;t take anything away after death , but we can leave something on this planet .
what are you leaving ?
learning music is learning to love .
we know how to love while learning music .
if music is everywhere in our nation , our society , our country and our families , our differences will become less important , and many disputes can be avoided .
it can even reduce the downside of human nature .
is music really that amazing ?
yes , it is .
we often say that the end of languages is the start of music .
the protot@@ yp@@ ical form of music existed before humans even learned any languages .
primitive people communicated with each other by making sounds and gestures , according to what we &apos;ve learned until now .
you know , I didn &apos;t learn how to play the violin when I was a child , but I want to tell everyone about the &apos; i Love &quot; in &apos; i music . &quot;
as long as you have love , anything can be used as a way to express your desires , feelings , affection and unconditional love .
so what will I play for you today ?
I will play the violin on the iP@@ ad that everyone probably knows about .
here we go .
every tablet computer has a thing called a &apos; gy@@ ro@@ scope , &quot; which creates a high and low pitch according to its level .
so this is a highly sophisticated instrument that &apos;s definitely not sil@@ lier than humans .
there are 65 kinds of instruments in it , like the violin , cell@@ o , and so on .
is playing it with this the same as using real instruments ?
does the form matter ?
no , it doesn &apos;t .
but being happy matters .
the point is to be happy , isn &apos;t it ?
don &apos;t turn away happiness if you have the chance , because it &apos;s not easy to come by .
the el@@ ites created it with their creativity , persistence , and hard work .
they brought happiness to every one of us .
so , don &apos;t refuse to be happy .
let happiness into your heart and make you truly happy .
how can we be happy ?
the easiest way is by turning words into a song .
we came to T@@ n@@ Dao today to hear something .
listen to this .
T@@ n@@ Dao , T@@ n@@ Dao , we are at T@@ n@@ Dao today .
happy , happy , everyone should be happy .
wasn &apos;t that fun ?
is it your dream to turn your words into a song at any time ?
when you see a stranger and feel a little bit awkward , you can use this app and play &quot; a sentence at one time &quot; with them .
I &apos;m sure a love letter will be finished soon by doing this .
don &apos;t be afraid of going forward .
new things make our boring and ordinary lives interesting .
they bring light to our seemingly endless hard lives .
I &apos;ll tell you the names of both apps .
the first app is called , Th@@ umb@@ J@@ am .
the thumb is the first digit on our hand .
t @-@ h @-@ u @-@ m @-@ b @-@ J @-@ a @-@ m .
it &apos;s a music studio , and both professionals and amate@@ urs can use it .
the second interesting app , which can turn words into songs , is called Son@@ gi@@ fy .
song , s @-@ o @-@ n @-@ g , and then i @-@ f @-@ y .
combine them , and they become one word , s @-@ o @-@ n @-@ g @-@ i @-@ f @-@ y , Son@@ gi@@ fy .
a graduate from Stanford created this with his girlfriend .
at first they created a voice engine , which could change voices .
they spent 15 months developing it , then sold it to a listed company and received $ 19 million .
maybe you think this is simple , but actually , it can go both ways .
sometimes an idea could not only change your life , but also the world .
I haven &apos;t played much music in the past few years , but I &apos;ve tried many times to compose .
I combined the elements of Buddhist music with the piano , the king of western instruments .
let &apos;s see if we can hear the voice of Buddha in it .
thank you .
I almost got hyp@@ noti@@ zed .
Ho @-@ ho , I must thank I@@ k@@ k@@ yu @-@ san .
in the United States , Indians wear Indian clothes , Middle Eastern people wear Middle Eastern clothes , and we Chinese also wear Chinese clothes .
I have worn this suit for decades .
a few years ago , because of the publication of novels , including those I just presented to you , I had to come back to China to do some promotion activities .
I was very glad that I had returned to Beijing .
when I was in New York , I took the subway a lot , which I &apos;m used to till today .
and in Beijing , the most convenient form of transport must be the subway .
at that time , I just came back from abroad . on the subway , a woman suddenly pat@@ ted me on the shoulder and said , &quot; Hey , I know you . &quot;
I was very happy to be identified .
&quot; Oh , you know me . that &apos;s great . do you know who I am ? &quot;
&quot; I know that you are from D@@ ey@@ un Club , and you perform cross talk , &quot; said she .
thank you very much , Mr. Guo De@@ gang .
actually , I &apos;m just a writer .
today I &apos;d like to talk about the book - Sha@@ king Dragon Cl@@ assic .
by the way , the story I just told you was what truly happened to me .
if you pick up the book , you will find that this book has encountered the same problem as I had on the subway .
both of us have labels .
I have been known for being a cros@@ stalk comedian of D@@ ey@@ un Club , while the book for canv@@ assing feng shui .
Feng shui might be a sensitive topic to many of you .
this book was written a thousand years ago in the Tang Dynasty .
at that time , there were only a few feng shui books in China , maybe only two or three famous ones .
moreover , the feng shui books then were very mysterious and lac@@ onic .
but things began to change because of the Sha@@ king Dragon Cl@@ assic .
from this book , people can learn feng shui in a systematic , method@@ ical , and simple manner .
since then , this book has become the bedro@@ ck of modern feng shui theory .
after the Song Dynasty , because of the prosperity of Ne@@ o @-@ Confucianism , many metap@@ hysical contents , such as yin and yang , the Wu Xing , also known as the Five Elements , and the Eight Diag@@ rams , were combined with geography .
gradually , feng shui study switched from macroscopic perspectives to microscopic ones , and finally we have managed to scale down the bigger things .
today , when we talk about feng shui , you will immediately think of opening the door and arranging the refrigerator .
but the odd thing is that there was no refrigerator in ancient times , considering feng shui is a kind of ancient culture .
well , in fact , we have seen the back side , i.e. the dark side of the Sha@@ king Dragon Cl@@ assic , while what is the bright side of the book ?
this book , in addition to being the bedro@@ ck of feng shui theory , also contains the relic of Chinese geography over more than two thousand years .
when I was studying geography in the United States , I found that it has much in common with the content of the Sha@@ king Dragon Cl@@ assic .
as a matter of fact , Sha@@ king Dragon Cl@@ assic writes a lot about China &apos;s geography , in a very detailed way .
more importantly , what this book writes about is consistent with modern geography .
you may not be familiar with modern geography .
what is geography ?
you may feel that geography means turning up the soil , or digging holes to find mines .
that is geology , not geography .
geography is a discipline that studies the relationship between man and land .
the man @-@ land relationship means that you go to survey a place , and then you can know what will happen there .
although it does not necessarily lead to a definite result , it can give us a good reference for the future , or help you choose a good place at least .
in this sense , this book represents a division line of Chinese geography in the Tang Dynasty .
the upper section of the line is about geography , while the lower section involves feng shui .
and the line embodies the essence of both geography and feng shui .
all these theories are a bit metap@@ hysical .
let &apos;s take a look .
this book is divided into three parts .
the first part describes the big picture of China .
it introduces China from north to south , from Kun@@ lu@@ n Mountain , to Northeast China , and to South Korea , which was mentioned as Sam@@ han , an ancient name for southern Korean peninsula , on the book .
well , I believe people who have studied geography will be very clear about the first part .
the exciting parts are the second and third parts .
the second part talks about a series of ideas , including the concept of harmony between man and nature .
these ideas symbolize genuine fore@@ thought to geography , which were more profound and direct than those in Western geography .
they incorporate all aspects of geography , macro@@ scop@@ ical and microscopic , even human beings .
you may have heard that mountain is related to prosperity , while water to wealth .
anyone who engages in feng shui business would tell you such a saying .
why is that ？
he / she would say if you want to make a fortune , there must be good water in front of your house , and if you wish to have a large family and good health , there must be aus@@ pic@@ iously @-@ shaped mountains .
or in modern feng shui theory , there must be aus@@ pic@@ iously @-@ shaped buildings , which is related to family member and safety .
is this superstition ?
I believe so .
but the same saying in the Sha@@ king Dragon Class@@ ic@@ has nothing to do with superstition .
as we look back into the ancient times , China has had the concept of geography way before the Tang Dynasty , hence the &quot; astronomy and geography &quot; nowadays .
geography is not a term from abroad , instead , it is a Chinese term .
geography studies how to choose a place to establish the capital or a city .
there is another theory , focusing on the study of favorable geological positions , which is derived from geography and studies how to build villages and towns .
by integrating all these elements , the author of the book summarized them into one saying , that is , mountain is related to prosperity , while water wealth .
however , the mountain refers to favorable geographic environment .
the fertility of land and mountain determines whether we can grow crops and whether people can survive here .
please note that , it is vital to human survival , so the author says mountain is related to prosperity .
as for the second part of the saying , that is , water is related to wealth , that &apos;s because the economic exchanges in ancient times are quite different from today .
there are a lot of logistics methods at present , while in ancient times , the best logistics means was waterway transportation .
as the cheapest and the fastest transportation , waterway not only brought about commerce and trades , logistics and business opportunities , etc . , but also pro@@ spe@@ red the land .
therefore , the ancient people attached great importance to the coexistence of mountains and rivers .
only there are mountains and rivers at the same time can a place be called an auspicious one .
I was surprised when I read this book .
the author described the geographical environment of China and even the world by category .
when I was a child , I admired the author Yang Yun@@ song very much , who was addressed respectfully as Yang Gong in the community of geography .
when I grew up , I gradually figured out , this book , in fact , was not written by him alone , because its origin is very legendary .
Yang Yun@@ song served as Guang@@ lu D@@ ai@@ fu , in the end of the Tang Dynasty , a time of chaos .
he was responsible for geom@@ antic geography .
during the chaos , he fled from the imperial palace in Chang &apos;an together with a lot of rare books , all the way sou@@ thward to Jiangxi , and to Guangdong in the end .
on his journey , he took some appren@@ tices and sorted out the books he brought along with him and complied into such a short book .
the books he brought along with him were exactly the ancient geographical liter@@ atures that are increasingly hard to find now in China .
as a matter of fact , from the books of the ancient philosophers including the Com@@ mentary on the Water Cl@@ assic and the Cl@@ assic of Mountains and Se@@ as , we can discover that our ancestors , including Zhuang Zi and Guan Zi , are very familiar with geological environment .
finally the Sha@@ king Dragon Cl@@ assic summarized the essence of the previous books into systematic categories .
before the book , there were never systematic categories , but only accumulation , one book by another .
why Yang Gong would think of doing such a thing ?
that &apos;s because as a government official , he was determined to serve the people .
he hoped this technique of feng shui could be put into use by the common folks .
I have learned geography for several years , and till now , I have to continue to research and verify things all around the world .
by no means could Yong Gong visit so many places by himself , so he could only resort to ancient liter@@ atures .
he sorted out the content for the common folks to use .
Yang Gong put forward a very special concept , which later became the basis of feng shui theory .
what Yang Gong proposed at the time was to match the seven stars in the Big D@@ ipper to all the terr@@ ains on the ground .
the Big D@@ ipper includes Gre@@ edy Wolf , Hu@@ ge Do@@ or and Military Arts , as you can see today ,
out of the sever@@ n stars , three are auspicious stars .
why did he propose such a concept ?
because studying geography is a very complicated task .
yesterday , when I was working on a TV show with a meteor@@ ologist , he told me that if he studied geography now , he would use a lot of instruments to analyze a place first before he could decide whether the place is liv@@ able .
yet I had a different view on that .
I said that I would look at the geographic pattern of the place first .
I would only conduct an analysis if the geographic pattern meets the requirements .
I think my way will be faster than his .
why is that ?
my approach is similar with the idea in the Sha@@ king Dragon Cl@@ assic .
the Sha@@ king Dragon Cl@@ assic mentioned a concept called peak , also known as star peak , which matches the Big D@@ ipper in the sky .
all these star peaks are iconic .
for instance , through high mountains and lofty hills , you will find the Gre@@ edy Wolf star .
sorry .
let &apos;s take a look at the Gre@@ edy Wolf star .
both sides of the star are straight , with a point in the middle , which just echoes the shape of the Tan Lang Mountain .
according to the book , the appearance of the Gre@@ edy Wolf star means the area centered on the star is liv@@ able , and people who live here are especially good at studying and easy to gain political and cultural edges .
we can see the rudi@@ ment of geography here , but we can also find the cultural dislocation when spreading a very profound culture to a common person .
the cause and effect are separated , due to deep reasons .
please pay attention .
here , the Gre@@ edy Wolf star is sharp , while the J@@ u Men star is flat , meaning it should map flat @-@ topped mountains .
when I talked to our organizers a few days ago , they didn &apos;t believe there is a flat @-@ topped mountain .
the truth is there are flat mountains .
you see , in the second picture , there is a flat @-@ topped mountain .
in fact , the number of such mountains are quiet a few , whose shape is very favorable .
there is also a round @-@ topped mountain , like a small steamed bun , the one at the bottom , and the bottom star is called Wu Qu star .
you see , this type of mountain is particularly delicate , and more importantly , especially neat .
this kind of ne@@ at@@ ness represents the fact that in the cru@@ st@@ al movement , they have not been greatly affected , and they have been stable for hundreds of millions of years or even billions of years at least .
when I was in Taiwan , I happened to work with a ge@@ ologist .
during that time , someone asked me if this piece of land was stable .
I said that the land had enjoyed hundreds of millions of years of history .
the ge@@ ologist pointed out , the land was , in fact , younger than I said , and Taiwan had only a history of 100 million years .
as you can imagine , how long it takes for such a big island to stabilize .
then you can see what we humans were 100 million years ago .
at that time , there was no human beings but only dinosaurs .
the beautiful scenery we see today evolved from the age of dinosaurs .
how touching it is !
OK , this represents cru@@ st@@ al stability and the soft shape refers to the thickness of the stratum and soil layer .
let &apos;s get back to the steamed bun @-@ shaped mountain .
could it be covered with rocks ?
of course not . it must be covered with thick soil layer and vegetation .
if there are drum @-@ shaped stone blocks , star@@ k@@ ly raised up like the tips of knives in the mountains , its soil layer must be thin .
you may say the view is wonderful , but the place is not necessarily liv@@ able .
please take a look at these mountains here .
they share a common feature , that is , both sides of them are symmetrical .
from such symmetry , it &apos;s easy for us to understand about the stars .
just as mentioned in the Sha@@ king Dragon Cl@@ assic , the stars are the greatest existence in the sky .
in this sense , like the ancient people , we also worship the sun , moon and stars .
and the peaks map onto stars .
in terms of geography , peaks are the most important , perfect , iconic element .
they represent a metap@@ hysical approach and symbol@@ ization of geography .
however , this kind of symbol@@ ization finally evolved into metap@@ hysics in feng shui theory , which can be seen as either an error or another application .
we don &apos;t need to discuss geom@@ antic culture here .
but we can find out where the wisdom of ancient people comes from .
OK , let &apos;s have a brief summary .
you see in this short book , Yong Gong has extracted the essence of the rare books he brought out from the imperial palace .
all of them were summarized in this thin book .
actually , we can put it in other words to make it more relevant to Chinese geography , to make it simpler , more accessible , more effective and more readily available .
it can be simplified into three words - sof@@ tness , regularity and aggregation .
as for sof@@ tness , it means when we choose a place to live , it should have thick soil layer , abundant vegetation and water .
in the field of geography , Chinese geography in particular , sof@@ tness also means z@@ ig@@ z@@ ags .
many people in the community of Chinese feng shui theory would tell you that z@@ ig@@ z@@ ag is sentimental while strai@@ ghtness is the opposite .
yes , that &apos;s right .
there are quite a few artistic elements in Chinese geography .
such artistic elements are not only an embodiment of data , but also arouse our sentiment .
therefore , sof@@ tness is very important as it represents sentiment .
as we just mentioned , regularity means safety .
the less the ground shakes , the longer it stays stable , the easier the mountain or the land becomes symmetrical and neat .
and such terrain provides us with clear targets , symbols or marks when we analyze its geom@@ ancy .
without the need of further analysis , we only have to know that this is an auspicious place .
the third word is aggregation .
the Sha@@ king Dragon Cl@@ assic mentioned many kinds of great environmental conditions , which can be aggregated together .
take Beijing as an example .
Beijing is a typical place with great environment , where there are mountains in the back , rivers in the front and plains in the middle .
these all are the best environmental conditions described in the Sha@@ king Dragon Cl@@ assic .
through this book , I hope you can understand why I &apos;m standing here today .
here we are at T@@ n@@ Dao , and are you all here for Tao ?
but the book indeed talks about Tao , just like the saying in the Tao T@@ e Ching goes , &quot; Man takes his law from the Earth ; the Earth takes its law from Heaven ; Heaven takes its law from the Tao . the law of the Tao is its being what it is . &quot;
nowadays people who learn Tao will skip the whole middle process to directly arrive at man being what it is .
on the contrary , our ancestors from Lao Zi to Yang Gong , and all scholars who study geography sincerely want to set the focus of our research first on the earth , which corresponds to &quot; man takes his law from the Earth . &quot;
even if we don &apos;t have profound needs , I hope we can think one more question .
in today &apos;s society , we impart wealth to our children .
what our society impart to our children can be either wealth or culture .
the question is , can we impart to them a beautiful , liv@@ able earth where they can survive and prosper generation after generation ?
I hope you all think hard about this question .
thank you !
hello everyone !
my topic today is optimism , and I &apos;ll primarily answer two questions .
first , why is being optimistic a responsibility ?
what are the reasons behind ?
second , how can we make ourselves optimistic ?
how can we assume such a responsibility ?
as for the first question , my opinion is that optimism as a responsibility comes from our judgment about our current and future situations .
a judgment must be justified by reasons , so must the optimism as a responsibility .
but do we have reasons to be optimistic ?
young people may argue that they are being pres@@ sured by the exor@@ bit@@ ant house prices , low incomes , fierce competition for school , and moreover , the difficulties in finding a job .
the elder may cite the environmental pollution , corruption of officials , vul@@ gar@@ ity of culture and fic@@ kle society when they claim that optimism is impossible .
people may say , ok , I admit optimism is a responsibility , and I never think about sh@@ ir@@ king it .
but the problem is , I just can &apos;t feel optimistic .
is there any method to cheer me up ?
indeed , there are so many things to th@@ wart our optimism .
but can we find an approach to being more light @-@ hearted ?
the first advice I will give is that , always remember that &quot; Things don &apos;t always turn out the way we want , but what you dwell upon you become . &quot;
living in this world , we have to answer three questions : what can we gain ? what must we do ? and who do we want to be ?
the morality cultivation would place &quot; what to do &quot; first .
but in actual life , we tend to identify what to do as what to gain .
for example , if someone che@@ ats in academic research , or ev@@ ades taxation in business , his major concern will be whether he will be caught and punished , and what penalties he will face .
if an official is refusing bribes and doing a good job in enforcing laws , what he considers most might be whether his performance will impress the public or his superi@@ ors , and whether there will be a possible promotion .
you see , all of them identify what to do as what to gain .
the thing is , when such confusion occurs , something fundamental is missing : who do we want to be ?
we might do this or that and get away with it .
but there is an omni@@ present judge : ourselves .
sometimes the good or evil may not get their due requ@@ it@@ als .
but if you want to be good , you can always preserve your integrity against all odds .
if you just pam@@ per little evils , you may sink into degeneration whatever admon@@ itions you receive .
my second advice is that we must distinguish between categories and learn to shift our perspectives .
category is an important object in philosophical study , and also a crucial tool for us to think .
we use categories to analyze and study .
take corruption for example .
what makes us especially pessimistic is the corruption prevalent in our society .
it is irritating and seems inv@@ incible .
our powerless feelings might easily turn into pessimism .
why do we feel powerless ?
because there are so many things that are underlying corruption , such as economic transformation , diversified values , temptation of profits , malicious maneu@@ vering , loop@@ holes of regulations , poor supervision , bad traditions , and a societal lack of morality .
with so many factors at work , how long exactly will it take to eradicate corruption ?
there are good reasons for our anxiety .
and corruption aside , we are also worrying about ourselves .
what if , as time goes on , we ourselves are dragged into degeneration too ?
I &apos;d like to answer the question from the perspective of sheer logic of thinking .
when we are aware that so many factors are incur@@ ring corruption , have we ever thought that those factors are actually causes , not reasons , for corruption ?
what &apos;s the difference between causes and reasons ?
causes are sure , or very likely , to lead to a result . they are independent from our own will .
reasons , however , only apply to our intentional behavior .
they have to be approved by our will first if they want to work on us .
so if we use the causes to justify our corruption , we are to a large degree treating ourselves as a mere link on the cause @-@ and @-@ effect chain , which allows us no right to choose and no chance to let our free will work .
that easily results in our corruption .
if we let corruption occur in that way , we are actually degrading ourselves , for we are denying the fact that we can choose and we have a free will .
in short , there might be hundreds of causes for corruption , but we never have a reason to yield to it .
with that in mind , we will never have to worry about whether we ourselves will get corrupted too .
if all those who det@@ est corruption can see that , then perhaps the entire sense of morality of our society might change for the better .
about that vision we should be more optimistic .
so this is an example of distinguishing categories , which helps us catch a gl@@ int of hope even in the darkness of de@@ jection , and see the silver lining on a cloud .
I want to give another example .
suppose there are two men , both of whom were once homeless for a while in early youth .
but when they grew up , one became a writer , while the other ended up being a prisoner .
we may infer that , the same experience of being once homeless must have different meanings for the two .
they must be drastically different .
and why are we sure about that ?
because what happens to a person later will give his or her prior experiences a special meaning .
that reminds me of how Steve Jobs once put it : collecting the dots .
life is full of experiences which are like dots that will form a line . the meaning of a prior occurrence depends on how we would link it with a future occurrence , and how we would collect those dots .
that explains why we have reasons to be optimistic .
even if something terribly regrettable , or some disastrous event like what we &apos;ve experienced , happens , its meaning will not be limited , but rather , open @-@ ended .
a thing never just happens . it keeps coming around edi@@ fying us .
think about the mem@@ o@@ irs or bi@@ ograp@@ hies we read .
those containing an absurd and disp@@ ir@@ ited youth are always more to our taste .
that &apos;s not because we want to imitate the heroes &quot; absur@@ dity , or appreciate their decad@@ ency .
the real reason is that they overturn their absurd and decad@@ ent earlier years by rising to success later in life .
there is another example , which once attracted wide media coverage . some tourist from China scri@@ b@@ bled his name on a relief of Egypt &apos;s Lux@@ or Temple ,
we all felt regre@@ tful and ashamed about that .
but actually the thing has not ended .
its meaning will largely depend on the performance of Chinese tourists in foreign countries in the future ten or twenty years .
if one or two decades on , that day finally comes when China is exporting the most civilized tourists of the world , then maybe , this humiliating gr@@ aff@@ iti incident might even be mentioned as an anec@@ dote .
with this in mind , we have reasons to be optimistic
we should have faith and strive for the arrival of that day !
that is how I understand optimism . it is a responsibility , and also a piece of wisdom .
thank you !
I do not have a microphone with me .
does this make me different from other speakers ?
but I have brought a smart@@ phone , and I believe all of you have one in your pocket .
as the cell@@ ist has just pointed out , technology can sometimes be unreliable .
on the contrary , I think I can count on our smart@@ phones as well as We@@ Chat .
thank you !
well , I am very delighted to be invited to speak on the stage of T@@ n@@ Dao .
on this special day of Double Ninth Festival , I would like to take this opportunity to extend my greetings to all of your parents .
thank you !
this is my first time standing here as a speaker .
let me start with a special introduction .
please open We@@ Chat on your smart@@ phones .
choose &quot; + &quot; at the right upper corner in the interface of Cont@@ acts , select &quot; Add Cont@@ acts , &quot; and then enter my name &quot; Guan Peng . &quot;
I was pretty nervous as I listened to the first speaker .
and I define myself as someone obsessed with social medi@@ as such as T@@ enc@@ ent Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat .
I have sent over 60 thousand Wei@@ bo posts and therefore accumulated some two million followers .
besides , I also enjoy sharing things on We@@ Chat moments .
today , I will give you an insight into the magic of We@@ Chat .
this is a test I launched on We@@ Chat moments .
by pulling down the page , I now show you the We@@ Chat profile image of those who have given a like .
those sitting in the front might get a clearer look at these friends on my We@@ Chat .
guess how many friends I have on my We@@ Chat .
over ten thousand , well , over twelve thousand .
I just want to tell you how We@@ Chat is associated with you influence and connections .
today , I will share with you my understanding of We@@ Chat .
my story with this We@@ Chat goes back several years ago .
on January 21 , 2011 , the day when We@@ Chat was first released , I downloaded this app .
I am the 11.@@ 2 thous@@ and@@ th user of this product which boasts millions of users .
in August 2011 , having experienced the wonders of this social media , I wrote an article titled We@@ Chat Hol@@ ds the Pot@@ ential to Bec@@ ome a New Giant in the Internet Industry .
today , We@@ Chat has really become a new giant in the Internet industry .
I am also very proud of my prediction .
looking back at the history of We@@ Chat , I can now outline several points .
first , We@@ Chat improved our communicating method during the time when communication could only be realized with pure textual content .
before that , we can only send text messages or texts to our friends .
We@@ Chat has enabled us to send images , videos and voice messages to our friends , forming a closer tie among different individuals .
We@@ Chat has also integrated different features .
take &quot; People N@@ ear@@ by &quot; for exam@@ pl@@ em , by virtue of this function , you can easily make friends with strangers nearby .
however , what is the most powerful feature on your smart@@ phone for your connections ?
it is your phone number .
it is through your phone number that you first make connections with those who are familiar to you through We@@ Chat .
therefore , you can only see your acquaintances in We@@ Chat moments and We@@ Chat Cont@@ acts .
your telephone number is the key connector of your relationship .
only after you have met or called someone will you keep his / her phone number .
in addition to its multi @-@ purpose feature , W@@ ech@@ at has also integrated some recreational features .
as we all know , We@@ Chat has a very cool function .
what is it ?
&quot; shake , &quot; that is it .
the &quot; Sha@@ ke &quot; feature is multi @-@ purpose , aside from adding new friends by shaking your smart@@ phone , if you have installed Chro@@ me plug @-@ in on We@@ Chat 4.5 , you can shake a picture on your smart@@ phone onto this screen .
apart from this , we were just now actually listening to a concert , if you are listening to a concert or a music , you can see the lyrics on the screen of your smart@@ phone by taking advantage of the &apos; Sha@@ ke &quot; feature .
it is pretty amazing .
I wonder if you have noticed that the movement of shaking is actually the most simple instinc@@ tive action in human cognition .
I just have to move a bit .
actually , the &apos; Sha@@ ke &quot; functionality is quite poetic .
as I stand on the stage of &quot; T@@ n@@ Dao , &quot; what impres@@ ses me the most is a sense of art , this is the first time I have ever sensed such a strong artistic vi@@ be .
actually , the &apos; Sha@@ ke &quot; functionality also exhibits a vibrant aesthetic sensibility .
initially , it features Venus de Mil@@ o on its interface .
afterwards , some argued that Venus is not appropriate , so the We@@ Chat Team subsequently replaced it with a flower .
in fact , We@@ Chat typ@@ i@@ fies arts .
as you all know , a song is added into We@@ Chat 4.5 .
what was it ?
it was Nothing to My Name sung by Cu@@ i Jian , which was itself an artistic move .
furthermore , We@@ Chat has linked people together through a Q@@ R code and it interconnected various channels .
for example , we can use it to add new friends .
just now I asked a guest downstairs for his We@@ Chat ID .
after he showed me his Q@@ R code , I can add him into my We@@ Chat contacts by scanning his Q@@ R code .
today , as I entered the door of this building , I saw the Q@@ R code of T@@ n@@ Dao .
after following its official account on We@@ Chat by scanning the code , I got to know that many of our appointments and our sign @-@ ups were actually realized through their official account .
we connected the online and offline through the Q@@ R code that serves also as a key to a door .
then we will have some new discoveries .
for example , we have spotted in the subway stations of Beijing many ven@@ ding machines .
what makes such ven@@ ding machines exceptional is that each product carries a Q@@ R code .
after you scan the Q@@ R code on U@@ box ven@@ ding machine with you We@@ Chat , you could finish you payment in We@@ Chat and choose your beverage or other products , then it will fall off the shelf .
another example is a printer called Wel@@ om@@ o .
after you connect the printer with We@@ Chat by scanning the official account of Wel@@ om@@ o , you could then upload a picture on you phone onto the account and the printer will start printing your picture .
during later part of my speech , I will show you a case in which we used We@@ Chat to control a box .
what else ?
apart from Q@@ R code , during the development of We@@ Chat , there is a feature that attracts all of us .
what is it ?
We@@ Chat moments !
maybe you will find your friends &apos; We@@ Chat moments active , you have seen my We@@ Chat moments just now , is it amazing ?
we can communicate with our friends though We@@ Chat moments .
in addition , living in a mobile Internet time , people grow increasingly concerned with their personal privacy .
many are more willing to share things in We@@ Chat moments than on Wei@@ bo .
the reason is simple : if you send a post in Wei@@ bo , everybody can see it .
however , if you share things in We@@ Chat moments , only your friends can see them and only your shared friends can see the comments .
that &apos;s why just now there was a post in my We@@ Chat moments that has been viewed by a thousand or so of my contacts , but this post has only read by a few .
this is their difference .
after We@@ Chat moments was launched , another feature that could better cater to the needs of enterprises was rolled out , namely ‎ We@@ Chat Official Account .
it was unveiled on August 18 , 2012 .
by virtue of We@@ Chat official account , we can attract our own subscribers and everyone can become a we media .
just now I asked you to follow my We@@ Chat official account by entering &quot; Guan Peng . &quot;
you will find that I have been writing and this is my personal self @-@ media .
taking advantage of this form of w@@ eme@@ dia , I can make some new friends online while sharing my ideas .
so I recommend all of you to follow the We@@ Chat official account and open one in an effort to build your own W@@ eme@@ dia .
you can enter &quot; Register &quot; in my We@@ Chat official account to see the registration process .
similarly , as a small gift for you , you can enter &quot; Business card &quot; in my We@@ Chat official account to obtain my business card .
besides , the second tab that pop@@ s up will teach you how to make a business card of your own in 5 minutes .
thank you .
so as you can see , there are something interesting about these We@@ Chat features .
take We@@ Chat Road Condi@@ tion for example , a project in which I participated only a short while ago .
you can follow its official account by in@@ putting the pin@@ yin of &quot; We@@ Chat Road Condi@@ tion . &quot;
in a congestion @-@ stricken city as Beijing , you can gain a glimpse of traffic conditions around you by sending a location in the We@@ Chat official account .
when you are driving , you could open this official account that will remind you of the distance of traffic lights ahead .
this is an interesting application that can be realized through a simple W@@ ech@@ at official account .
what else ?
as you may found out , when we are checking in for our flights , if we follow the official account of China Southern Airlines and Eastern Mil@@ es , we could get our boarding pass and choose our seat after in@@ putting our identity number , finally we will get a Q@@ R code .
in major cities like Beijing and Guangzhou , you can board with just a Q@@ R code , which is fascinating .
earlier in my speech , I have talked about mobile payment in sub@@ ways .
another thing I want to talk about is the We@@ box which is also a project I participated in .
We@@ box is a solution to the internet of things of We@@ Chat .
by scanning the box using We@@ Chat , you can control intelligent appliances in you home .
when you enter 25 ° C , the temperature of the air conditioner will drop to 25 ° C .
if you want to turn off the lights , the We@@ box can do it .
maybe sometimes you are not at home and you want to have some rice cooked before you arrive home .
you could in this case use the feature in We@@ box to choose and open your electric cooker in the options of We@@ box , the cooker will then start cooking with the water and rice in it .
these are all we have achieved for now .
what I want to say is that there are so many wonders in We@@ Chat .
at the same time , I consider We@@ Chat as an industry solution that has genuinely solved various problems in our daily life .
finally , I want to tell all who are present that We@@ Chat also serves as a high end medium that helps you build your connections .
I did something interesting on September 3 , as you all know I have over 10 thousand We@@ Chat friends from different places around the world , so I found an organization named &quot; K Friends Association . &quot;
why is it called &quot; K Friends Association &quot; ?
this is because my pseud@@ onym is &quot; Old K , &quot; and many friends call me &quot; Old K. &quot;
therefore , my friends are K friends .
this is the very background of &quot; K Friends Association . &quot;
I believe many audiences who are here today are members of &quot; K Friends Association . &quot;
could you please raise your hand ?
well , I cannot see you because of the darkness .
but I believe there are many K friends here .
only after a month , &quot; K Friends Association &quot; has established 13 We@@ Chat groups , each consisting of 300 K friends .
in addition , We have gathered group administrators from 180 places worldwide .
the groups come with strict rules .
members should in the first place take initiative to share .
then they should conform to the group rules , such as no politics , no loads of off @-@ topic t@@ reads , no content with only stic@@ kers and no voice messages .
in a large group of 300 people , sending messages too frequently would har@@ ass other members .
thanks to the support of our friends , K Friends Association has experienced break@@ neck growth .
aside from these 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 and 13 groups , we have also built We@@ Chat groups of members from different places of China .
I argue that because we have friends sprink@@ led all over the country , you might feel alone in a We@@ Chat group , but never will you feel lonely .
when you travel to a place in China , we have a local director of the &quot; K Friends Association &quot; who would share interesting things with you .
as a result , I have come to realize that we have been acquainted with many new friends through organizations like &quot; K Friends Association . &quot;
two days ago , along with other dozens of members of the association , we participated in an activity organized by K Friends Association .
during the activity , I made many new friends .
besides , the launch ceremony of the banner of &quot; K Friends Association &quot; will kicked off on 18 at Changsha Electronic Commerce Conference , another significant event for us .
the banner of &quot; K Friends Association &quot; was therefore diff@@ used in 180 counties worldwide by our members around the world spontaneously .
we also organized some charitable activities by building the &quot; K Char@@ itable Foundation . &quot;
there will be no fund raising for our organisation .
our funds will be allocated to work with the Red Cross .
during the &quot; Yu@@ y@@ ao Event , &quot; we summoned many friends to participate in the K Char@@ itable Foundation .
in the next step , we will work with T@@ enc@@ ent Char@@ ity Foundation .
we hope to do some good with T@@ enc@@ ent Char@@ ity , we will go to orphan@@ ages and nursing homes to send them some care and small gifts .
backed by various We@@ Chat groups , we can gather caring friends from K Friends Association , in an effort to do something meaningful .
therefore , I think we should make good use out of We@@ Chat , we should learn to expand its value and make good friends on it .
as a matter of fact , I know that it was through the We@@ Chat official account of T@@ n@@ Dao that many friends who are here got an insight into the introduction to T@@ n@@ Dao and obtained the image @-@ text message that attracted you to sign up .
of course , special thanks should be given to T@@ n@@ Dao for it has given a channel for members of &quot; K Friends Association &quot; to sign up and communicate with each other through We@@ Chat .
it is my genuine wish that you should use We@@ Chat more effectively .
in the mean time , in our outlook for We@@ Chat , I believe that it will offer more solutions for different industries .
here is a simple example .
when visiting a tourist resort , we can obtain the tourist map simply by scanning the Q@@ R code .
a printed map therefore becomes unnecessary .
when you are at the tourist spot , by in@@ putting the name of it , you can get to know its introduction . this is very convenient .
if you want to see a movie , you can just send your location in a relevant We@@ Chat official account to see various cinemas around you such as IM@@ A@@ X .
then you get an idea of the more popular movies recently and reserve the tickets or choose the seats .
later , you will receive a series of We@@ Chat messages with which you can get the ticket in the cinema .
We@@ Chat has indeed changed the way we live .
I will soon take part in the publication process of some books on We@@ Chat .
such books will be available at airports and high speed railway stations .
the sponsor of T@@ n@@ Dao has asked me to build a We@@ Chat group of T@@ n@@ Dao &apos;s audiences in Beijing .
I feel it is my responsibility to offer support although the Internet connection does not seem to work well here .
now please switch to the interface of &quot; Dis@@ cover &quot; in your We@@ Chat and click &quot; Sha@@ ke . &quot;
you have one minute , for I have only one minute left on this stage .
please do not shake your smart@@ phones now , and you should wait for my command .
O@@ AK@@ Y ?
as you might know , we can also add friends through Friend Rad@@ er .
when you and your friends use feature simultaneously , you can add them to your Cont@@ acts .
however , in a single attempt , this feature can only allow you to add no more th@@ ant@@ 15 or 16 friends to your Cont@@ acts .
if you want to add more , &quot; Sha@@ ke &quot; is the only option .
after tapping &quot; Sha@@ ke , &quot; raise your phone over your head .
please do not shake your phone now , buddy .
I will count 3 , 2 , and 1 , let &apos;s shake together , okay ?
3 , 2 , 1 !
I have seen once over one thousand people shaking their phones together .
if your phone network works well , you can add each other into your Cont@@ acts .
however , the China Unicom &apos;s network does not seem to work well because my phone has not reacted yet .
fortunately , I have an another solution .
you can write down my We@@ Chat ID : 5@@ 28@@ 00 , a 5 @-@ digit Q@@ Q number .
you must enter &quot; T@@ n@@ Dao Beijing &quot; so that I could invite you to the right group .
if you cannot add friends by shaking your phone because of the ineffective network , as is the case with me .
you can add me by entering 5@@ 28@@ 00 until the network works well and I will accept your friend request .
now that I have more than ten thousand friends in my We@@ Chat Cont@@ acts , I will not be bothered by hundreds of people sending friends requests at the same time .
you must enter &quot; T@@ n@@ Dao Beijing &quot; while sending the friend request , so that I can invite you to the group of audiences of T@@ n@@ Dao in Beijing .
in addition , we also recommend you to follow the We@@ Chat official account of T@@ n@@ Dao Beijing : &quot; Beijing TD . &quot;
we will release information regarding T@@ n@@ Dao Beijing in this official account .
let me end my speech by extending thanks to the staff and sponsors of T@@ n@@ Dao for their contributions .
thank you very much !
the story started in 18@@ 94 in Guangzhou , at a world @-@ renow@@ n school named W@@ AN@@ M@@ U Cot@@ tage .
on a warm spring afternoon , a young man of 28 came to the door of the cottage .
he knocked at the door with hope , aspiration and a touch of tension , for he would like to get acquainted with the host that was also well @-@ known .
however , the host refused to meet him .
in the next few years , the young man tried every means to meet the politician who considered himself as &quot; a sage , &quot; but the politician still refused to meet him .
we never know how he felt on those occasions , for he didn &apos;t mention it for a single time in the rest of his life .
the &quot; Mr Big &quot; in the story is Kang You@@ wei , whom people called &quot; Nan Hai Xian Sheng . &quot;
and the young man who was denied entrance for several times is Sun Yat @-@ sen .
one cannot speak of the modern history of China without mentioning Sun Yat @-@ sen and Kang You@@ wei .
they only had eight years of age difference , but they never made it to be acquainted with each other .
Kang &apos;s refusal to see Sun was resulted partly from his political concerns and more from his arrogance .
in his mind , there was a great disparity between their knowledge .
sun Yat @-@ sen was not good enough for him , even as a student .
well , that opinion was considered wrong by the later generations .
most of us , actually , were like the young Sun Yat @-@ sen .
we tried to get acquainted with different people for our career or other things .
and the bitterness we had was just like the line described , &quot; At dawn I knocked at the gates of the rich , at dusk I chased the dust of plump horses . &quot;
but what difference will it make when we get to know them ?
you y@@ earn for hope , opportunity and affirmation .
but most of the time , the people you wish to know couldn &apos;t care less about you .
they give you the cold shoulder , as if you are a feel@@ ing@@ less statue .
they keep you waiting almost forever , as if your time isn &apos;t life .
however , after you gain money and power , those people will change from arrogance to humility .
and it &apos;s ironic that they deliberately forget the former attitudes towards you , as if they had am@@ nes@@ ia .
frankly , I fl@@ in@@ ched slightly when asked to give a speech on this subject .
do we need to know so many people ?
whatever my answer is , it is either il@@ liberal , one @-@ sided , or even stupid .
if I say the more people you know , the better .
you will definitely give me the tired faces .
if I say there is no need to know too many people , I am certainly getting myself into difficulties , for it sounds morally bankrupt .
and if I say we should only get us acquainted with helpful people , you will positively see me as an advocate of uti@@ lit@@ arianism and opportun@@ ism .
besides , I will be harsh@@ ly criticized on the Internet in the near future , what else do I expect from being a target ?
so what am I supposed to say ?
plenty of people popped into my mind .
for some of them , I can &apos;t remember their faces or names .
please forgive me .
but I think , I must be fading away in some people &apos;s memory as well .
why is it that some people could stay in our lives while others just pass by ?
maybe we should just see it from another perspective .
when discussing on the necessity of knowing so many people , we may temporarily put aside the question of &quot; necessity &quot; and &quot; how many &quot; and start from &quot; knowing . &quot;
I have two points here .
on one hand , knowing people is a bilateral behavior involving the agreement of both sides .
you should always get acquainted with people who deserve to be your friends , and meanwhile make sure that you deserve to be theirs .
some of my editor friends complained at the same time to me about being bothered on Q@@ Q .
a few contributors were so impatient after handing in their articles .
they kept asking whether their articles could be published and if there was something to modify , and even tried to tell editors their feelings in writing .
to quote from one of the editor : &quot; Oh , man ! will you please give me a break ? it has been only a few minutes and you are already asking for reviews . I am a professional and I can read quickly enough , but I still need time , right ? &quot;
so these editors become more careful in adding contacts , and their Q@@ Q are usually in the state of inv@@ isibility or off @-@ line .
the mood of the contributors is understandable .
however , they need to put themselves in the shoes of the editors , so that they will know how it feels to be frequently interrupted when concentrating on their work .
indeed , every writer cr@@ aves others &apos; appreciation .
but you need to give others &apos; a little time and space , for outstanding works will never be deserted or rejected .
instead , editors will follow you closely as if they had a crush on you .
same rules apply to other scenarios and circumstances .
I know another person who is a fre@@ elo@@ ader .
how ?
he fre@@ elo@@ ads celebrities and pseudo @-@ celebrities for group photos , dinners with outstanding figures and various flashing parties attended by media .
after all the time , though , his life hadn &apos;t changed .
the life experiences , patterns and the cultural literacy he y@@ earned for remained the same .
what he gained were merely the superficial glamour .
he became so tired .
judging from his experience , we could see that if you are not strong enough , the number of your contacts may have little thing to with whether you will get what you want .
the desire to control the outside world and the scenes of satisfaction or frustration are actually reflecting your inner world .
your capability determines the kind of people you associate with or compete with .
if you are not as brilliant as Nik@@ ola Tes@@ la , how can you challenge Edison ?
therefore , instead of seizing the superficial glamour eagerly , you &apos;d better cultivate yourself .
when you become strong enough , the people you always want to know will be attracted to your side , and you will also be able to properly step in every circle you thir@@ sted for before .
you don &apos;t have to feel skeptical about my words .
please show your faith in talent sc@@ outs .
they are as sensitive as Sher@@ lock Holmes , as smell @-@ sensitive as a hound and as agile as a gos@@ hawk .
so they definitely won &apos;t bl@@ under away any excellent spirit .
on the other hand , it &apos;s important to find out the person worthy of you and strike up a lasting and profound friendship .
in our lifetime , we have many chances to know others .
the Internet , for example , has help build numerous circles , undertakings and marriages since its advent .
it is ad@@ orable that miracles often happen where people gather .
but we have to admit the Internet is a double @-@ edged sword that also places burden on us .
of countless chatting sof@@ tw@@ ares and social platforms on the Internet , the new ones keep replacing the outdated ones .
and we just follow the trends and wander about , like the homeless G@@ yp@@ sy people .
when invited into some circle or group with tens or hundreds of people online , you can &apos;t think of anything to say , but silence will make people feel that you are hear@@ tless .
however , you don &apos;t delete and leave it for not hurting some fragile heart@@ .@@ Is@@ n &apos;t this awkward ?
I have a friend who is one extreme .
he only uses e @-@ mail and telephone call to contact others .
I asked him , &quot; Why don &apos;t you create an ID on some social software ? it could be fun . &quot;
&quot; those pop @-@ up messages annoy me a lot . &quot; he replied .
he added , &quot; I &apos;m always busy working . if I had plenty of time , I would rather read a classic book . if I had fragmented time , I would rather learn to make a dish or chat with my families . but what can a social software bring me ? trivial things in life , passages making a fuss about nothing , and sel@@ fies pre @-@ air@@ brushed to the extent that the skin texture is gone and their eyes are severely lique@@ fied . &quot;
it seems you share the same feelings with me .
&quot; isn &apos;t that a waste of time and self torture ? &quot;
his description is a little exaggerated , actually , for social platforms are not always full of those contents .
but there is still a grain of truth in it .
I &apos;m not something of a personality like him .
I &apos;m rather a common person who likes to get a sense of presence by showing off on the Internet .
this reminds me of those days I spent without Internet .
actually , I felt spirit@@ ually fulfilled during that time .
due to obvious reasons , I was isolated from the outside world for several years .
I used to sigh often , but when I recall it now , I start to miss those un@@ disturbed days .
in those years , I hardly had the chance to meet a stranger .
instead , I acquainted myself with quite a few immortal figures in books .
by the way , you don &apos;t always need to strike up a profound relationship with the alive , for spiritual friendship can also be fruitful .
Mr Mu Xin had two impressive remarks concerning his imprisonment .
one is &quot; I &apos;m a slave at daytime and a prince at night . &quot;
as for the other remark , I can only remember its general meaning , which is &quot; When I suffer and struggle , those people who had the same experience as me and who I adore so much will keep me company in hell . &quot;
after years of isolation when I got to contact the outside world , people &apos;s clothes , commodities &apos; prices and those cat@@ ch@@ words became unfamiliar to me , and even the air quality had changed .
the feeling I had was just like the line &quot; L@@ ess than an hour , but a world away . &quot;
since I returned to the outside world , I have made some mistakes , but I never felt embarrassed , for I have learnt to be composed from reading .
what kind of book you read is equal to what kind of person you know .
the classic master@@ pieces will never be obsolete and it &apos;s never a waste of time to read them .
a French scholar once said , &quot; We should trust the books our predecessors chose . a man might be wrong , a generation might be wrong , but the entire human race can &apos;t be wrong . &quot;
knowing someone is just like reading .
instead of gl@@ ancing over , you should per@@ use it .
this is both a profound and superficial era .
as for those who have a voice , they keep saying virtues and morality over and over , they be@@ w@@ ail the times and pity the people , and they point out problems and persuade people to correct them .
however , when it comes to practical issues , the character setting they designed for themselves will collapse in no time .
although there are un@@ discovered talents everywhere , most of the time , their words don &apos;t carry much weight .
so it is better to compose yourself and pay more attention to observation , learning and challenges than to frequently associate with and cater to others .
in this way , we will gain a profound understanding of the world , our thoughts can be inf@@ illed with originality and deep@@ ness , and we will definitely get the access to quality connections .
when discussing on today &apos;s speech with an elder man , he said , &quot; In each person &apos;s life , there are at most ten people , apart from family members , that are worthy of your interaction . &quot;
hearing his opinion , it crossed my mind to consider if he could be among the top ten friends of mine .
I will never tell him , of course .
it &apos;s just like that we will not , dare not and need not reveal the top ten list in our mind .
let &apos;s try to get into the top ten list of the person you &apos;d very much like to know with our kindness , wisdom and diligence .
meanwhile , maybe we can consider who are on the top ten list of our life .
thank you !
well , I think listening is sometimes a pleasure .
why didn &apos;t I listen when I was a child ?
I thought that people around me were always trying to force me to learn .
that was not much of a pleasure .
learning is not something you can force others to do .
they have to be willing to do that , right ?
and then I learned music , very reluctantly .
my parents were professors at the Central Conserv@@ atory of Music back in the early 1950s .
I did not choose to do this myself .
the reason why I has made a name in the circle of music education is because I know that I was at first not that into music when I am with kids , little or big . I myself is a kid in my mind .
honestly , in China , there are at least hundreds of thousands of kids learning to play an instrument , if there are not millions of them , but most of them do not really love music .
do you hear me ?
they are learning to play the instrument , but they do not like music .
it sounds ridiculous .
isn &apos;t my child learning music all the time ?
no , your kid is learning to play a instrument .
music is a different thing .
crafts and art are different .
what is art ?
it is the greatest distraction in life .
today , in this short speech , on this stage , I want to tell you that it is distraction , not concentration , that is the most beautiful thing in the world .
we don &apos;t need deliberate concentration .
it is useless .
things that you intentionally concentrate to learn are like dust , which can be easily blown off .
I will prove it with a piece of music .
it &apos;s chamber music , and it &apos;s for close appreciation .
we will perform un@@ plugg@@ ed , because I never believe in technology .
I believe that , although we are mess@@ ing around the internet , information or even some cosmic things , one day when people on this blue planet forget about electricity , music will still be there and these instruments will still make sound .
that is art .
we &apos;re going to play a well @-@ known piece composed by Johan@@ n P@@ ac@@ hel@@ bel , the teacher of the great European musician B@@ ach .
it &apos;s called Can@@ on .
I believe this is a name familiar to many of you .
let your mind wander .
don &apos;t listen intentionally .
I am neither good at listening nor any good at talking .
next is a sketch by Wag@@ ner , a great German composer .
this year marks the bic@@ ent@@ enary of Wag@@ ner &apos;s birth .
this is not the right place to talk about music , and I am not the right person to talk about it .
but when you boys interested in war history , and , of course , girls who are interested , watch docum@@ ent@@ aries about Nazi Germany during World War II , when you see the military par@@ ades , Nazi r@@ allies or bombers dropping bombs in@@ human@@ ely , you may notice that there is music on the background .
most of the music was written by Wag@@ ner .
I will run through it as quick as possible .
please bear with me for a while .
such music is banned in many places around the world , including Israel , because there are many old Jews who had listened to such music , not in chap@@ els or concert halls , but in the concentration camp .
although music is intangible , some@@ th@@ im@@ es it can be sharper than a knife , as it goes straight to your heart and your soul .
why are we playing Wag@@ ner for you today ?
well , there are two great pieces widely known as Wed@@ ding March in the world .
nod your head if you know them .
it &apos;s dark over there , but I can still see you .
I don &apos;t like a dark classroom .
it feels like watching a movie in a theater .
it &apos;s not good .
when the lights are on , you can only focus on me .
the first piece .
I am not a singer , but I can hum a bit of the melody .
I see a lot of no@@ ds .
thank you .
the second sounds more calm .
it is actually more famous .
thank you ! I saw a beautiful girl no@@ dding .
this is a well @-@ known piece all over the world .
it is the most beautiful Wed@@ ding March .
it came from the very talent of Wag@@ ner .
you see , art is innocent .
it can be an invisible weapon in the hands of the wicked , while in the hands of good people like us , being good as we do good things , music can lead us to another level of emotion , a palace of art .
now , we are playing for you Wag@@ ner &apos;s opera Lo@@ hen@@ grin .
another feature of our team is that I encourage students not to listen , and I encourage young people to be ta@@ ste@@ ful .
I think being ta@@ ste@@ ful is the best attitude toward life .
don &apos;t eat a whole fish and then ask others , &quot; do you know what &apos;s the best part of a fish ? &quot;
isn &apos;t this nonsense ?
does it even matter to you what others eat ?
we will present to you the best part of Wag@@ ner &apos;s five @-@ hour opera , which is like the ten@@ der@@ st piece behind fishes &apos; eyes .
if you search online , you can see that over the last nine years , Chu Yi@@ bing C@@ ello Music Trou@@ pe has presented nearly 300 welfare performances at different institutions and colleges .
we perform the master@@ pieces of western music , but not from big@@ inning to end .
I am not that patient .
we &apos;ll give you the best five minutes of the five @-@ hour opera .
if you listen carefully , you will find some clue of Wag@@ ner in the last few bars .
do you still remember the melody , Wed@@ ding March ?
please pay attention .
for example , as we are living a much better life now , some people go to Kenya &apos;s national parks , to pat rhin@@ os , to see lions sleeping laz@@ ily on the way .
they feel so happy to enjoy the blue sky .
not to mention there &apos;s no PM@@ 2.5 .
they are so happy and then they take out instant noodles that they bring from home .
you know , when you pour hot water in it , the smell takes away the atmosphere you spent hundreds of thousands of RMB creating .
it makes you feel like you &apos;re back home in an instant .
so the old saying of &quot; travelling thousands of miles brings wisdom &quot; does not make sense any more .
now wherever we go , we go with a mobile in hand with all sorts of mess@@ agers like We@@ Chat and Q@@ Q .
in fact , our oldest prophets knew that as soon as our emotions wandered into another space , we were travelers , explorers , and ram@@ bl@@ ers .
I would like to tell you in this short speech that music is alcohol for emotions .
if human hadn &apos;t invented alcohol , we would be a lot poorer .
of course , we cannot be drunk all day long .
especially the under@@ age youngsters like them cannot drink .
but they can learn music .
they can learn a kind of in@@ expl@@ icable touching , which is great for their health .
I started with music today , and I &apos;d like to end it with music .
let &apos;s enjoy a trip to Argentina in the emotional space .
Argentina ab@@ ounds in three things .
the first is silver , as indicated by the name Argentine meaning silver in Latin .
also , it has many football players like Mess@@ i , not very tall though .
thirdly , tang@@ o , which it exports to the world .
talking about dance we &apos;ll think of tang@@ o .
do you have a invisible picture in your mind ?
the last piece for you is a tang@@ o by Alber@@ to Gin@@ ast@@ era , a modern composer from Argentina .
it has an interesting name EL 58 .
we do not have to understand everything .
just listen and feel .
thank you !
hi , everyone !
I brought with me a bouquet of flowers on@@ stage , as you could see .
there &apos;re five flowers in total , symbol@@ izing the life of five beautiful children .
these five kids , lucky or not , their life are to me a wound of this era .
I want to tell people their tragic stories only to prevent similar tragedies from happening again in our country .
the girl in the first story , I think you all have noticed on the picture , her name was Li M@@ eng@@ x@@ ue .
despite the media called her &quot; The girl star@@ ved to death in Nanjing , &quot; she had a name , a very beautiful name , M@@ eng@@ x@@ ue .
I believe that her family must have named her with much love .
she had a sister named Li Tong .
M@@ eng@@ x@@ ue was three years old and Li Tong was one .
however , these two lovely little girls were found dead like mum@@ m@@ ies at home on June 21 this year .
the two little precious lives were sec@@ l@@ uded behind the cold iron door for good .
all this happened because of their mother , a drug addict .
she left her children at home alone for a month and she didn &apos;t care about them at all .
those desperate kids were st@@ ucked behind the iron door with no food or water .
they may have cried for help .
but all they got was silence .
it &apos;s heart@@ breaking for us to find out that for kids of their age , the two little girls have tried with their best knowledge and abilities to survive .
the three @-@ year @-@ old girl once managed to open the door and cried for help naked in the stair@@ way .
fortunately , they were found by neighbors .
neighbors found out that there were already mag@@ go@@ ts in their hair .
the younger one was so star@@ ved that she lived on excre@@ ment in the toilet .
that was the horrible situation when they were found .
people so@@ bbed and signed , many found it unacceptable .
then they were sent to hospital .
but they were sent back to their mother again afterwards .
their jun@@ kie mother rel@@ apsed only after one week , she had also cried and felt remorse for her behavior and she swe@@ ared to treat her kids well .
but she had already lost her human instincts and control .
this time she locked them in the bedroom and sealed the door with a di@@ aper .
this time , it was beyond Li M@@ eng@@ x@@ ue &apos;s ability to push open the door for help .
with a kettle of water , two dozens of cakes , the two little girls were actually died of thirst .
when Li Tong &apos;s little body was found , an empty glass was still firmly held in her tiny hands .
while the three @-@ year @-@ old Li M@@ eng@@ x@@ ue tried and tried in the endless despair and misery .
she hit the door with her little head , leaving locks of hair on the bedroom threshold .
the world answered them with dead stillness and silence .
on the day of June 21 , they were discovered .
I think you can relate to the pain the world feels .
but I want to as@@ ke what did the community , the neighbors and more important our country have done for them ?
how could such a tragedy happen in the 21st century ?
many people burst into tears when hearing the news .
but I &apos;m telling you , I didn &apos;t cry .
why ?
because I felt I was not qualified to cry .
only the two poor kids deserved to shed tears .
I didn &apos;t do anything for them as an adult , so I felt guilty .
also , all my tears had run dry 10 years ago .
was it just a random accident ?
was it just an incident ?
I don &apos;t think so .
I &apos;m going to tell you another story .
this flower is for a girl named Li Si@@ yi from Sichuan .
you could tell from the picture how pretty she was .
10 years ago , Li &apos;s mother was under detention for drug addiction , but the policeman who arrested her didn &apos;t perform his duty .
the mother kept begging the police officer saying that she had to take care of her child at home .
however , the police officer only called a relative one time , after not hearing anything for the relative , he completely forgot about this .
the three @-@ year @-@ old Li Si@@ yi was locked at home for 7 whole days in Chengdu .
she cried , begged , sought and shouted for help , but the world again answered her with silence .
deep scrat@@ ches were left by her tiny hands on the door .
that was her last cry for help , the time when she was found , she was already a dead body .
what cre@@ eps me out is that she was also found on June 21 , but ten years ago .
so , the day I saw the reports about Li M@@ eng@@ x@@ ue and Li Tong , I questioned myself .
I had cried my heart out ten years ago at night , do I have the right to shed tears now ?
what have I done during this ten @-@ year time ?
so I swore that night that I would devote all my ability and unite all necessary forces to fund a charity institution .
I decided to discard all pre@@ conception and fears and I want to push forward ac@@ amp@@ aign for the legislation of Chinese children &apos;s welfare .
I hope that one day tragedies like these would end once and for all .
here is the third story .
I was the witness in the story .
her name was Little Hope .
I believe many of you have come across this name in newspapers , as well as controversial voices .
in 2010 , I was a new mother and one day I saw a post online titled Stre@@ aming video of the death of a girl with ap@@ roc@@ tia in Tianjin .
I couldn &apos;t stand to look at such a horrible title so I clicked it .
it was about a baby girl diagnosed with ap@@ roc@@ tia and who was abandoned by her parents only ten days after her birth in Tian@@ jing .
her parents felt ashamed to have a baby with such an embarrassing disease .
the father threw her in a hosp@@ ice and insisted to give her no food and water so she could pass away fast .
despite all this , this baby demonstrated extraordinarily ten@@ acious vitality and survived for seven days , eight days and even nine days .
it was partly because a nurse couldn &apos;t bear to watch the baby die abandoned in misery and fed her some glucose .
the baby was so strong and survived 9 days .
during those 9 days , many people wanted to help her .
before me , a mother in Tianjin volunteered to vis@@ ite her in hospital and asked the president of the hosp@@ ice to take care of her .
someone called the police and one policeman said in tears to the baby &apos;s parents : &quot; if she were my child , I would do everything I could to save her . that &apos;s a precious life ! &quot;
workers of the Women &apos;s Federation came , &quot; We could try to talk with the parents , but if they insisted on giving up , our hands are tied . &quot;
some people even called the mayor for help .
people tried everything but the family was stubborn : &quot; no . we have the right to decide on her life . &quot;
do they really have the right to decide on the baby &apos;s life ?
on the ninth day , I flew from a village in Jiangxi to Beijing .
with four other volunteers , I arrived at Tianjin at night .
I knocked open the door of the hosp@@ ice and rushed up@@ stair@@ sand , spot@@ ting the poor baby in a shabby ward .
she was as skinny as a little mummy .
her arms were as tiny as matches .
I still remember that little face of her because she looked more like a dirty toll than a human .
however , she was still alive and made it to the ninth day , waiting for someone to save her .
I took her in my arms and my friend helped me holding back the doctors .
I dashed out of the hosp@@ ice and sent her to Beijing as fast as I could .
the baby girl received the treatment from a good hospital .
she was already suffered from extreme ac@@ id@@ osis , dehydration , malnutrition and newborn pneumonia .
she was alive but looked like a skeleton .
she still observed the world with an eager look , as you could tell from the picture of her taken on the fourth day by volunteers in the hosp@@ ice when she was struggling in pain for survival .
another picture of her was taken at the hospital in Beijing after the two @-@ day treatment , and her big eyes were shining and smiling .
do you know ?
she could smile .
I meant it when I promised her , &quot; Baby girl , you are safe now and I would do anything to protect you . &quot;
but was that true ?
can I really protect the kid ?
her father and uncle got to the hospital with the help of police .
the first thing they said at the hospital was , &quot; We want you to discharge her , I have the right to do so , we are the guardians and the baby is ours . &quot;
one mother volunteer locked herself and the baby up in the ward for the parents were about to rush in to take the baby .
she held Little Hope and shouted to the men outside the door , &quot; If you dare to break in , I would rather jump out of the window with her . she is going to die anyway ! &quot;
thanks to our persistence , the baby was safe with us that night .
but 7 days later , they came back and this time , they came back with two dozens of men with masks and they took with them an ambulance .
they had the baby discharged and took her away .
no one stop them this time .
we called the police and the hospital tried also .
experts from the Health Ministry warned them , &quot; What you are doing is against the law ! &quot;
but they brought lawyers this time , claiming their have custody .
a volunteer even attempted to stop them from taking the baby by lying down in front of the vehicle .
we tried everything in vain , no one could stop it and she was taken away .
on March 25 , they claimed in an interview that they were taking good care of the baby with quality di@@ apers and pow@@ dered milk . they said that everything was fine with her and people should worry no more .
but few months later , volunteers discovered through investigation that the child &apos;s death certificate was issued on March 27 , three days after she was taken away .
they were lying to the media .
why did the girl die ? how did she die ?
at her last moment , what was on her mind ?
has she called my name ?
I &apos;ve been keeping asking the same question for the past two years .
because I hugged her and I loved her .
I promised her that she would be safe and I think she knew .
I wonder if she was searching for those mom@@ s who have held her , loved her and kissed her .
where were those voices and eyes , where were those mothers ?
mothers should be the guardian angel for their children and the family should be their protec@@ tor .
when a mother fails at her duty and the family becomes a sem@@ inary of vice , when a sweet cradle becomes the claw of demons , what should the children do ?
researches showed that over 40 % of children have gone through domestic abuses of different degrees in Shanghai .
data given by S@@ ina demonstrated that nearly 70 % of children have reported physical and mental abuses .
seeing all these staggering figures , can we live with our useless Law on Protection of Min@@ ors ?
the 21st century is hailed as a golden era as a result of comprehensive children welfare protection legisl@@ ations in most countries in the world .
we are the only country that , to this date in 20@@ 13 , has no children welfare protection law in place .
we could only convict child ab@@ users of three crimes .
one is abuse crime which entails 7 years at most in prison .
if a family abuses a child to death in a cruel way , they will not get more than 7 years .
some would say what if we charge them with intentional murder rather than abuses ?
the girl floating on the water just now , was a baby drown to death in Jiang@@ ning , Nanjing .
this infant was thrown in the river by her father and grandfather the moment she was born just because she was a premature baby .
despite that she was evaluated as very healthy , they drowned her .
could you imagine what kind of punishment the two men received in the end ?
two years only . two years for the father and two for the son .
a father and son put two newborn baby boys in black plastic bags and dumped them in a river in Huang@@ pu district , Guangzhou .
they did so just because they suspected the boys had cerebral pal@@ sy .
the abandoned babies were found two hours later , one suffoc@@ ated and the other still alive .
sadly , the boy died from severe brain damage not long after the treatment .
how many years did they get ?
three years of imprisonment with four years in suspension .
according to their defense lawyer , I believe that someday this case would be recorded as a classic negative example in history .
he said , &quot; Although the father and son killed these two infants , considering the fact that the victims were of minor social existence value and had a rather weak ability to sense the pain , they deserve a len@@ ient sentence . &quot;
I debated online with a bunch of judges , lawyers and procur@@ ators .
what was horri@@ fying was that some of them were supportive of such sentences .
they believed that killing one &apos;s own child showed less subjective mal@@ ice , hence limited social hazard .
for God &apos;s sake , for any nation , killing one &apos;s families and infants is the cruel@@ est and most inhuman crime .
one who commits the cruel crime of killing his / her own baby or families would stop at nothing .
what else could be more detrimental to the social ethics and morality ?
what else could be more hur@@ tful to our feelings ?
unfortunately , during my research , I found hundreds of similar cases with a light sentence .
this was not a particular case but a fact .
except for the cases that caught the eye of the media and severe punishment was imposed .
countless cases of infanti@@ cide , murders and child abuse only ended up imprisonment of no more than three or four years .
what is the sc@@ ari@@ tism here ?
I don &apos;t get it .
therefore , this flower is for the drown baby girl , as well as other numerous poor children suffered from the same fate .
everyone , there &apos;s sunshine in this world and I am going to tell you what miracles can be created with love .
the name of this girl is Hong X@@ uan .
do you know that she was born blind ?
her fate was more miserable than other kids when she was born , for she was abandoned at birth by her parents .
luckily , she was adopted by a couple of kind farmers , but soon she was diagnosed with gli@@ ob@@ la@@ stom@@ a .
this kind of tumor deterior@@ ates quickly and it cannot be cured .
she would lose her sight anytime soon and she had to go through chemotherapy and major sur@@ ger@@ ies .
her poor adopted parents , they chose to sold their house and everything to treat this adopted child , despite of the fair chance of her recovery .
this couple touched many people and received lots of help and attention .
the little girl survived the low @-@ cure @-@ rate cancer finally .
now she is 7 years old .
she calls me &quot; aunt &quot; and stayed with me for a while .
because of love , a precious life abandoned in the garbage eventually spark@@ led bright lights .
although she is blind , she is a lovely girl full of aspirations .
her mother used to worry a lot about her life since she was blind .
I told her , &quot; Hom@@ er was the great poet I admire in the world and he was blind . it doesn &apos;t matter that much if one cannot see with his or hers eyes , what is important is that our souls have wings to fly . &quot;
Hong@@ x@@ uan is attending a school for the blind in Shanghai and she will keep learning all the way to college .
and she will live a happy and unique life .
next I want to talk about what we should do .
the day the two little girls died in Nanjing , I swore to found a charity organization .
I wanted to change the society we live in .
so I established this &quot; Home for Little Hope . &quot;
we have only three tasks .
one , we push forward the legislation of children welfare protection .
two , we pursue constantly the questionable sentence of all child abuse cases .
three , we offer help , service and assistance .
since its fun@@ d@@ ation in June , &quot; Home of Little Hope &quot; now has over 300 active members , some of them are here with us tonight .
they gave me great support in the past three months .
I &apos;d like to thank them all by saying that I love you guys because we have a mutual love for the children .
all this is not for the children but ourselves .
a man with tragic and traumatic childhood would revenge twice as much the society for the harm he or she received .
the high crime rate , broken families and traumatic souls will ulti@@ mat@@ ly lead to the tragedy of our world .
I once wrote , &quot; If the whole era became a tragedy , no one would step down the stage with a smile as we all are part of the tragedy . &quot;
so , what we do for this kids are not just for them but also for ourselves , for everyone of us .
will you join us ?
now I &apos;d like to give the stage to these children .
thank you for your presence in T@@ n@@ Dao !
you can see the first page of my P@@ PT .
it is a red brick .
as the first speaker today , I hope I can throw a spr@@ at to catch a mac@@ ke@@ rel .
I know for whom you are here today .
for a sweet piece of jade , right ?
but I &apos;m a brick and I love things like bricks .
look at this brick , doesn &apos;t it have a special spirit ?
seeing it , we probably get a sudden urge to throw it at someone .
it is not only the tot@@ em of do@@ ers like us , but also a multi @-@ t@@ asking hero .
it can build a house and can be a tool to hit others .
so the brick represents a spirit of the new era , a power of action , and an urge of a sudden .
well , what is the theme of my speech today ?
not Re@@ ady Yet .
and what do I mean ?
procrast@@ ination .
I think everyone here has procrast@@ ination issues , right ?
from writing compositions in school to writing files in companies , or making p@@ pts to clients and giving speeches on the stage , procrast@@ ination has le@@ ech@@ ed its way into our lives at some point .
I &apos;m going to tell you the reason I come here today .
this is all because of Jiang Chang@@ jian , a famous host .
we invited him a long time ago to prepare a speech for T@@ n@@ Dao , but he prepared for two whole years .
we invited him again , &quot; Mr. Jiang , are you ready ? &quot;
&quot; eh , I &apos;m not ready yet . &quot;
then , he ended up ready for The Brain .
yet as we can see from Mr. Jiang , winner of the &quot; Best Deb@@ ater &quot; title in the first International Var@@ s@@ ity Deb@@ ate in Singapore , is caught up in a vortex of &quot; not ready yet . &quot;
what are we facing and what are we afraid of ?
just now , Qin Chang said that I used to be a magazine editor @-@ in @-@ chief .
one of the things that happened to me a lot in this career was that many writers procrast@@ inated until the deadline roared toward them .
actually , I was an editor @-@ in @-@ chief of a music magazine .
I remember there was a famous music re@@ viewer , and his writing was very good .
so I invited him to write an article .
but when the deadline came , we call it &quot; deadline &quot; because we are so dead if writers do not turn in their works , for I would be unable to print the magazine .
so I called him , but he didn &apos;t answer the phone .
I looked for him by all means , and finally I caught up with him in the middle of the night , and he said , &quot; Sorry , Jian Fang , my wife has breast cancer . &quot;
I said well , your wife &apos;s life is much more important .
it &apos;s okay , just go and take care of her .
finally , I had to select another article to make up for this .
I thought what kind of editor @-@ in @-@ chief am I , and why did I bring such bad luck to him ?
I can &apos;t ask for his writings anymore , otherwise his life ......
you know it &apos;s not true , right ?
in fact , he is br@@ ill@@ ant and is never a man who has nothing to write .
he just got a disease called procrast@@ ination , which we all suffer from to a degree .
so what is it that makes us so fearful and keeps us from fulfilling our promises ?
okay , look at this word , it is a very big &quot; I. &quot;
we are afraid of ourselves , the one that we can see in the mirror after washing our faces every day .
it is known that there is a Buddhist term called &quot; ego@@ centr@@ ism . &quot;
as human beings , it is hard for us to free ourselves from ego@@ centr@@ ism .
we may get caught up in pursuing money , in focusing too much on our children , or in a certain kind of love , but the hardest for us is to lift us out of and above ourselves .
we often have a kind of fear , just as a Chinese proverb goes , &quot; To tell a horse from a mu@@ le , just pull it out and walk it awhile . &quot;
we should be such a horse with the style of Mr. Jiang .
but sometimes we may doubt ourselves .
we may think that I am not ready yet , I am not handsome enough , I still have fat on my waist , or other reasons to prove that we are not ready yet .
so what exactly are we afraid of ?
what we fear is our true selves .
but the shortcomings of the so @-@ called true self may actually be magni@@ fied by our fear .
&quot; to tell the difference between a horse and a mu@@ le , just walk them . &quot;
you hope to be a horse , an ideal horse , handsome , popular , respected , and having a good image in other &apos;s eyes .
but the truth is , deep down in your heart , you always feel like you &apos;re going to make a fool of yourself .
this fear holds you so tightly that you keep saying &quot; I &apos;m not ready yet . &quot;
yes , this could be what the procrast@@ ination fundamentally concerns about .
but as we are here today , we should look higher .
you can have a read of Pro@@ cra@@ st@@ ination : why You Do It , What to Do About It Now , a really nice book .
as modern people , we suffer from the so @-@ called inner fear caused by self @-@ reflection , but should we have a higher wisdom beyond our ourselves ?
in other words , how do we accept the imperfect self and the imperfect present ?
we can win by taking action from now on .
there is a wisdom called &quot; 2 versus 1 &quot; or &quot; 2 out of 3 , &quot; which means to win three out of five or two out of three .
we all know the Tian Ji &apos;s Horse Rac@@ ing Strategy .
all types of his horses , the superior ones , the average ones and the inferior ones are all weaker than that of the King Wei .
so they lost all three races .
what did Tian Ji do ?
he used his inferior horse to race with the king &apos;s best horse , his average horse to race with the king &apos;s inferior horse , and his best horse to race with the king &apos;s average horse .
so he won two races out of three and finally he won .
with the development of Internet digi@@ tization , it seems completely natural for us to make mistakes , so we don &apos;t have to pursue absolute perfection in our work and life .
we can even get an inspiration from such an old story , i.e. , we are horses , but we are Tian Ji &apos;s horses .
what can we learn from this inspiration ?
a superior rationality .
General rationality means courage and hard work .
it is like many Chinese parents who ask their children to get high scores in Chinese , Ma@@ ths , English , even all subjects , right ?
but in today , many smart people have discovered a truth from the story of Tian Ji .
they found that we can strategically give up something .
I can use my inferior horse to race with the king &apos;s best horse .
so in this case , my move is strategic , smart , and offensive .
then , we need to seek comparative advantages rather than absolute advantages .
is there anyone know about this girl ?
who is she ?
she is Ma Ji@@ aj@@ ia .
have you ever been to her shop ?
well , many people including her classmates said that she is not a big deal .
they think S@@ mar@@ Tao , a shop run by their other two classmates , is much better than hers .
yes , we have to admit that Ma Ji@@ aj@@ ia &apos;s shop is worse than S@@ mar@@ Tao when it comes to the size of shop , the suppliers and services .
but the girl bravely dressed herself up like this , encouraging people to enjoy sexual health products which traditionally embarrassed people to speak out .
when you talk about the shop size , the business , and the costs , she tells you about the spiritual realm .
she has byp@@ assed your old path and the old rules of price comparison , and has carved a new path .
that is the comparative advantage I just said .
I can say that no one in China has been more successful than her in the traditional field of sexual medic@@ are .
many have questioned her for the low sales , but she has marketing power , a new term .
if there is a far @-@ sighted person who can help her build a sound , mature logistics system , she will generate great business value .
another example , Huang Tai@@ ji , a small fast food restaurant specializing in Chinese panc@@ ake , used the same strategy as Ma Ji@@ aj@@ ia did .
their food su@@ cks , I tasted .
but I have a lot of respect for the founder , who is a boss exploring aliens and selling panc@@ akes .
he is very good at marketing himself on Wei@@ bo .
for example , he asks his wife to deliver a 12 @-@ yuan panc@@ ake in Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z .
so what does it mean ?
is it about the absolute advantage ?
absolutely not !
in today &apos;s Internet world , if we can find a comparative advantage when we start a business and rapidly seize the market , maybe we can get a greater advantage .
if so , we can be Tian Ji &apos;s horses .
so , don &apos;t wait for perfection , nor for everything to be ready .
there is no such thing .
and when you wait , you fail .
okay , what I just talked about was a higher level .
we all know how complicated it used to be to upgrade big systems and software , such as Microsoft , right ?
for example , how hard it was to upgrade to Windows 8 .
what &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s a perfect big software made by tens of thousands of engineers .
did it wait until it was ready ?
are you ready ?
ready !
get launched !
get paid !
that &apos;s the old software thinking , right ?
but in today &apos;s new era of mobile Internet , software engineers unveil a new development idea called iterative upgrade .
it means that as long as you have right ideas , interesting ideas , just make their debut reck@@ lessly .
we all know We@@ Chat and I &apos;m sure you remember it just had a very simple function that was &quot; Hold to Talk &quot; at its initial stage .
but now look at it , through repeated upgrades , it integrates ever richer functions including Lic@@ a@@ it@@ ong , Ten@@ pay and D@@ idi Tax@@ i .
it has become more and more well @-@ rounded and versatile , becoming the leader of its kind in China &apos;s mobile Internet market .
we can imagine how powerful a tool and a mobile Internet portal it will be in the future .
what made it possible ?
it &apos;s the iterative upgrade .
it &apos;s not just the language of software engineers , but also of us ordinary people .
you could look at your I@@ phone , everyone has one and you can feel how easy it is to upgrade your i@@ phone system .
if you think in the old way and take three or five years to make everything ready and perfect , the world has already changed when you launch something .
iterative upgrade not only requires us to overcome procrast@@ ination , but also urges us to take the initiative to use our comparative advantages which may not be perfect .
this is the active thinking in the era of mobile Internet .
from these examples I &apos;ve shared above , I want to say that we can use some of the inspir@@ ations from our work in our lives .
today , I &apos;m standing here , as the first speaker , capturing your most attention , no matter where are you from .
so I have a bonus for being a brick , right ?
just remember to be those who always dare to do things , even if you &apos;re not perfect .
I &apos;m J@@ F , which is inspired by I &apos;m MT .
so , it is the &quot; iterative upgrade &quot; that made me look like this and then made me what I am today .
there are some things in our life that you are not ready yet to do , and some things may not be perfect .
then should you just delay it ?
are you not going to be the first speaker on the stage to give a speech ?
no , because I am working on the mobile Internet now , I got an inspiration from it .
should our life be iter@@ atively upgraded too ?
because we dare to stand here today , because today , we are always ready !
thank you all !
yesterday , I asked my son , &quot; Who do you like most ? who would you like to become ? &quot;
he answered , &quot; I &apos;d like to be Prof. Do most . &quot;
I asked , &quot; Why ? &quot;
he said , &quot; Because he impres@@ ses and influences mum . &quot;
actually , deep inside , many of us wish to be someone else .
someone like the US president , who has the power to influence others .
right ?
who else ?
maybe Li Ka @-@ sh@@ ing , who &apos;s wealthy enough to influence others .
but you know what ?
I &apos;m not even close to Prof. Du .
look at me .
Qin often jokes I &apos;m like a wise bud@@ d@@ ha .
well , I &apos;m almost as bal@@ d@@ headed as a bud@@ d@@ ha . that &apos;s for sure .
for those of us without much money , power and wisdom , how can we impress and influence others ?
let me tell you a story of my pupil .
one day , when I was talking business with others via Q@@ Q , I suddenly received a message from a stranger , &quot; Are you Mr. Li L@@ ig@@ ang ? &quot;
and I replied , &quot; Yes , I am . &quot;
&quot; what &apos;s up ? &quot;
he said , &quot; I bought your book , on which there &apos;s your Q@@ Q account . I just want to check out if it &apos;s really yours . &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes , it &apos;s mine . &quot;
we continued to chat for about half an hour .
he then asked , &quot; Mr. Li , can you do me a favor ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Go ahead . &quot;
&quot; can you please give me some of your books that you no longer need ? &quot;
I asked , &quot; Why ? &quot;
he said , &quot; I am too poor to afford more books . would you like to help the poor ? &quot;
I realized that I was in no position to say NO .
so I replied , &quot; Well , OK . next time when I go to Chongqing , I &apos;ll take some books to you . &quot;
he was in Chongqing .
it turned out that when I went to Chongqing , I forgot to do so .
to keep my word , I bought him five books at the airport , which cost me RMB 127 in total . I remember it very clearly because I &apos;m a very st@@ ing@@ y person .
he asked , &quot; Mr. Li . where will you deliver your speech tomorrow ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Chongqing Jin@@ zi Hotel . &quot;
he asked , &quot; Can I come ? &quot;
I said , &quot; There &apos;s an admission fee of RMB 1,800 per person , according to the organizer . &quot;
he said , &quot; Mr. Li , you know I can &apos;t afford it . can I pretend to be your assistant ? I know you are always such a nice person . &quot;
the next day he did come , without paying a cent .
when I finished my one and half an hour &apos;s speech , he came to see me at the back@@ stage .
he said , &quot; Hello , Mr. Li . I &apos;m Xie . &quot;
I said , &quot; Nice to meet you ! &quot;
then he surprised me by suddenly genu@@ fl@@ ecting to me , asking &quot; Will Mr. Li please take me as your pupil ? &quot;
I asked , &quot; Why ? &quot;
he said , &quot; Because I like the ideas you talked about . &quot;
I said , &quot; Sorry , I cannot because I &apos;m unworthy of being your teacher . &quot;
he insisted , &quot; I will not stand up until you say Yes . &quot;
then I said , &quot; St@@ and up first and we talk . &quot;
he thus stood up and said , &quot; Mr. Li , you can call me Ba@@ jie and I &apos;ll address you as master . &quot;
since then , he stopped calling me Mr. Li .
what does he call me ?
do you know ?
he thought we were in a master @-@ pupil relationship from then on .
he said , &quot; Master , I &apos;m gonna graduate next year . have you got any client enterprise in Chongqing ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; can you send my resume to that auto company ? &quot;
you know what ?
I felt like he &apos;s the boss and I became his first employee .
he didn &apos;t find any job via my connections .
but in a similar way , he got a sales job at an auto company .
again he asked , &quot; Master . can you teach me how to become a champion ? &quot;
we thus talked about everything that mat@@ tered to becoming a champion .
four months later , he suddenly contacted me via We@@ Chat , &quot; Master . I &apos;m a champion now . &quot;
I said , &quot; Con@@ gr@@ ats . &quot;
he said , &quot; Your idea does work . &quot;
I replied , &quot; Thanks ! &quot;
I literally thanked him .
you know what ?
he later updated his Q@@ Q status with &quot; I &apos;ll do something big next year . &quot;
I asked , &quot; What is the big thing according to your definition ? &quot;
he refused to tell me and said , &quot; You will see next year . &quot;
one year later , I asked him via Q@@ Q , &quot; Can you unveil the answer now ? &quot;
he said , &quot; Yes , Master . I &apos;m running my own business now . I &apos;m the general manager and my elder sister &apos;s my vice general manager . I &apos;m just 21 , though . &quot;
this lad has deeply impressed me .
you know what ?
there &apos;s something more .
one day , I received a cylinder @-@ shaped gift from him . it &apos;s about this long .
the moment I opened the package , I knew why he could impress me .
his gift was something like a silk banner for heroic police .
I kept asking myself why Xie impressed me so much .
I could think of nothing more than the word &quot; giving . &quot;
the purpose of giving is to satisfy certain need of an individual .
when you need something , you ask for it .
just like in order to eat , you have to open your mouth first .
right ?
is there anyone who can have a meal without opening your mouth ? if so , please hands up .
I don &apos;t think there &apos;s any .
also , when you want to hear something , you have to use your ears .
likewise , when you want to impress or influence others , the best way is to give .
I used to think the Cantonese worldly and vulgar .
why ?
because whenever they meet someone , they invariably greet &quot; Hello , Mr. Hand@@ some or Miss . beautiful . &quot;
for me then , flattering at the first sight was too much .
but I gradually changed my view , considering the Cantonese &apos;s greeting not vulgar but smart .
why ?
because Guangdong was the pioneer of China &apos;s Reform and Opening @-@ up .
the Cantonese thus had the opportunity to meet various out@@ land@@ ers , who wanted to make friends and do business with them .
it &apos;s of course better for them to be nice to those strangers .
to make friends , it &apos;s better to give than to receive .
what can we give ?
which do you prefer to give ?
respect or benefit ?
you don &apos;t care as long as it costs you no money .
to sum up , we cannot expect anything from those who &apos;re unwilling to give their respect .
similarly , we cannot expect anything from those who &apos;re unwilling to give their big hand .
speaking of giving , what exactly should we give to others ?
perhaps the answer varies from person to person .
let &apos;s see the answer from man of top marketing wisdom .
as we see , man of top wisdom chooses to give benefit .
once when I was on my way to airport in Shanghai , I received a phone call and was attracted by a girl &apos;s voice .
she said , &quot; Hello , Mr. Li . this is the credit card service of XX@@ X bank . &quot;
I immediately said , &quot; No , thanks . &quot;
she continued , &quot; Sir , it &apos;s OK whether you need our card or not . the thing is , I &apos;d like to give you a little gift . will you take it ? &quot;
how could I hang it up ?
so I asked , &quot; What gift ? &quot;
she said , &quot; We &apos;ll give you one free tooth @-@ wash service per year . will you take it ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes , I &apos;d like to . &quot;
and I added , &quot; Any@@ thing else ? &quot;
she said , &quot; What about 12 rounds of golf for free ? &quot;
I said yes .
I asked again , &quot; Any@@ thing else ? &quot;
she said , &quot; We can give you one @-@ year free service . what service do you need ? &quot;
I asked , &quot; Can you give me one @-@ year free access to your airport VIP lounge ? &quot;
she said , &quot; S@@ ure . &quot;
then I said , &quot; De@@ al ! please come to see me at my office on August 29 . &quot;
you know what ?
she didn &apos;t show up on August 29 , which was to my surprise .
instead , she sent an intern to my office and asked , &quot; Are you Mr. Li ? &quot;
I said yes .
&quot; please show me your ID card and property ownership certificate , &quot; said she .
immediately after that , she began to process my application .
her presence made it impossible for me to say no .
so I applied for one credit card and thought it &apos;s up to me whether to use it or not .
it turned out that they promised to give fi@@ ve@@ fold points if I activated the card within designated days .
thus I did so and they fulfilled their promise .
you know what ?
I am a holder of China Eastern &apos;s gold card . but the other day , I was at the Beijing International Airport , waiting for a flight not provided by it .
I approached their staff and asked , &quot; Where is the VIP lounge of XX@@ X Bank at T@@ 3 ? &quot;
a lady answered me gently , &quot; Sir , please follow me . &quot;
I followed her down to the 2nd floor .
she led the way like a maid , while I was like Em@@ press Zhen@@ huan .
you know how I felt .
I suddenly understood why they gave me benefits for free .
they &apos;d say , &quot; It doesn &apos;t matter if you buy the beer or not . just have a drink . &quot;
they &apos;d say , &quot; It doesn &apos;t matter if you buy the grape or not . just have a taste . &quot;
they &apos;d say , &quot; It doesn &apos;t matter if you buy this car or not . just have a drive . &quot;
the other time , a lad even jo@@ ked , &quot; It doesn &apos;t matter if you marry me or not ... &quot;
so , the answer from man of top marketing wisdom is &quot; to give benefit . &quot;
what &apos;s the answer from man of second highest wisdom ?
it is &quot; to give respect . &quot;
to give respect means to make others feel good about themselves .
that &apos;s why the Cantonese call strangers Mr. Hand@@ some and Mr. Beautiful .
can you imagine a guy should go after a girl by telling her like this ?
&quot; hey , an ugly girl like you should feel flat@@ tered to have my affection and see a movie with me . &quot;
no one does that .
as you can see today , many people , regardless of occasions , are afraid of talking with the rich , the powerful or the elderly .
and they are particularly afraid of being nobody , neither having president &apos;s power nor Li Ka @-@ sh@@ ing &apos;s fortune .
how can a new graduate possibly impress and influence the senior management ?
please hands up if you have any idea .
you know what ?
all through the years , the question has tor@@ mented me .
fortunately , I find the answer now .
do you want to hear my answer ?
what should you give ?
you know what ?
I was once in a night@@ club , participating in a dealers &quot; meeting .
I was seated beside a board chairman , not knowing what to say .
he &apos;s a chairman , while I &apos;m a teacher .
he said , &quot; Hey , Mr. Li . please feel free to talk . &quot;
I said , &quot; OK . &quot;
&quot; just feel free to talk ！ &quot;
I said , &quot; OK . &quot;
for half an hour , we did nothing but repeat this nonsense .
although I felt so boring , I just couldn &apos;t find a topic to break the silence .
later , I gradually improved my chat skill at work .
my secret lies in giving others &quot; respect .
in other words , flattering them .
how ?
right now , we are preparing an interview at the back@@ stage .
whom are we going to interview ?
Tang Jun .
all pres@@ enters know how to flatter an inter@@ vie@@ wee with a right question .
today , I want to ask you a question .
should a hero be silent about his past gl@@ ories ?
do you feel free to deliver an acceptance speech ?
is the old saying that &quot; a hero should be silent about his past gl@@ ories &quot; a warning or a conclusion ?
it is a warning , for hardly any hero can resist the temptation of talking about his past gl@@ ories .
so , all pres@@ enters , including Li Yong , Li Jing , Dai Jun , Yang Lan and Chen Lu@@ yu would do so .
for example , when they interviewed comedian Tang Ji@@ e@@ zhong , they &apos;d ask , &quot; Mr.@@ Tang , can you summarize your pursuit of art all through the journey in one sentence ? &quot;
this seemingly plain question flat@@ tered the inter@@ vie@@ wee most .
that &apos;s the highest state of flattering .
we later jo@@ kingly concluded their little trick as &quot; all through the journey . &quot;
so when I couldn &apos;t find a proper topic to share with the board chairman beside me , I decided to try the pres@@ enters &quot; trick .
I said , &quot; Chairman Qu@@ an , you have accumulated RMB 200@@ m assets within three years . what an extraordinary achievement ! can you summarize your understanding all through the journey in one sentence ? &quot;
to my surprise , he was even more hypoc@@ ri@@ tical than I was .
he replied , &quot; ha@@ ha@@ ha , Mr. Li , you are an expert in this regard . you tell me . &quot;
even so , I gradually discovered that when I failed to impress him with one compliment , I just needed to keep trying others until he bought it .
after over one hour &apos;s chatting , I believed he was flat@@ tered .
another time a relative of mine talked with me .
he was then 59 and I was only 31 .
in the noon of the second day of the Chinese New Year , my relatives proposed to play ma@@ h @-@ j@@ ong .
as a Sic@@ hu@@ an@@ er , I love playing ma@@ h @-@ j@@ ong .
but I hate to be en@@ circled by a gang of women , including my wife .
I thus said to that senior relative , &quot; Shall we have a chat instead ? &quot;
he said , &quot; Good idea . what can we talk about ? &quot;
see ? you can imagine how I felt .
I said , &quot; As a veteran in your industry , can you share with me your experience and understanding all through the journey ? &quot;
you know what ?
he fell for flat@@ tery easily .
he said , &quot; O@@ k . you may be an expert in your consulting industry , but not in mine . I &apos;d like to share with you my working experience . &quot;
I recalled my previous boss often asked me to take notes when listening to a &quot; big fish . &quot;
so I asked , &quot; Uncle , have you got any paper ? &quot;
his son brought me a pen and paper .
then I took notes while he was talking .
one hour later , he said , &quot; Li , the living room is so cold . let &apos;s go into the air @-@ conditioned bedroom and continue . &quot;
there , we had another one @-@ hour &apos;s talk .
I asked , &quot; Uncle , can I get more paper ? &quot;
he was a good speaker .
seriously . I took all his brilliant ideas down .
his words did benefit me a lot .
I did not pretend to be modest .
you know what ?
four hours later , his wife couldn &apos;t stand it anymore .
she told us the dinner was ready for a couple of times . after all , it &apos;s the second day of Chinese New Year .
but neither of us replied her .
she grew angry , &quot; If you don &apos;t want it , I will dump it . &quot;
hearing that , my uncle said , &quot; Li , let &apos;s have dinner first , or else she won &apos;t give us a break . &quot;
after dinner , he said , &quot; Li , I still have something to share . &quot;
that &apos;s what we call &quot; feel like old friends at the first meeting . &quot;
essentially , &quot; a house on fire &quot; occurs when you meet a &quot; big fish &quot; and you two immediately establish a rap@@ port .
you know .
you &apos;re not supposed to stop the other high @-@ spirited one talking , however you want to deep inside .
this is how man of second highest wisdom do , this is , giving respect .
how can you expect anything from those who &apos;re unwilling to give their respect ?
when you can &apos;t afford to give your employees bonus , give them more certificates of merit at least .
that &apos;s probably how your boss did .
anyway , profit comes first , respect second .
what &apos;s third ?
man of the third highest wisdom may give &quot; approach . &quot;
in a Buddhist context , profit @-@ giving corresponds to &quot; property @-@ giving &quot; ; respect @-@ giving corresponds to &quot; confidence @-@ boosting &quot; ; &quot; approach @-@ giving &quot; corresponds to &quot; method @-@ teaching , &quot; i.e. showing others the way to target fulfillment .
I asked my kid , &quot; What do you want to do at school ? &quot;
he said , &quot; I &apos;d like to be a leader of young pioneers . &quot;
his answer inspired me on how to treat my son .
later , whenever he felt aggrieved and began to cry , I would stop him by reminding that &quot; a leader of young pioneers is not supposed to be like that . &quot;
he wiped his tears off and stopped crying .
you know what ?
where there &apos;s a will , there &apos;s energy .
when you believe you are shoul@@ dering a certain mission , you &apos;d feel energetic .
do you agree ?
this is one objective of the Buddhist &quot; method @-@ teaching , &quot; namely , dreaming .
we need to find a proper approach to realize our dream .
years ago , the movie line &quot; What do you think , Yuan@@ fang ? &quot; went viral across China .
I can &apos;t figure out how it became so popular .
its instant fame seemed unexpected and ridiculous .
let &apos;s assume in the movie , Li Yuan@@ fang &apos;s superior Di Ren@@ jie asked him in another way .
di Ren@@ jie could say , &quot; Yuan@@ fang , I think we should first ... , then ... and then ... &quot; Do you think Yuan@@ fang would have any chance to reach his full potential ?
it never occurred to Li Yuan@@ fang .
in that case , who should get the credit if their mission was accomplished ? Li Yuan@@ fang or Di Ren@@ jie ?
the answer should be Di Ren@@ jie , for he contributed the idea and approach .
do you agree ?
how can you expect anything from a boss who &apos;s unwilling to give their staff basic respect ?
that &apos;s why Di Ren@@ jie asked in reply , &quot; What do you think , Yuan@@ fang &quot; whenever Li Yuan@@ fang came to ask for his advice .
how could such a brilliant guy as Di have no idea at all ?
the modern version of Yuan@@ fang would say , &quot; I failed to persuade that salesman . should I try once more ? &quot;
di would say , &quot; S@@ ure ! anything else ? &quot;
Yuan@@ fang would answer , &quot; I &apos;d better to take someone with me this time . can I ? &quot;
&quot; sure ! what else ? &quot;
you see ?
that &apos;s how a person grows mature step by step under guidance .
do you agree ?
therefore I think influence is essentially about giving .
giving benefit , respect and approach ( or rather , method of realizing one &apos;s dream ) .
in addition to top , second and third highest wisdom , there &apos;s also inv@@ incible wisdom .
this inv@@ incible wisdom belongs to three holy figures .
Premier Zhou En@@ lai used to appeal to the young for &quot; studying hard for the rise of China . &quot;
this showed his concern for the whole country .
how about Chairman Mao ?
he called for the liberation of all mankind , which was even more ambitious .
how about religion ?
religions advocate salvation .
what does that mean ?
what &apos;s next when they have given all respect , benefits and approaches ?
to put it another way , what if they have nothing more to give ?
they can give you &quot; future . &quot;
please hands up if you &apos;ve ever been to the Western Paradise .
no one .
please hands up if you &apos;ve ever been to the heaven .
no one , either .
but you know what ?
happiness comes to you when you are on your way to your dream .
when they cannot give you anything more , they promise you a bright future .
in this regard , no one can be more excellent than the three holy figures , namely , Jesus Christ , Pro@@ ph@@ et Mu@@ ham@@ mad and Buddha Sha@@ k@@ y@@ am@@ un@@ i .
the three religious figures not only give you &quot; present , &quot; but also &quot; future . &quot;
so they are simply inv@@ incible .
the word &quot; give &quot; can be interpreted differently in different contexts .
according to Christianity , to give is to love .
other religions may associate &quot; giving &quot; with &quot; positive energy &quot; and &quot; divine intervention or salvation . &quot;
in Chairman Mao &apos;s words , to give means to serve the people .
thanks to such great figures , the whole world becomes more and more faithful , more peaceful and happier .
in Chinese history , the Tao@@ ists once attempted to challenge the above three religious figures .
they found nothing to give now that the &quot; next life &quot; was already promised by others .
what could they do ?
they chose to eter@@ n@@ alize &quot; this life . &quot;
so they began to make &quot; pills of immortality &quot; with al@@ chem@@ istic materials .
later , with their &quot; pills &quot; proving to be ineffective , their impact was weakened .
the topic today is how we can impress and influence others .
we conclude that we can influence others by &quot; giving . &quot;
what should we give ?
benefit , respect and approach .
what has been advocated most in recent years ?
not IQ , but E@@ Q .
what &apos;s the core of E@@ Q ?
it is an ability to control your desire and emotion and to relate to other people .
so this &quot; control &quot; is about two aspects , receiving and giving .
that &apos;s why we consider high E@@ Q a must for leadership .
how can you impress and influence others , approach others , unite others and convince others ? have you ever thought about it ?
with what you can convince them ?
it &apos;s all about giving .
so grass @-@ roots employees should get paid before the management .
yet , the earlier a payment is made , the smaller it is .
fair enough , isn &apos;t it ?
so my dear friend , do you wanna possess larger influence ?
when you need anything but money , please give some money to those who are in dire need .
if you have nothing to give , not even the money , you can still give them your smile , a nod of greeting and compliment .
if you can &apos;t even give your smile , a nod of greeting and compliment , you can still contribute your thinking and body .
thanks !
today I &apos;d like to talk about the meaning of life .
I believe that many of you have been following up on the news of Malaysia Airlines .
every time we hear of such tragedies , we contemplate why we exist since life is short and we cannot foresee what will happen next .
what &apos;s the meaning of life ?
in my opinion , the Malaysia Airlines event not only affects those on board , but also relatives of them .
if we lose our close relatives , who play important roles in our whole life , what should we do ?
then we will think about another question : why do I continue to live even though those who mean everything to me are forever gone ?
in other words , is there any other source that gives a sense of meaning to life ?
those who suffer from disaster are never the only ones to question the meaning of life .
have you ever watched the news ?
do you know what was the top killer for people from 15 to 34 according to the research carried out in 2008 ?
guess what ?
it &apos;s suicide .
since 2000 , every two minutes there is someone committing suicide in China .
that is to say , maybe during the eighteen minutes of my speech , nine people will be gone forever .
from the pieces of information left by those who kill themselves , we can always find the following questions .
why do I live ?
who am I ?
where should I go ?
how can I face the coming days ?
in the end , they choose suicide to answer all of these questions .
apart from them , I guess we all think about similar questions .
those who cannot find meaning in their studies don &apos;t know why they go to school .
those who don &apos;t have sense of meaning at work will probably resign .
those who cannot figure out reasons to maintain their relationships or marriages will probably break up .
everyone aband@@ ons what they are doing if it holds no meaning to them anymore .
what a special species mankind is !
as dear Huang said before , &quot; Everyone has his own concerns . &quot;
when we lose a sense of meaning , we know what we must do , but we do not know why , so we are haunted by a kind of nostalgia .
due to the nature of my work , I talk with many people and often ask them , &quot; Well , what do you think is the meaning of life ? &quot;
&quot; before you asked this question , I felt content with my life , &quot; they reply , &quot; but now I am lost , as originally I didn &apos;t have to think about what the meaning of my work was , or what the meaning of life was . after your question , I feel suddenly everything is less meaningful that it was . &quot;
if any of you have thoughts similar to my friends , feel despair from a lack of meaning , or even don &apos;t know how to face your lives while struggling for a sense of meaning , then I have to tell you that all the pains you suffer are meaningful because they keep you chasing after meaning .
only then will you realize that meaning is hard to chase .
to some degree , nostalgia and pain is also a kind of privilege .
and this reminds me of something else .
we have so many beautiful girls here .
do you like to stick Band @-@ A@@ ids to your heels when wearing high @-@ he@@ eled shoes , especially when they are new ?
if so , why ?
it is because it hurts to wear them , but you still want to wear them , right ?
why do you wear them if it hurts ?
we wear them because beauty is meaningful to us .
just like what I said about music , we can feel the beauty of music each time we listen to it , and beauty is a meaningful concept .
it &apos;s the same with men .
although I don &apos;t know how you act when you &apos;re in love , I notice that nearly every man is willing to wait for his lover for one or two hours , even despite wind , rain or snow , without complaints , and feel quite moved from the experience .
they think what they do is meaningful because of love .
what &apos;s the situation after marriage ?
maybe you are not married now , but when you do , you may find that your men downstairs will sound the horn impati@@ ently though they have only waited for five minutes in their cars .
put another way , why can &apos;t they wait longer ?
it is because it &apos;s meaningless to add bait when you &apos;ve already hooked the fish , right ?
in fact , I believe that a sense of meaning is a significant driving force for everything that we do .
I &apos;d like to share an idea with you .
the idea is that people who know what they live for can bear almost any suffering in life .
in other words , when we know why we are doing something , whether it be for love , a dream or family , we have every reason to overcome the difficulties that we encounter .
so when it comes to psychological health , I want to emphasize that despite the concept of meaning being lofty and abstract , it &apos;s an essential nutrient for our souls .
if we don &apos;t know the reasons , then we can neither bear the pains , nor continue to do the things at hand .
someone even put forward a formula : &quot; despair equals pain minus meaning . &quot;
therefore , if we find more meaning from the pains we suffer , we won &apos;t despair ; that is , meaning makes pain toler@@ able .
speaking of this , an interesting investigation occurred to me , and now I &apos;d like to share it with you .
I have two options for you .
dear friends , for all of you , the first option is to have the opportunity now to say hello to anyone within the audience .
the second option is to get RMB 100,000 , after @-@ tax .
people often ask &quot; Is the money I get before @-@ tax or after @-@ tax ? &quot;
of course it &apos;s after @-@ tax .
so the two options are a word with another audience member , or RMB 100,000 .
how many people would choose the first option ?
please put up your hands .
that &apos;s why you attended my speech today ?
since you are sensible , you know that 100,000 yuan is rare , while you have many opportunities to have a word with someone else .
then how about this ?
the first option is still to have a word with someone else , but this time , it &apos;s to have a word@@ with the most valuable person in your life for the last time , and then you will never see them again .
the second option is to get RMB 1 million , also after @-@ tax .
so the last word with the most valuable person , or RMB 1 million - which one do you choose ?
do we still have any audience members who choose the latter ?
we have one .
may I know why you chose the money ?
you can talk by telephone if you cannot meet ; well , that makes sense .
the most unbelievable answer I &apos;ve ever heard was &quot; the reason why I chose to have a word with the most valuable person in my life is that I know I can inherit more than RMB 1 million from him .
that &apos;s indeed a terrible answer .
anyway , the fact that you would rather have a word than accept RMB 1 million demonstrates that meaningful things , even conversations , are more important than things that are meaningless .
even if we live in a materi@@ alistic world , we still depend on our spiritual world .
we cannot truly know the worth of anything in the world if it &apos;s not measured by meaning .
so when we try to find meaning in our lives , we are actually creating the worth that we care about the most .
meaning brings value , and value makes pain end@@ urable .
why do I have to bear painful work today ?
we all have different reasons : for love , children , or dreams .
meaning can either be a relief to our suffering , or a reason to withstand it .
in particular , meaning can also be a significant goal , for ourselves , our love , our careers , our dreams , and so on .
how does a meaningful goal influence our lives ?
now we are all in a hurry , and I once noticed a report from a news weekly that China is a hasty country where everyone is in a hurry to become famous , successful or rich as soon as possible .
you might realize that most of them don &apos;t enjoy the present moment or the process .
why is that ?
they think it &apos;s not the process but the result that matters , so they endure the meaningless process to wait for milestones , to wait for their victory .
what &apos;s the cost of this ?
here is a story .
an experienced traveler once travelled to India where he saw thousands of Indians climbing a mountain for a pilgri@@ mage .
women with children and the elderly with can@@ es were also among the people climbing the steep mountain .
then he thought , &quot; I always exercise , so I &apos;m fit enough to have a try . I believe I can climb faster than them . &quot;
twenty minutes later , however , he couldn &apos;t catch his breath ; and unlike him , the others were talking and having fun while climbing .
he talked with the Indians who could speak English around him and asked , &quot; Why can you climb the mountain so leisurely while I &apos;m out of breath ? &quot;
an Indian said , &quot; You &apos;re a typical American , always taking everything as a task ; when you climb , you want to climb to the top quickly , while for us , this mountain is a sacred place , and we are lifted by each step . we enjoy climbing it and want to be a part of it . it means a lot to us , so we don &apos;t feel tired . &quot;
I guess this may be inspir@@ ational for those who are always in a hurry .
only when we know the meaning of the process will we be neither anxious nor uneasy .
I am always wondering what true achievements are in life .
your achievement equals your everyday growth multiplied by the length of your life .
in other words , the achievements you have got throughout your life divided by the length of your life equals your everyday growth .
if you feel that your everyday growth is meaningful , then congratulations , you are close to success .
so I draw the conclusion that with a meaningful target , all of us can enjoy the journey , and it &apos;s not only after arriving at the destination that we feel happy and satisfied .
after everything I &apos;ve said , some may say , &quot; I still don &apos;t know what the meaning of life is . &quot;
well , when we try to figure that out , as is often the case , we cannot find an answer .
why ?
heaven will not answer this question .
why does Heaven refuse to answer it ?
it is because nobody can , except ourselves .
does the world have any absolute meaning ?
does life hold any constant meaning ?
at the very least , I don &apos;t think so .
everyone &apos;s life has a different meaning .
so how about this ? let &apos;s not keep inquiring about the meaning of life .
instead , ask yourself , how can you live a meaningful life for you@@ self ?
well , how can we live a meaningful life ?
I offer you four measures for your reference .
the first one is via creation .
is it possible to make a difference ? can we make the world a better place with our efforts ?
imagine this , one day when we are going to leave the world , the UN sends a child to pay us a vis@@ it.@@ Then he comes to our sick@@ bed and asks , &quot; Hello , there . have you done anything in your life that you are very proud of ? have you created anything that makes you feel that life is worthwhile , and that you didn &apos;t waste it ? &quot;
I don &apos;t know what your answers are .
you will probably call your children a creation , or you are proud of the smile you gave to the person sitting next to you , because your smile may have put him or her in a good mood all day .
our creations can be anything , significant or insignificant .
the second is via experience .
after many days of haze , it &apos;s finally a fine day today in Beijing .
I believe even if we do nothing except bas@@ king in and breathing in the fresh air , these are irreplaceable experiences in life .
if one day aliens come to the Earth with their flying sauc@@ ers and kidn@@ ap you , then they might ask you , &quot; After so many years of living on the Earth , what is your most impressive experience there ? &quot;
I cannot imagine what your answer might be .
but I hope it &apos;s not &quot; despair . &quot;
actually , listening to music or speeches can be a kind of experience , and meaningful ones at that .
to some extent , life develops through experiences .
the next one is via relationships .
do we live for the ones we love , or for ourselves ?
in China , relationships are a source of meaning and , also , pressure .
we always hear people say they cannot afford to die , right ?
this is because they all have parents , children , and so many social responsibilities .
it has been found in western countries that if someone only lives for himself , it &apos;s very dangerous for him .
when he feels despair , his world collapses .
he has every reason to commit suicide , because he finds no more meaning from life .
on the contrary , if he lives for the people that he loves , he can definitely find more meaning to life , and more reasons to face pain or despair in the future .
finally , the last one is via attitude .
what can we do in situations like where we cannot break up a miserable marriage , cannot quit an un@@ satisfying job , or even have a naughty child who does not get along well with you ?
well , we can choose the proper attitude towards suffering .
maybe this sounds abstract .
I will give an example to prove it .
a psychologist once paid a visit to his friend in a hospital who was in a coma due to a serious illness .
during his visit , he saw a nurse hanging a drawing on the wall opposite of his friend &apos;s sick@@ bed , and he also found that this nurse was cheerful , with a different facial expression from the others .
he then asked , &quot; Why are you so happy ? &quot;
&quot; me ? I &apos;m here to take care of patients , &quot; she explained . &quot; I think my job is important . though your friend never awak@@ ens , it &apos;s my hope that he &apos;ll see something beautiful as soon as he does . &quot;
through this story , I realize that in fact we can choose meaningful ways to do humble jobs - even ones that may not be promising in our opinions .
this nurse thought that she was not just an ordinary worker , and she was responsible for the health of many patients .
therefore , she could feel a sense of meaning by creating an agreeable environment for her patients , as well as creating opportunities to help them .
she was also experiencing something special .
maybe someday she will write a book , narr@@ ating the feelings she had and the turns of lives she saw in the hospital .
I guess the lives she saw were far more meaningful than what I spoke of and experienced .
apart from creation and relationships , she could find a sense of meaning in her attitude .
we are always free , even in misery or while undertaking intolerable work .
that is , we are free to choose our attitude towards our suffering .
so this nurse truly had nothing to be ashamed of .
usually , we Chinese like to say , &quot; I have nothing to be ashamed of , &quot; especially when we have failed to achieve something .
though we end up failing , we don &apos;t give up .
this is the meaning of failure .
as exist@@ enti@@ alist psychologists have said , we always have freedom one way or another .
so what is that freedom ?
for a nurse , some may think that she or he is forced to take that job to earn money and support her or his family .
many people &apos;s goals are set by others , like when your supervisor tells you what to do and how to do it .
if they are sensible enough , they will try to find a sense of meaning in life .
they will probably grasp spontaneous meaning from the goals forced upon them .
finally , they come to a turning point , from having been forced by society to pursue a sense of meaning to living for themselves .
all in all , everyone possesses the inseparable freedom to turn around their lives by pursuing meaning .
now I must talk about Victor Frank@@ l , a renowned exist@@ enti@@ alist psychologist .
what I said before about how to find meaning is based on his studies .
he said when you do nothing , you can shift from a state of doing into one of being .
when you are under great pressure , you couldn &apos;t do anything .
that posture is still meaningful .
back in 19@@ 42 , shortly after his wedding , he and his wife were sent to a concentration camp .
worse yet , his parents , brother , and almost all of his relatives were sent there .
two years later , some were dead , and some were murdered in gas chambers .
after he lost his wife , his book - the product of his painstaking efforts - was also burnt to ashes .
even his own life was threatened .
how did he survive such an intolerable situation ?
how can a man live when he loses every target in life and every source of meaning ?
one day , Frank@@ l had a vision that he survived the concentration camp , stood in a bright church , and delivered a speech on concentration camp psychology .
he thought that maybe all of his suffering was a experiment on human beings .
if the experiment was completed , he could help more people in misery with his own experimental results .
so I reckon that all of the pains you have suffered in life were suffered for the sake of others , and when you experience this you can help more people to get rid of their suffering .
never abandon freedom , the one thing that makes an un@@ changeable environment meaningful .
at last , I &apos;d like share with you the meaning of misfortune , if you are suffering from it .
here is some , but not all of them .
first , Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche once said , &quot; Whatever doesn &apos;t kill you simply makes you stronger . &quot;
your soul will grow strong while you feel despair in the bottom of your heart .
suffering is just an ordeal for the soul .
second , the most rewarding experiences usually originate from the worst situations .
when you are at a low ebb , you &apos;re just building up your strength and seeking wisdom .
in addition , pain brings changes .
often despite feeling pain we still do not change .
in this case , our pain has no meaning .
pain is an om@@ en for change , whether caused by marriage or our personal lives .
so pain is a way in which life communic@@ ates with us .
besides the changes brought by pain , we will also develop empathy for others who suffer from pain .
have you ever thought that the reason why we feel lonely is that we long for companions ?
if you don &apos;t feel lonely anymore , then what can bring individuals in the society all together ?
as a matter of fact , all the suffering we &apos;ve experienced tigh@@ tens the bonds between us , and it improves our understanding of each other &apos;s situations .
when faced with catastrophe , people will become closer to one another , sticking together .
when in distress , we like to contemplate - why are we here ?
why must I endure all of this ?
and what &apos;s the meaning of life ?
suffering drives us to look for faith .
regardless of your faith , from now on we may as well pursue the meaning of life and hold the belief that meaning not only makes pain end@@ urable but also prop@@ els us to progress towards our goals .
in addition , only after we find meaning from suffering do we have greater hope in life .
mark Twain once said , &quot; The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why . &quot;
maybe it will take a long time for us to find out why , but , the process of finding out is quite meaningful in our lives .
I hope that we all ask ourselves the question , &quot; How can we live a meaningful life ? , &quot; and take action accordingly .
a sense of meaning is an inalienable freedom possessed by everyone , and it is the origin of our dignity as well as the destinations in our lives .
thank you all !
2,@@ 300 years ago , there was a philosopher in Greece named Aristotle .
according to Aristotle , almost all then known continents were in the northern hemisphere .
he wondered whether the earth would be unstable if this was the case .
therefore , he made an assumption that there could be a land@@ mass in the south pole of the earth and he called the land@@ mass &quot; Antarctica . &quot;
with this bold assumption , he deduced that there could be an ocean in the north pole of the earth to keep the balance , so he called it &quot; Arctic . &quot;
almost all the major geographical discoveries in the southern hemisphere made over the subsequent 2,@@ 300 years were in close ties with this assumption of Aristotle .
about four years ago in 2011 , a year marked human &apos;s 100@@ th successful tre@@ ks to the South Pole , I really wanted to go to Antarctica that seemed to have a special appe@@ l to me .
as many thought this place was only accessible to scientific research teams , I decided to figure out in 2011 whether it could be visited by ordinary people .
I looked it up on the Internet and found an American website that claimed to sell steam@@ ship tickets to the South Pole .
I also found other websites that sold soils on the moon , but in comparison , this site looked more reliable .
so I paid with my credit card for a steam@@ ship ticket to the South Pole .
after buying the ticket , I received an email that invited me to the South Pole .
I was required to board at 3 o &apos; clock in the afternoon of January 10 , 2012 in U@@ shu@@ ai@@ a , Argentina .
it turned out that the ship was not coming to Shanghai to pick me up .
the next problem was getting an plain@@ e ticket to the place called Argentina .
where is Argentina ?
it &apos;s in South America .
the United States is always said to be the anti@@ po@@ de of China , but it is still in the northern hemisphere , right ?
where is the real anti@@ po@@ de of China ?
actually , our real anti@@ po@@ de is situated diame@@ tr@@ ically opposite to China and it is in South America .
so U@@ shu@@ ai@@ a could be the farthest destination on the earth that we can fly to from Shanghai .
how long was the flight ?
it would take two whole days .
we set off at Shanghai to arrive in Dubai , then from Dubai to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil , from there we go to Buenos Aires in Argentina and fly sou@@ th@@ wards to a place called Arafat , finally we will land in U@@ shu@@ ai@@ a .
U@@ shu@@ ai@@ a is the sou@@ ther@@ n@@ most city in the world .
after buying the ship ticket and plane tickets , the next important thing was to apply for the visa .
as the South Pole is not a country , tourists heading there have to land in Argentina first .
so it is indispensable to have the visa to Argentina .
I then called a travel agency .
I didn &apos;t contact any travel agency in advance because I planned to go the Antarctica alone .
so I called a travel agency and said , &quot; I want to go to Argentina . can you help me get a visa ? &quot;
the travel agency replied : &quot; sorry , Argentina does not issue travel visas to individuals . &quot;
I said , &quot; Then how did other people get there ? so many have gone there , there &apos;s always a way . how did they get it ? &quot;
the agency answered , &quot; They are group tourists , Argentina does not issue travel visas to individuals . &quot;
but I &apos;ve already bought the steam@@ ship ticket and the plane ticket .
I can &apos;t drop this now .
I must go .
I have to go to Argentina and the South Pole .
he asked , &quot; Are you sure ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes , I really want to go . &quot;
he said , &quot; Fine , I will schedule a one @-@ man tour group for you . &quot;
yes , there was such a way .
then I went to the embassy and the visa officer asked me , &quot; What about the other people in the group ? &quot;
I answered that everyone else canceled this trip and it was just me now . the travel agency decided to send me to Argentina as planned to keep their credibility .
finally , I got a visa and an air ticket to Argentina and a steam@@ ship ticket to the South Pole .
I was all set to depart from Shanghai .
then I thought that going to the South Pole was my dream and it might also be the dream of many people .
so , was there any way I could help some of them realize this dream ?
I launched an activity on Wei@@ bo , I said if anyone were willing to donate 20 hours to charity works in the year of 2012 and no matter what you did , as long as it was charitable and you comm@@ ited to your donation , which I believe you would .
so if you spend 20 hours on charity in 2012 , I would send a postcard for you to the people you love most from the end of the world , the South Pole .
the activity generated a lot of responses , a lot of people wanted to get the postcard and have it send to their loved one from the sou@@ ther@@ n@@ most tip of the earth .
I limited the number of post@@ cards at 100 considering my baggage volume .
why 100 ?
if one person donated 20 hours , how many hours would 100 people give out ?
I did the math and it would be 2,000 hours .
if a person is expected to work for about 8 hours a day and there are 250 work days in a year .
then 250 times 8 is exactly 2,000 hours .
in other words , if I really helped 100 people take their little dreams to the South Pole and post back to China , that means I hired someone to do charity works for the whole year of 2012 .
after receiving 100 post@@ cards , I found that there were still many people who saw this activity on my Wei@@ bo .
at that time , a lot of my friends called me and said , &quot; I heard that you &apos;re going to the South Pole ? &quot;
I replied : &quot; yes , so you know . &quot;
&quot; em , can you bring me a pengu@@ in ? &quot;
&quot; pengu@@ ins are out of question . &quot;
they said , &quot; Well , can you send a postcard ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay , I will note down all your addresses . &quot;
with 100 postcard dreams and 400 requests from my friends , I finally went to the South Pole with 500 wishes .
however , it seemed unlikely to buy 500 post@@ cards in Argentina and then write the addresses .
it may take two days and two nights or more to write all addresses , let alone writing greetings .
so I designed a postcard by myself and turned to a printing house in Shanghai .
before that , I had consulted relevant Argentine authorities by phone , &quot; Is there any rule in Argentina that only post@@ cards produced by local post offices can be sent out ? &quot;
they replied that post@@ cards of all formats could be sent out from Argentina .
so I printed 500 post@@ cards in China and asked the printing house to print the addresses on them .
this helped me save the time to write addresses .
but the greeting words cannot be printed , as it would a print instead of a postcard .
so I left the space for greeting words blank .
eventually , I boarded the plane with 500 post@@ cards .
how long it would take to get from Shanghai to Argentina ?
tow days and two nights , right ?
so what will I do on the plane in such a long time ?
writing greeting words .
I had to be very careful , for perhaps some of the people who receive my post@@ cards know each other and it would be embarrassing if they found the greetings on their post@@ cards were the same .
so the greeting words should be different .
I rac@@ ked my brain for two days and one night and finally finished all the post@@ cards when the plane landed .
my biggest gain from this was that my handwriting was greatly improved .
as soon as the plane landed in Argentina , I visited the post office at the sou@@ ther@@ n@@ most tip of the world , the end of the world we talked about .
opening the office door , I took out 500 post@@ cards and put them on the desk , the officer handed me the postmark stamp and asked me to stamp them by myself .
well China is populated and I guessed that he had never seen someone 500 post@@ cards so he gave me the postmark stamp .
I stamped each postcard , but you know , it takes time for post@@ marks to dry .
so I can &apos;t stack these post@@ cards together so that they will dry themselves .
so I had to put them on the floor , one postcard , two post@@ cards , three post@@ cards and finally the floor of the post office was covered by 500 post@@ cards heading to China .
I put all of them in the mailbox and sent them back to China with 500 dreams they carried .
at 3 o &apos;clock in the afternoon , I arrived at the dock .
there was really a steam@@ ship waiting for us , so I boarded the Noah &apos;s Ar@@ k .
after we were on board , all our passports were taken away because we were going to a place without any country .
then the team leader told us that there were 99 tourists on the steam@@ ship , from 14 countries including the United States , Brazil , the UK and Finland , I was the only Chinese .
I thought what an interesting trip it would be .
everyone here , regardless of where he came from , Finland , Canada or Brazil , must had interesting experiences .
he must have gone to a lot of places before he decided to go to the South Pole .
few people would go to the South Pole when they have not yet been to Nanjing first ; few people would go explore the ocean beyond when they have not yet been to Shanghai ; fewer people would go to a continent where there is no country when they have not yet stepped out of their country in their lifetime .
so I started chatting with them .
there was an American guy who was very interesting , he lived in San Francisco ,
he told me one day he found that his job was terribly boring , so he decided to go on a trip .
but he had no idea about where to go .
he pointed casually on the map and planned to go wherever he pointed at .
un@@ intentionally , he pointed at the South Pole .
so he bought a ticket from San Francisco to Argentina .
it is relatively easier to fly from North America to South America and to get a visa .
he paid just 100 USD for a 10 @-@ year visa to Argentina .
after he arrived in U@@ shu@@ ai@@ a , he pushed open the door of a local cafe and decided to earn some money there .
not all amer@@ ic@@ ans are rich and he had no extra money for the steam@@ ship ticket after paying for the plane ticket .
while working in the cafe , he was waiting for &quot; a last minute ticket . &quot;
what is the last minute ticket ?
there are always people around the world who have bought tickets but cannot get to U@@ shu@@ ai@@ a for various reasons .
local bo@@ at@@ men will put the last minute tickets on their windows .
many glo@@ bet@@ rot@@ ting back@@ pack@@ ers who couldn &apos;t afford the expensive ticket would arrive in U@@ shu@@ ai@@ a earlier to grab the last minute tickets .
if the ticket was originally priced at 9,000 dollars , the last minute ticket may cost only 2,000 or 3,000 dollars .
so there will be many people waiting for such tickets every day .
fortunately , this American guy got one .
not long after he boarded the steam@@ ship , he met an Australian girl .
suddenly I thought it was like a movie scene .
we were going to a place full of ice@@ ber@@ gs , so we hurried to check if there were enough life@@ boats on the steam@@ ship .
how long would it take to get to the Antarctic continent from U@@ shu@@ ai@@ a ?
another two days and two nights .
starting from U@@ shu@@ ai@@ a , Argentina , the sou@@ ther@@ n@@ most city in the world , the steam@@ ship sailed for two whole days and crossed the Dr@@ ake Passage .
the Dr@@ ake Passage is the most treacherous water@@ ways on the planet .
it spans the distance between the South America and Antarctica , connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans .
it is also the place where cold currents and warm currents meet , making it difficult for many ships to pass through .
there were circumstances when the ships could not get through the Dr@@ ake Passage so they had to sail back .
after a two @-@ day voyage , we finally reached the Antarctica .
so how long does it take in total to get to the Antarctica from Shanghai .
at least four days and four nights before you reach the Antarctica .
after I set foot on Antarctic , I shot a beautiful video that I just played .
I can say that Antarctica is the most beautiful place I have ever seen .
after returning to Shanghai , I decided to write down some of my feelings .
one editor , after reading several of my articles , encouraged me to write a book about the experience .
I said it was a good idea .
so he recommended a publishing house .
after taking with the publishing house , my book 2012 , Buy A T@@ icket to the South Pole was published .
the book had first printed 25,000 copies .
it sells well .
after collecting my royalty fee , I suddenly realized that my trip to the South Pole didn &apos;t cost me a dime .
if the book had sold better , I would have the money to go to the North Pole .
this inspired at once my desire to go to the North Pole .
how can I get to the North Pole ?
the North Pole is completely different from the South Pole .
the South Pole is on a continent and our goal was to embark the land@@ mass while the North Pole is located in the vast ocean .
although some countries have land masses within the Arctic Circle , such as Canada , Greenland , Finland , etc . , the middle of the North Pole is a stretch of sea .
so where exactly is the North Pole ?
I don &apos;t think that setting foot on these land masses means a visit to the North Pole .
and the place I really want to go is right in the middle of the Arctic Ocean , I want to go to the real North Pole .
but how can I get there ?
the vicinity of the North Pole is covered by thick ice fields throughout the year .
how can I get to the North Pole ?
I looked it up on the Internet again .
this time , I found a Chinese website named Tri@@ pol@@ ers , a company founded by Mr. Qu Xiang@@ dong , one of my old friends .
then I contacted Mr. Qu and said , &quot; Hey , I just learned that you can organize trips to the North Pole . can I go with you ? can you give me a discount ? &quot;
he replied , &quot; I have read your book , 2012 , Buy A T@@ icket to the South Pole . if you write another book about the trip to the North Pole , I will give you a free steam@@ ship ticket . &quot;
I was so excited when I heard that and I said , &quot; Great , I &apos;m in . &quot;
I found another publishing house and said that now I had a ticket to the North Pole and I planned to write a best seller next .
what makes a book a best seller ?
Han Han once said a book having over 30,000 copies was a best seller .
I asked if the publisher could print 30,000 copies of my book at the first print .
because if so , my book could be a best seller from its debut .
he said that he needed to read the book I wrote before at first .
after reading it , he thought it was feasible and informed me to sign the contract .
then I told Mr. Qu that I signed the contract and I could go with him to the North Pole .
before setting off to the North Pole , I was thinking that when I went to the South Pole , I sent post@@ cards to 500 people , right ?
100 of them got a postcard by doing charity works .
shall I do the same for my trip to the North Pole ?
should I help those 100 people complete their postcard collection of both the North Pole and the South Pole ?
I thought it was of great meaning for them .
so , I launched a new activity on Wei@@ bo .
I said that I would send a postcard from the Nor@@ h Pole for people who would donate 24 hours in 20@@ 13 to charity works .
based on my previous experience , I decided to send out 1000 post@@ cards this time to those who are willing to work for the charity .
this activity also attracted many participants .
however , it was a large expenditure to print and mail 1,000 post@@ cards .
so I brought the 1,000 post@@ cards to an outdoor jacket manufacturing company .
I told them , &quot; Now some people are willing to do charity works . we can take these post@@ cards to the North Pole to fulfill their charity dreams . could you help us financially ? &quot;
the company spoke highly of this activity and sponsored all my expenses on this trip , including the money for printing and mailing these post@@ cards , my tickets and other costs .
therefore , going to the South Pole and the North Pole is nothing remarkable .
what &apos;s remarkable is that we can help others turn their dreams into reality at no cost .
what I &apos;m trying to tell you is that life is an un@@ explored , unexpected trip .
you will never know what you are going to do next .
I didn &apos;t expect the trip to be free before I went to the South Pole , nor did I expect to go to the North Pole after my trip to the South Pole .
I had never thought these before .
in 2012 , many people worried whether 2012 was the end of the world , but in 20@@ 14 we know it wasn &apos;t .
my last message for you is that the day we surrender our dreams is the ap@@ ocaly@@ pse .
thank you all .
I &apos;ve just finished my work as the supporting male of the soap opera Spring in the Office .
I heard that many made fun of me for not being good @-@ looking enough to act .
let me make it clear . the director would like an instinc@@ tive actor as the president of a company in the opera , so they searched online &quot; The top ten handsome presidents in China . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how I stood out in the appraisal , but you won &apos;t believe who those candidates were .
how could I not be chosen among people like Jack Ma and Shi Yu@@ zhu ?
this reminds me of a famous saying by Jack Ma - A man of wisdom is often not good @-@ looking .
don &apos;t you think he is a perfect example of this saying ?
I personally think him as the most intelligent of our kind .
well , let &apos;s go down to the business . I &apos;m here today to share with you the lessons I learnt from my past life .
what is life ?
as for me , it is a journey .
a journey always has its destination , and all humans share a common one , whether you choose it or not , it is waiting for you at the end of life .
when reaching the destination , the greater ones can have their portraits on the wall ,
in China , places are limited , most of which have already been taken .
so , when you become aware of that , you really don &apos;t need to pursue it , for you can &apos;t avoid it anyway .
well then , what is the most important thing in life ?
I believe it &apos;s the process .
since it is a process , there will be laughs , tears as well as storms .
we always hear that a life without hardships would be incomplete .
from this point , I reckon my life to be more complete than any one of you .
you know what I mean .
back in 1990 , 24 years ago , I was a post graduate student pursuing a degree at the Nag@@ o@@ ya University .
I didn &apos;t mention that I was pursuing a doctor &apos;s degree , just keep it low .
at a regular result presentation , my supervisor I@@ tak@@ ura F@@ um@@ it@@ ada was not pleased with my work and said , &quot; Maybe you can write a paper with such a result back in your country , but it &apos;s not possible in Japan . &quot;
hearing this , I felt a sting in my vulnerable heart .
not being able to put up with it , I angrily slammed the materials down on the desk .
the action left me with only one option , for I actually had to make a decision .
what was my decision ?
it was to antagon@@ ize my supervisor ; what I chose was to leave Japan ; what I chose was to let go of the degree for which I was yearning and made strenuous efforts for five years , a degree that I would had acquired in merely six months .
many asked if I have ever regretted , regretted of the slam and the decision I made .
my answer was no , not because that choice led me to Microsoft and made me who I am today .
if I had not done so , I@@ tak@@ ura F@@ um@@ it@@ ada would never have said that I was the best of his students 20 years later ; If I had not done so , the president of the Nag@@ o@@ ya University would never have told me that I was a distinguished student of the university .
that choice mat@@ tered because it preserved a little of my dignity and made me more self @-@ assured before them .
later on , to make up for this , I took an on @-@ job postgraduate degree in a third @-@ rate university in America .
however , I didn &apos;t foresee a huge disturbance on the internet 20 years later .
a lot of people criticized me for my &quot; academic misconduct . &quot;
during that time , many asked if I felt depressed about it .
how could a man in that situation be depressed ?
I didn &apos;t feel that way but I did feel at rage and helpless .
then , how do you define depression ?
before the Spring Festival of this year when I saw a kid of my family smoking in the toilets , I said to him that it was inappropriate to smoke when he was in middle school .
&quot; I am depressed about the Di@@ ao@@ yu island issue . &quot; he answered .
that state of mind could be described as a sort of depression , but how could mine be like that ?
the same day as today twelve years ago , I was already the president of Microsoft China .
in those days , Internet industry was still at its infancy .
with Internet , what kind of applications is the most frequently used ?
the chatting apps .
at that time , Microsoft rolled out a chatting application called MS@@ N , whose market share was much larger than that of its twin in China , T@@ enc@@ ent Q@@ Q .
however , I found that the growth rate in user number of Q@@ Q was much higher than that of MS@@ N .
I noticed there was only one function of Q@@ Q that MS@@ N didn &apos;t have .
what is that ?
chatting with strangers , as you could see .
I told Gates that and warned him , &quot; We will lose to T@@ enc@@ ent if we don &apos;t provide that function . &quot;
&quot; why do Chinese people love to chat with strangers ? &quot; asked Gates .
&quot; that &apos;s a need of all humans ! &quot; I answered .
he didn &apos;t believe it and said , &quot; It must a particular need of Chinese men . &quot;
let &apos;s think about this , what kind of psychological states it takes for a man to chat with another man all day long ?
&quot; no , it &apos;s a mutual need &quot; I insisted .
Gates finally accepted my opinion and became willing to provide this function only to the Chinese market , with a condition , though .
the Microsoft China must promise that MS@@ N would gain 1.5 million dollars of income from advertising in three years to compensate the expenses in development and maintenance .
what in front of me was that I needed to make a decision , however , there is no other options .
why not ?
because I dared not .
why did I ?
because I cared the position too much to lose it , so I dropped the option .
what is the consequence of that decision ?
as we known , MS@@ N was finally we@@ eded out of the market last year .
I wonder that if I had made the decision then , perhaps the Internet pattern in China would have been changed dramatically ; if I had made the decision , maybe Ball@@ mer , who I appreciated so much , wouldn &apos;t have to resign .
I think that &apos;s why people say that the delight of life lies in infinite choices , for you can &apos;t foresee the consequences .
some asked me what the biggest lesson I learnt from all my experiences .
the answer was to have the courage to make choices .
another question is how I made it through in my most difficult times when I encountered hardships .
as for this , I &apos;d like to share with you Tang &apos;s method of bottom @-@ line stress reduction .
let &apos;s stay low @-@ ley and I &apos;ll just call it bottom @-@ line stress reduction method .
so , what is that ?
I just get prepared for the worst scenario and think of the countermeasures that you will take when the worst happens .
what will you do then ?
do you stand for the outcomes ?
when caught in the Internet disturbance a few years ago , I thought to myself that the worst scenario would be a divorce .
many said that &quot; Tang Jun , I can &apos;t believe what you think of now is women . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to be a man , you know , not to mention being a good one .
even so , I am well aware that half of the happiness of a man comes from a woman .
however , man is the single source of a woman &apos;s happiness .
when thinking about this , I feel quite relaxed .
this is how I relieved stress in my past life , with a so @-@ called bottom @-@ line stress reduction method that I decided .
I like to say that many of you here today don &apos;t need courage to be here at T@@ n@@ Dao .
before I put an end to my speech , I &apos;d like to say that you do have good tastes to come and listen to me .
thank you !
I &apos;m a lawyer .
I was asked by one of my friends a few days ago , &quot; You &apos;ve been in the business for more than 10 years , what &apos;s the most unforgettable thing in your mind ? &quot;
I think about it , and suddenly realize that the most unforgettable thing is not a case with over 100 million yuan of Subject of Contract , nor court hearings that took place at the Supreme People &apos;s Court .
you must find it unbelievable .
my most unforgettable case is one that involved only 4@@ 7@@ 5.@@ 83 yuan .
in 2005 , I handled a small case . at that time , I had only a few years &apos; law practicing experience .
my client was a new@@ comer to our city .
he rented an apartment there .
later he found a job in another city and therefore he needed to move out of the apartment early .
that is to say , he needed to cancel the house leasing contract with his landlord .
it was nothing complicated .
my client had paid deposit to his landlord , and it was up to the landlord to deduct any reasonable cost from the deposit .
it was a simple mathematics .
and eventually the landlord was required to return 4@@ 7@@ 5.@@ 83 yuan to my client .
it was rather simple , nothing complicated .
but this landlord seemed to be obsessed by some dev@@ il@@ ish idea , kept making all kinds of excuses and refused to return 4@@ 75 yuan to my client .
I guessed that he was thinking , &quot; You &apos;re a new@@ comer here , what can you do ? you can never have this 400 yuan back . &quot;
my client refused to accept it .
he entrusted a lawyer , which was me , and filed a lawsuit against his landlord in court .
it is such an insignificant matter , and by no means it should be escal@@ ated and become a lawsuit ?
however , to my big surprise , this landlord , by lever@@ aging his local connection , succeeded in winning the first @-@ instance judgment .
in other words , the court judgment said it was right for him not returning 4@@ 75 yuan .
let alone the feeling of my client .
it was a serious setback for me , a new lawyer in the business .
it would directly affect my outlook on life and the judgment on values .
in any case , we must file an appeal .
in the Court of second instance , we made our utmost efforts to fight for our point of view , presented convincing proof@@ s and finally the final judgment came out .
he was asked to return the money to my client .
but to my dis@@ belief , the case was never a simple one .
the landlord refused to accept the court judgment , and this case eventually entered the execution phase .
the execution phase was not complicated either .
the judge asked both liti@@ gan@@ ts and me into his office , and required the landlord to give 4@@ 75 yuan of cash to my client face to face .
one thing unexpected happened when we were about to leave the judge &apos;s office .
the landlord suddenly pointed angrily at my nose and shouted , &quot; Ren Zhi@@ jian , I &apos;m not afraid of you . let &apos;s wait and see . &quot;
at that moment , my brain liter@@ ately went blank .
I can &apos;t believe that this man will behavior in such a silly way for the sake of 4@@ 75 yuan .
I ended up leaving the Court from its back door .
it is a great fortune of me for not meeting this guy these years .
I hope that he won &apos;t be present for today &apos;s event ; otherwise I will be in trouble .
when looking back at this case , I now realize that it is more than a joke .
why is someone willing to break rules , to break simple rules of a house leasing contract , in exchange for 4@@ 75 yuan ?
is this psychological impulse something we are born with ?
in the past 30 years &apos; reform and opening up , China has made significant progress and development in its legal system construction .
however , we still see many bizarre social phenomena .
most of my clients are enterprises or institutions .
I have noticed one thing , whenever there are legal disputes , these bosses will immediately think of establishing a personal connection with three government officials , namely the mayor , head of the public security bureau and chief justice .
and for job reason , I often pay visits to these three government officials together with my clients .
one day I accompanied my friend to visit one official , who was president of a local intermediate people &apos;s court .
during our conversation , I noticed that this chief justice , in his 50s , knew very little about existing legal provisions and made arbitrary decisions simply based on his experiences .
out of kindness , I quietly handed over a printed copy of a specific legal provision to him .
the chief justice took a quick look at it and talked to me sne@@ er@@ ingly , &quot; It is nothing . we brothers have the final say of this matter . &quot;
wow , till this moment can you realize the power of br@@ agging .
why ?
why do our current law en@@ forc@@ ers and rulers often ignore the existence of rules and regulations ?
why do they often turn these rules and systems into tools to seek personal gains ?
why is there no such a sense of awe and admiration for the rules and systems in their hearts ?
is this what George W. Bush said about &quot; power not being locked up in a cage &quot; ?
many strange social phenomena happen in our society .
we just mentioned that law en@@ forc@@ ers and powerful people would violate rules , how about those ordinary people , people without any power , will they break any rule ?
will they make any attempt to cross the red line ?
about 10 years ago , a very strange case happened in the Northeast China region .
teachers from a school joined a group tour together during the summer vacation .
when the tour bus entered a rest area along a national road , a robber armed with a sharp blade appeared from nowhere .
it was a very young robber , approximately 14 to 15 years old ; and the sharp knife in his hand was very intim@@ idating .
by waving the knife , this young robber rans@@ acked the entire bus and demanded for money and personal belongings of every passenger .
just as the robber was about to get off the bus , he saw a beautiful young teacher sitting near the door of the bus , with a string of golden neck@@ lac@@ es around her neck .
the robber had an evil intention , and decided to grab the neck@@ lac@@ es around her neck .
this young teacher by instinct , assuming that this robber was going to rape her , started to resist aggressively .
and during this intense bodily contact , the female teacher &apos;s clothes were torn .
without further thinking , she immediately grabbed a bundle of books and slammed to the robber &apos;s head .
and the robber immediately lost consciousness .
it was only till this moment the remaining 20 teachers on the same bus got up and started punching and kicking the robber , who had already lost the resistance ability .
when the robber was transferred to local public security bureau , he was half dead and had only one remaining breath left .
why ?
we found out that at that moment , these 20 people , who called themselves &quot; teachers , &quot; had completely ignored the existence of the rules .
at that very moment , these 20 people freed the dev@@ ils in their hearts , totally forgetting the existence of rules and regulations within a society .
they also forgot that even robbers would have a legitimate right to stand trial .
in the sub@@ consciousness of our countrymen , are there no such feelings of awe and admiration for the rules and regulatory systems ?
I don &apos;t think so .
we can look back at our Chinese nation , a country with more than 2000 years of ideological and cultural history .
during the Spring and Autumn War@@ ring States Period more than 2,500 years ago , our Chinese society gave birth to the important ideas of Confucianism , Tao@@ ism , leg@@ alism , Mo@@ h@@ ism and so on .
studies of Chinese ancient civilization are very popular nowadays , but what I want to say is that these studies should not be considered as the studies of Confucianism alone .
let &apos;s talk about Mo@@ h@@ ist school of thought and leg@@ alist school of thought today .
when it comes to the understanding and reverence of the rules and regulatory systems , we must first talk about Mo@@ h@@ ist school of thought .
Mo@@ h@@ ist is an organization formed by highly disciplined people , and its leader was called Ju@@ zi .
about 400 A.@@ D.@@ during the War@@ ring States Period , Fu , the 4th generation of the Ju@@ zi &apos;s heir , lived in the Kingdom of Qin and Fu &apos;s son killed someone .
in line with the laws Fu &apos;s son should be executed .
king Hui@@ wen of Qin thought that Fu was already an old man , and had only one son , so the King decided not to kill Fu &apos;s son .
but Fu replied , &quot; The Mo@@ h@@ ist Law stipulates that the murderer must die and the one who has hurt others must receive corresponding pun@@ ish@@ ment@@ .This is the necessary means to prohibit killing and robbing , and in line with the world &apos;s righteousness . &quot;
so Fu decided to have his own son killed .
the story vividly displays the in @-@ depth understanding of rules and regulatory systems by Mo@@ hi@@ sts , and such an understanding has been lifted to a level that we can call awe or a religion .
is this very spirit not exactly what we need in a society that advocates rule of law ?
isn &apos;t it the very spirit for Chinese enterprises to manage their businesses nowadays ?
but how does this spirit come into being in the first place ?
I think it is necessary for us to explore the core of Mo@@ h@@ ist thought .
for more than 2000 years , the core value of Mo@@ h@@ ist thought has always been &quot; love . &quot;
the idea is that all people , including monarch and his subjects , fathers and sons , brothers and sisters , should treat each other nicely on the basis of equality and mutual love .
influenced by this simple concept of equality , Mo@@ hi@@ sts have grown a sense of respect or admiration for rules and regulatory systems , which is what we now call a rule @-@ of @-@ law so@@ ce@@ ity .
we can see that the philosophy of universal love helps create equality in a society , and en@@ su@@ ingly the equality helps build a rule @-@ of @-@ law social environment .
unfortunately , this important idea has not become the mainstream of society in the future .
about 2000 years ago , during the Western Han Dynasty in China , a scholar named Dong Zhong@@ sh@@ u and his master , Emperor Wu of Han , jointly launched a policy to reject the other schools of thought and respect only Confucianism .
under the guidance of this policy , the entire society followed a feudal hierarchy of &quot; monarch @-@ official , father@@ - son . &quot;
once this concept is proposed , there isn &apos;t any equality in our society , and the social environment that sust@@ ains the growth of legal systems ceases to exist .
this kind of concept continues to linger today , and still remains as an influential factor in China &apos;s society .
there are people who have violated rules and regulations , even broken the law ; however , because of their special background or special status , they end up receiving special treatment , some even enjoy special prev@@ il@@ id@@ ges when staying behind the bar .
some people , because of one of their family members being a senior government official , can enjoy special treatments when traveling , including escort by police cars and site cleaning prior of their visit to a tourist attraction .
some other people , because of their special status , are less fortune .
they might be captured by surveillance cameras when staying a hotel room with their girl@@ friends .
rule @-@ of @-@ law concepts , including freedom and equality , are badly needed in our society ; but these concepts are hard to come by .
luckily thanks to the arrival of the Internet era , we are able to see a glim@@ mer of hope .
in the Internet society that highlights de @-@ identification and decentralization , people are able to communicate freely .
in the Internet society , people create one after another communities based on simple but effective rules .
within these communic@@ ities where the concept of equality prevails , we are able to communicate freely as an equal entity .
I firmly believe that with the evolution of social systems and social trends , the human race will demand for a society that values freedom , equ@@ lity and a rule @-@ of @-@ law environment .
thank you .
as an official photographer of G@@ ob@@ i Desert Challenge , I have taken part in two Chall@@ eng@@ es , the eighth and the ninth .
for me , an amateur photographer , every participation taught me something new .
in the ninth G@@ ob@@ i Desert Challenge , with two cameras and four lenses , I got 6,@@ 5@@ 88 shots in total .
for photographers , It is such a pleasure to press the shutter , as memorable moments are forever recorded in this way .
when I was sorting out those photos , those images seemed to bring me back to the Challenge .
it took me about a week to categor@@ ise the pictures by school and by subject .
after categor@@ isation , I would see many images be projected onto my mind once I closed my eyes .
you would be touched by those bright smiles .
and , some pictures would not only impress you but also strike my heart@@ string .
take a look at this picture .
day of that Challenge , when I was on a helicopter .
I guess I was , um , 2 or 3 km away from the ground .
I used my Can@@ on EF 70 @-@ 200@@ mm lens to zoom in as much as possible , but you can only see a red flag in the vast G@@ ob@@ i Desert .
it is impossible to identify the flag @-@ bearer .
still , I admire the flag @-@ bearer a lot .
it was the fourth day ; everyone knows the participants had reached the limit physically and mentally at that time .
however , he ten@@ aciously bore the flag , struggled forward , amid the wind which challenged his stamina .
it is the flag @-@ bearer &apos;s responsibility to carry the flag .
in the G@@ ob@@ i Desert , flag @-@ be@@ arers don &apos;t represent themselves but their teams , their colleges .
I named my work A Sol@@ itary Trav@@ el@@ er .
I believe that only those with a strong heart are able the appreciate the solitude .
and this one , it was taken on the second day of the Challenge , the very first day of the real contest .
on that day , a level @-@ nine dust storm attacked us .
can you image a level @-@ nine dust storm ?
we had to stand like this in the storm .
you couldn &apos;t stand up straight at all .
when you look at this picture , you may think that in an extremely formidable environment only a common goal can present us this view .
did you see a team in the environment ?
among the team members , the one in camoufl@@ age showed the most ten@@ acity .
look , his hands were gri@@ pping firmly ; his arms was holding his teammates tightly .
with his head high and eyes forward , he was leading the team to march .
arm in arm , the five members in the front was a wall against the wind to protect others .
in their wake , 10 other members closely followed them , lowering their head .
at that moment , I was impressed by their strong team spirit .
that is the &quot; Sir Er@@ nest Sh@@ ack@@ leton spirit &quot; we are seeking for in the desert .
the name of the photo is The strength of the team .
during the four @-@ day challenge , the strength played its role all the way .
although the story varied from team to team , all touched and inspired members and enabled them to un@@ hes@@ it@@ at@@ ingly and stur@@ d@@ ily march on .
let &apos;s have a look at this picture .
you can see a back@@ lighting photography with a cuc@@ ol@@ or@@ is .
but it is not a perfect cuc@@ ol@@ ur@@ is .
two red flags were held al@@ oft , the flags of Ge@@ you Foundation .
the 20 members with various post@@ ures are distinctive , as well as energetic .
their roles in the foundation has nothing about their universities and colleges ; they are neutral in the foundation .
they have been to the G@@ ob@@ i Desert for many times . how impressive they are !
I know , aver@@ ag@@ ely , the 20 members have been to the G@@ ob@@ i Desert 3.5 times .
I think it is their rich and valuable experience in the Challenge that allows them to fulfill their potential along each routes , especially those challenging routes .
their presence in the Challenge aims to ensure the first @-@ time participants can enjoy their trip to the G@@ ob@@ i Desert light @-@ heartedly and daun@@ tlessly .
the G@@ ob@@ i Desert witnessed a variety of strengths , but I respect the strength of warmth most .
look , volunteer Wu Shu@@ yang was hu@@ gging Yang Han@@ lu@@ n who has intellectual disability .
what a big smile Yang Han@@ lu@@ n is wearing !
the open arms welcoming the arrivals means much more than words .
during the four days , you might have hugged many and might have been hugged a lot .
you may forgot who they are , but I am sure you remember all the warmth they gave .
when you couldn &apos;t make a step , or even when you couldn &apos;t utter a word , a warm hug from anonymous him or her offered you strengths and supported you to go on .
I believe the strength has been carved onto your heart .
our brains may forget things , but our hearts always reme@@ ber things clearly .
I hope the warmth , the strength can be retained in our heart , so I named the work W@@ arm@@ th .
this one was also taken on the first day of contest .
as I said , there was a severe dust storm ; you can see yellow sand was climbing over the camp inch by inch .
in the morning , a yellow spot appeared in the distance .
I learned from the organising committee that there was very likely to be a dust storm .
on hearing that news , I rushed back to my camp , and took out all cameras and tri@@ po@@ ds , as I knew I could have brilliant works in the extreme weather situation .
I got everything prepared . after about 30 minutes , sand got thicker , turning from yellow to brown .
the wind how@@ led with sands , overwhelming every voice in the camp .
at the beginning of the dust storm , you could see a yellow wall approaching forward silently .
but I never expected the dust storm would greet us in such a fer@@ vid way that my face was hurt by its kiss .
I was in an ecstasy after shooting all magnificent views , yes I was .
many photographers who did the same that day gave me a knowing smile .
after taking the pictures of yellow sand storm over@@ spreading the G@@ ob@@ i Desert , I turned around and noticed our team members had gathered together in front of the gate , neat and uniform , high@@ spirited and vigorous , ready to set out .
in that environment , probably , they were frightened ; they may fl@@ inch , but in reality , they started off with boundless enthusiasm .
no matter why they did so , maybe because of their self @-@ esteem or their wild ambition , they were courageous .
the picture always makes me recall a saying : every start leads to the destination .
I named it Start off .
this picture was also taken on the first day of the contest .
after photograph@@ ing all the 31 teams starting off like a great flood , I was looking up pictures .
I looked up , saw three figures in the front .
I zo@@ omed in as much as I could because of poor visibility .
I saw , oh , Hou Bin , a famous Paraly@@ mp@@ ics champion .
despite of the hostile environment , he showed up in the Challenge resolutely .
he was fear@@ less in the Challenge .
you may be good at running , so you can finish the 112 km route within four days , but Hou Bin is slow walker .
it took him four years to finish the 112 km route .
it takes four years for him and four days for us to complete the same route , the same distance .
but I think , the meaning of his completion is special .
from my perspective , walking and running are just a way to conquer the 112 km .
through the route , we fulfilled our potential .
the day when you complete the 1@@ 12@@ km route is the day when you out@@ do yourself , the day when you overcome your weakness .
hence , I named the photo the Jour@@ ney to Gre@@ at@@ ness .
thank you !
good morning , everyone !
the conference personnel are very considerate , they said , &quot; Hou Bin , in your case , it would be better to share your story on a chair . &quot;
but I insisted , I insisted standing before my audience .
now I &apos;m standing firmly here .
that &apos;s the spirit .
many people are curious about my experiences and stories .
when I was 9 years old , I lost my left leg in a railway accident .
the change that happened to me was in fact caused by our society .
after that tragedy , my classmate took me to school in bike while my father took up the hardest job of carrying logs in his workplace to support the family .
30 years ago , people with disabilities had to work as cob@@ bl@@ ers and blind mas@@ se@@ urs .
but I was so lucky that I received many help and saw the silver lining and the future .
at a time , I saw a sc@@ ence of a competition for the disabled on TV .
I questioned myself and I said , &quot; I want to be a person in the game , not an audience of other people &apos;s life . &quot;
so I asked my neighbor where the sports school is and my neighbor said , &quot; It &apos;s in Ji@@ ad@@ ong Sub @-@ district . &quot;
since I lived in Ji@@ ax@@ i Sub @-@ district , I had to ride a bike to the sports school to find a coach .
I went there over and over again , looking for a coach to teach me , but coaches of ice hockey , running and long jump all turned me down .
on my seventh trip , I begged a high jump coach , &quot; Please keep me in your team , otherwise I won &apos;t leave . &quot;
that coach had no choice but accepted me as his student .
thanks to him , I had the opportunity to fulfill my dream .
since then , I ped@@ aled from my home to the sport school for training everyday .
time flew quickly .
as the winter came , I had already been to the school for 9 months .
every time I arrived at the school , I would ask my team members to let me in the room before training to warm myself up because it was biting cold on the way there .
one day , no one answered the door .
then I heard our team leader whispering to other members in the room , &quot; Don &apos;t let him in . let him freeze to death ! &quot;
though I wore much with a cotton hat , a thick coat and a scarf , I was freezing and desperate for room to warm myself up .
however , no one opened the door for me .
I didn &apos;t ask for too much , all I wanted was a warm place , which I could not have at that time .
it was because I had made much progress and our coach had attached more importance to me that the elder team players got jealous .
so he did not want others to open the door for me , nor that I could go to the training .
it was the coach who showed up to save me again in that evening .
his encouragement and care helped me seek out the seed of hope in the adversity .
after three years of hard training , I took part in the national games for the disabled in 1995 and broke the national high jump record with 1.@@ 86 m . check this out .
however , when I made that score in 1995 , not a single spectator on the stands cheered .
after I landed on the cushion , I spoke to myself , &quot; Hou Bin , can you cheer for yourself when no one else do ? you should believe that you will receive massive applause one day as long as you keep going . &quot;
here is a very special photo .
guess what &apos;s it ?
it &apos;s a rack for routine exercises of high jump .
I dismantled it from the fence around my grandmother &apos;s house and took it to the sport school as my training tool .
you will find out that when people strive forward to meet their goals , what they overcome is actually their inner self .
in the case of high jump , once a high jumper fails , the cross@@ bar is sure to drop .
the failed attempt may not be taken seriously .
however , facing the rack as my cross@@ bar in the sport school , I told myself that every time I failed , I was bound to hurt myself on abdomen .
so I had to ensure the suc@@ ces of each leap in every contest as well as daily training ; the training of high standard guarantees a brighter future .
at that time , I set 2 meters a life goal for my high jump .
to this day , I make 1.@@ 94 meters on one leg .
in 20@@ 18 Paralympic Games , my life reached the peak when I lit the Paralympic torch in front a sea of spectators .
actually , every people will receive countless help and care at their turning point in life .
that day when I was in the Bird &apos;s N@@ est .
when I was in the ready room 8 hours before my show , a volunteer came to kindly inform me , &quot; No.1 , you are on in 8 hours . please get ready . &quot;
I said , &quot; O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; I guess you haven &apos;t had your meal , &quot; I added .
&quot; I haven &apos;t eaten my food yet . &quot; I continued .
&quot; have some of mine please . &quot;
so he ate some and went out of the Bird &apos;s N@@ est to check the site .
the wind blew extremely hard that day , he looked back at me as if he were thinking about me and my kindness .
therefore , he returned later and reminded me again , &quot; No.1 , you are on in 6 hours . Andy Lau is singing right now on the stage . &quot;
&quot; all right . &quot; I replied .
then I said to myself , &quot; You are going to lit the torch , may as well dress up a bit . &quot;
so I put a generous amount of m@@ ousse on my hair to style it .
since there was no mirror and the volunteer came in , so I asked him &quot; How does my hair look ? &quot;
he said , &quot; No.1 your hair looks great but when I was outside I found it was windy today . what if the flame of the torch fan@@ ned by the strong wind burns your hair ? in that case , we will have two tor@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; does that sounds alright ? , &quot; he asked .
&quot; no , of course not ! &quot;
those who help others will be helped .
before the ceremony , a media reporter wished to get some behind @-@ the @-@ scene stories , for example , how I lit the torch and how I climbed .
but most of all , what I was thinking at the height of 39 meters in the air .
when he asked me the last question , I answered , &quot; I wish to get down to the earth as fast as possible . &quot;
he said , &quot; We are covering the stories behind the athletes in the Olympic Games . do you get it , No.1 torch bearer ? &quot;
what did he mean ?
he meant that every one would be wondering the secret of torch lighting and my thoughts in the air the moment I lighted the torch .
I said , &quot; I am so scared that I want to get down quickly . &quot;
he ret@@ or@@ ted , &quot; No , a hero will never say something like that . you must have a dream or an idea that supports you to linger on . &quot;
I answered , &quot; No , I don &apos;t . &quot;
he insisted , &quot; Yes , you certainly do . &quot;
I refu@@ ted , &quot; The one who does the show has a say . &quot;
the second day , the reporter came to the rehearsal site and told the director , &quot; I want to go up there and figure out what No.1 thinks in the air . &quot;
the director rejected , &quot; Sorry but they have signed security agreement . &quot;
&quot; what &apos;s the agreement about ? &quot; asked the reporter .
&quot; it means that if you drop and bang , we bear zero responsibility . &quot;
I listened aside wondering , &quot; Yeah , I remember my agreement , but wait , it was so dark the day I signed it . I saw barely anything . &quot;
finally , the direc@@ ter gave in and let him try after he signed the security agreement .
the next we were practicing the wire fu , it was not shooting for the torch lighting .
a wire was attached around your waist to elevate you and you are lifted by a pul@@ ley system and a control room .
when climbers were elevated at the height of ten meters , the person in charge would talked to each clim@@ ber via a walk@@ ie @-@ talk@@ ie , &quot; Are you scared ? &quot;
if the clim@@ ber answered , &quot; Neg@@ ative . &quot;
then he went higher .
&quot; are you afraid ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m fine . &quot;
a little higher again .
&quot; are you scared ? &quot;
they would let you sway a little in the air for it was windy .
if that did not scare you , you would be spun around since there was a pul@@ ley .
the next day , the reporter had his belt wired , his machine on and here he went .
it was necessary for everyone to have a walk@@ ie @-@ talk@@ ie but I had his .
it was not that I hold it back on purpose , he just didn &apos;t as@@ ke for it .
in case that the walk@@ ie @-@ talk@@ ie went wrong , we were trained of simple gestures .
if you wanted to go down , you should open your palm with your thumb downward .
if you wanted to go up , then the thumb should face upward . the reporter was too impatient to grasp the rule .
however , when he was off the ground about 12 meters , he was so anxious to quit that he made the wrong gesture .
therefore , the person in charge was mis@@ led to elevate him higher and higher to 14 meters and 15 meters , indicated by the lines behind his back .
at that time , I asked my teamm@@ ate , &quot; Well , why is he kicking in the air ? &quot;
my teamm@@ ate and also my other feet , replied &quot; I have no idea . I have only one leg just like you . &quot;
while we were discussing , the reporter was elevated to 26 meters .
believing he was a tough guy , the technician in charge started sw@@ aying him horizontally .
mis@@ led by the reporter &apos;s continuous wrong gestures , the technician gave him a thumb up and spun him around .
he was already over 30 meters above the ground since he was elevated at a rather high speed .
I talked to the control room via the reporter &apos;s walk@@ ie @-@ talk@@ ie &quot; Something is wrong , he is a reporter and this is his first time , please let him down . &quot;
the moment he was gently brought down to the ground , I rushed towards him .
his face was already pale when he landed .
looking at him , I asked , &quot; Can you tell me now what is the dream that kept you in the air ? I sincerely hope that you can share your feelings with me , will you ? &quot;
he rolled his eyes and said , &quot; The one who does the show has a say . &quot;
after 2008 , I began to dream bigger and I told myself that I could share more stories with the world .
I went to the US and England to spread the Chinese spirits and advocate the power of China with many international leaders .
people will say that you are so talented even when you just make some small achievements in one area of life , such as math , sports or literature and art .
however , I am willing to break this talent .
it is commonly consider@@ ated that a man with one leg will trip when he walks , however , I chose to be a high jumper .
when preparing for the 2008 Paralympic Games , my teamm@@ ate out@@ performed me with greater upper body strength , holding that was the weak spot of a high jumper .
however , after half a month of unremitting exercises , I beat him by climbing 39 meters to light the torch on the opening ceremony of the games .
how could a one @-@ leg man go that far ?
this year , I have completed a successful 138 km in total in the 4 @-@ year races of G@@ ob@@ i March .
thanks to all the people who have helped me .
the dreams in your life are not determined by your action , but the broad@@ ness of your mind .
I have reached another goal on my to @-@ do list since I went on expedi@@ tions to the North and South Pol@@ es three years ago .
many people said , &quot; Hou Bin , story telling can never be a real profession . &quot;
well , to this day , I have already delivered 1,500 speeches around the world .
from now on , I have another goal for myself , &quot; Hou Bin , you have to live and love your country , you have to live until 120 years old . &quot;
this is my new goal , a goal for life .
many people tend to set goals for wealth at the expense of their health and future .
with a 120 @-@ year lifes@@ pan , you will break the time into each day to figure out how to live .
till this day , I still don &apos;t drink and I don &apos;t smoke .
I have no complaints about the society because I am always grateful to all the caring persons who have helped me and I will continue to move on .
some people may say , &quot; No kidding , Hou Bin . how can you make it to 120 when it is difficult to live to 80 ? &quot;
I know you don &apos;t believe it , so see you in 100 years .
as a successful entrepreneurs and challeng@@ er in G@@ ob@@ i March , I am ready to return to the society and our country .
I have joined hands with Xiamen University and its business schools to help disabled children stand up for the past several years .
we refuse looking on with arms folded at the children who lost their legs in earthquakes , accidents or car accidents .
they have already lost their legs but we &apos;re willing to help them with our experiences .
we want to help them stand on their feet with the best artificial legs in the world .
30 years ago , I gained warmth from the society and the care that I have received all along made me who I am today .
I believe that every entrepreneur here will be the dominant power to un@@ remit@@ tingly strive for a better society .
please don &apos;t stand by in@@ differently .
in Nanjing two children were star@@ ved to death at home because of the indifferent neighbors and the cruel society .
but we are also touched when we saw members of Comp@@ assion Relief T@@ zu Chi Foundation continually help those in need one year after the Xiamen &apos;s BR@@ T was burnt .
when we constantly change ourselves for the better , please don &apos;t sit by when others in need .
we can do a lot to help others and cheer them up .
as long as we keep going , China will become better and better .
thank you !
thanks !
recently I &apos;ve been intrigu@@ ed by something very interesting .
if you ask me what I do for a living , I &apos;d say I am a coach in influence .
that might sound too abstract .
I &apos;ll explain it a little bit , since all of us here , including many of my colleagues , might be very interested in this term &quot; influence . &quot;
what I do is , in short , help my clients summarize their thoughts , express their ideas and thus enhance their influence on other people .
to make sure I can do a great job on that , I &apos;ve done a lot of preparation work .
a book I translated was recently published in China . its name is &quot; How To Deli@@ ver A T@@ ED Talk : secrets Of The World &apos;s Most In@@ spir@@ ing Pres@@ ent@@ ations . &quot;
you might be very curious about what exactly influence is , and how we can make ourselves influential .
at the beginning of my speech today , I &apos;ll first say something about the clients I &apos; ve met in the past few years , many of whom were senior executives or CEOs .
now you guess , what was the most frequent question those smart people asked me ?
why were they interested in influence ?
I remember being always asked , &quot; How can I become someone successful like him ? &quot;
or , &quot; Can you help me become that person ? &quot;
I would only disappoint them by replying , &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ r@@ y.@@ I can &apos;@@ t.@@ You are never going to be Jack Ma or Steve Jobs , because you are not them . &quot;
if I can help you become someone that is not yourself at all , I guess I might as well become a witch first .
I am thinking about one thing right now : many people seem to care about influence , but why ?
only in this era is the influence on others so treas@@ ured .
so what exactly is influence ?
I &apos;ll quote and adapt the famous English writer Charles Dickens &apos; words here to explain why influence is drawing so much attention .
it is the best of times , for wisdom is omni@@ present ; it is the worst of times , for wisdom is everywhere .
more specifically speaking , it is a good thing today that many people are willing to teach , guide and influence others .
but if they over@@ do it , things might back@@ fire .
we will finally find ourselves stuck in a dilemma , where we can either influence others , or be influenced by others .
speaking of influence , I guess many people might wonder what constitute it .
why is influence so important for you ?
now I want to ask you something : what role are micro@@ blog and We@@ Chat playing in your life ?
please raise your hand if you use the two social @-@ media tools .
though I can &apos;t see quite clearly , I am sure almost everyone here is raising your hand .
I &apos;ll tell you a cruel fact : as long as you follow more than one hundred people on micro@@ blog or We@@ Chat , rest assured , you are , if information can be quanti@@ fied , consuming as much information every day as the 18th century farmers did in their whole life .
scary , right ?
but that &apos;s an awkward truth belonging to this age .
you &apos;ve said something , but that doesn &apos;t mean you have influence .
your message might just be drowned .
even if your words are heard , they might be interpreted differently due to differences in comprehension , educational background and temperament .
when I give many clients counseling services , they will ask me , &quot; I have conveyed my message , but why do people react differently ? &quot;
there is a joke that &apos;s often told about a programmer .
the programmer &apos;s wife phoned him when he was on his way back home .
she said , &quot; Get me one kg of steamed stuffed bun@@ s on your way back . and if you see someone selling water@@ mel@@ ons , get one for me . &quot;
finally the programmer got home , with one stuffed bun in his hand .
it might take a little while to get the punch line .
so I &apos;ll repeat the joke .
the programmer &apos;s wife phoned him when he was on his way back home .
she said , &quot; Get me one kg of steamed stuffed bun@@ s on your way back . and if you see someone selling water@@ mel@@ ons , get one for me . &quot;
when the programmer got home , he had only one stuffed bun in his hand .
his wife asked him why , and he answered that he was precisely following the If @-@ then logic .
you see , one &apos;s influence is always limited .
the time when lectures will be in@@ discrimin@@ ately listened to is forever gone , no matter how high @-@ ranking the lecturer is .
in today &apos;s society , if a per@@ func@@ tory lecture draws listeners , I &apos;ll think the listeners are great .
I mean , truly great .
this photo was secretly shot during the two sessions of China .
you can hardly find anyone that is awake .
look at our big guy Yao Ming .
well , he is opening his eyes wide , but actually he is also sleepy .
he just dare not sleep for fear that , given his supper height , his every move will be easily caught by the speakers in the front .
here a problem is revealed : we are facing very intense competition today .
that &apos;s why it is necessary for all of us here to think about what true influence is .
in my opinion , everybody has his own influence .
it is not just that I stand here today to influence you .
you are also influencing me .
your reaction is exerting a profound influence on me .
what exactly is influence ?
this is the most important question I pose today .
according to Ci@@ hai , influence means one &apos;s capacity to change the thoughts and behavior of other people .
for me this definition is a bit too rough and sounds like some mysterious power owned by gods or demons .
what is influence ?
I &apos;ll explain it with a picture , which I think is a perfect illustration of influence .
it &apos;s a very simple picture .
but I wish you could give it a really close look and try to figure out why it contains the connotation of influence .
simple as it is , the picture might precisely reflect what true influence should be like .
now look at this M &amp; M &apos;S chocolate peanut , do you have the feeling that this red one has a peculiar ench@@ ant@@ ment - and it just intri@@ gues us ?
now suppose you have to handle the red chocolate peanut in two different ways .
think what different feelings you will have then .
the first way is to pick up the red chocolate peanut , throw it among the yellow ones and then mix them up .
how will you feel ?
just a bunch of chocolate peanuts , you might say , let &apos;s eat them .
or you could think from a different angle .
suppose you paint the red chocolate peanut with a different color , say , yellow , and leave it where it is right now .
will it be as charming as before ?
I really doubt that .
the picture reveals two things about influence .
first , your influence is dependent on your position .
whether you are a chocolate peanut or not , whatever you may look like , whatever color you are painted with , your position decides your influence .
so long as you are willing to come out , you will be noticed and heard .
during my counseling sessions with the clients , I found that a universal problem with the clients was that they never spoke in public .
nor did they feel that necessary .
they were easy to feel nervous , and preferred to be in@@ conspicuous in the crowd .
my response to their problem was , &quot; No matter what you say on the stage , so long as you come to the stage and give others a chance to observe you from a certain angle , so long as you insert an interval between you and them , you will have influence . &quot;
second , if you are just a yellow chocolate , like all the other yellow chocolate peanuts around you , even though you are put on center stage , you will have little influence .
but if you make yourself red , then everything will be different .
actually , every one of us has an inner red chocolate peanut .
so where can we find it ?
always remember that it lies in where we are different from others .
similar exploration into influence could even be traced back to thousands of years ago .
there is an example from the time of the cav@@ emen .
now , I bet that , on hearing the word &quot; cav@@ emen , &quot; you will instantly pr@@ ick up your ears .
what I am doing is unimportant to you , but the word &quot; cav@@ emen &quot; is irresistible .
so what exactly is the example ?
let me tell you this story .
here , please pay attention .
no matter whether this is going to be a good story , people just can &apos;t wait to listen to it .
like the good lecturer before me .
did you notice that , no matter what message he wanted to convey , when he mentioned he would tell a story that had deeply touched him , he was making his story a carrier of great influence ?
in my opinion , influence requires two important things .
first , authenticity .
many people may not be convinced of their own influence unless they think or act like somebody else who is successful .
they are careful to imitate others &apos; manners , gestures and looks .
I often told my clients that all those efforts at imitation are futile .
you can never become a person who is not you .
if you admire Jack Ma , that &apos;s OK .
but if you want to become him , that &apos;s extremely hard .
there is a person who is very influential on the internet these days .
his name is Luo Yong@@ hao , and he has just launched his Ham@@ mer phone . I happen to have some short @-@ term ties to him during work .
using what humble experience I have accumulated in lec@@ turing , I can find that when Luo Yong@@ hao was giving his speech during the product presentation , he was not at his best , given the way how he frequently paced up and down and fid@@ dled with his laser pointer , combined with his not @-@ so @-@ perfect voice and tone .
but one thing is clear : no matter what you think of this person or his product , he is very successful in attracting investment .
the most important reason for that would be an influence based on authenticity .
on the stage you might look as if you are shrinking back , because that &apos;s the way you are .
if you say , &quot; I am shy with people and I &apos;d prefer to stay unnoticed , &quot; that &apos;ll be OK .
hang back as you should .
but if amazing ideas can flow out of your mouth even under that obs@@ cured circumstance , that will definitely earn you extra credits .
there is a book listed among Amazon &apos;s best books .
its author is named Susan Cain , who is also a T@@ ED lecturer .
I think it &apos;s really a good book .
the name is Qui@@ et ： The Power of intro@@ ver@@ ts in a World that Can &apos;t Stop Tal@@ king .
there is a very convincing idea in this book , namely that the power of intro@@ ver@@ ts lies in their calm state , in which they could think deeply and produce something beyond expectation .
aside from authenticity , the second thing required by influence , as the foregoing implies , is uniqueness .
you can &apos;t be an ordinary yellow chocolate peanut .
instead , you must become the red one , which is both authentic and unique .
uniqueness means you can present something that people might not notice or know about .
for example , a friend of mine called Gary often gives me the same example when we talk about uniqueness .
if during a lecture , the voice , appearance and manners of the lecturer are all perfect , if the lecture is by no means lacking in content or logic , yet it just keeps el@@ uding your ears , can you think of the reason ?
the lecturer &apos;s look , voice and gestures are all expressive .
the content is of high quality , and what &apos;s more important , closely related with what you need .
but you just don &apos;t want to listen .
so what are you thinking ?
I &apos;ll tell you why .
I take nearly seventy flights every year .
you might all have heard one lecture on board : the safety precautions .
oxygen masks are over your head .
life jackets are under your seat .
but you can also see that passengers just ignore what they hear .
why ?
because there is nothing unique .
passengers have already heard the same words repeatedly for hundreds of times .
only one sort of person would listen very carefully .
who ?
travellers who take flight for the first time .
in other words , if we present the safety precautions in a different way , I guess no passenger on board would bear to distract themselves while listening .
for example , we can start the instructions with this sentence : please get seated and look out the left window .
the engine of the plane is already ign@@ ited .
that &apos;s uniqueness .
you should use something others don &apos;t notice to express your ideas .
that reminds of a theory that I never quite agree with .
it &apos;s called the Short P@@ late Theory .
if a cas@@ k has a short plate , water will easily spill out .
so the short plate must be viewed as a priority to be mended .
but the problem is that , when you concentrate all your energy on fixing the short plate , the short plate will finally become no more than an ordinarily long plate , just like one of the ordinary yellow chocolate peanuts I mentioned earlier .
you spend twenty years in bridging the gap between your weakness and others &apos; strength , so what ?
that tells a lot about the logic of influence .
Einstein once said , &quot; Everyone is a genius . but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree , it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid . &quot;
it will finally realize that all his labor might be a silly mistake .
so here I &apos;d like to sum up the true constituents of influence : authenticity and uniqueness .
if you ask me how we can be authentic and unique , you may take a good look at the Chinese inspir@@ ational stories telling how pen@@ n@@ il@@ ess young people reverse their fate .
almost all those stories are successfully circulated in the business world , because they follow the logic of influence : authentic and unique .
take Yu Min@@ hong for example .
he said he used to live in a 3 @-@ square @-@ meter basement with his wife , and hadn &apos;t been abroad when he was thirty .
compared with his friends , his life was terribly miserable .
you might respond , &quot; W@@ ow , that &apos;s what real life is like ! &quot;
then do you know how he has reversed his fate ?
because he suddenly changed the subject and said , &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day I had a dinner with Warren Buffett . &quot;
that is a good example of how to enhance one &apos;s influence .
I &apos;ll emphasize my point again : influence comes from authenticity and uniqueness .
who stole our influence ?
the answer for me is our misunderstanding .
who specifically stole our influence ?
the del@@ usion that we should become someone else stole our influence .
you can never be somebody else .
you can only be yourself .
last , I &apos;d like to end my speech with Oscar Wil@@ de &apos;s words : be yourself , because everyone else is already taken .
be yourself , because everyone else is already taken .
thank you !
a few days ago , I got a call from one of the boys from my class , &quot; Xing Ji@@ aw@@ en , I heard that you are going to give a speech titled Bo@@ ys Are U@@ seless on the 29th day . &quot;
what an over@@ blown worry it is . life is short . if boys really are useless , why do we girls waste our time saving them ?
actually , there is a story behind this call .
last year we held a class meeting them@@ ed on S@@ aving the Bo@@ ys .
even studying in the best class in my school , one of the decent schools in Shanghai , we girls still often come across such things .
for example , we girls have to make all the p@@ pts for classroom activities and write the scripts for textbook @-@ based dramas , and we were always the last to leave on cleaning days while the boys were nowhere to be seen .
what &apos;s more , we out@@ perform the boys in exams .
as a result , girls and teachers can &apos;t help wondering : where are the good boys ?
therefore , we held a class meeting them@@ ed on &quot; S@@ aving the Bo@@ ys . &quot;
compelled by the pressure of the theme , every boy in my class seemed to &quot; come forward &quot; and gab@@ bled about how to be a good boy , and his plans about the future .
they even invited my father , whom they thought to be a role model of successful man , to the meeting to share his opinions .
well , I don &apos;t think he &apos;s that successful .
N@@ ever@@ thel@@ ss , I do hope he set an example for the boys in my class and encouraged them to be better men .
on the meeting , the girls cited examples from the past and modern days , so to speak , the whole meeting was full of our sincere care and expectations for the boys .
as an ending note , the girls and teachers all agreed that the meeting was a huge success .
after the meeting , we held inspiring events , such as the Top 10 Good Bo@@ ys , asking the girls to vote for the good boys in their eyes .
as a old saying goes , &quot; only time will tell . &quot;
regrettably , one year after the meeting , the girls are still to@@ iling over p@@ pts .
last August , I joined a coming @-@ of @-@ age ceremony in the G@@ ob@@ i Desert .
in the sor@@ ching hot season , me and other nearly 70 teenagers my age from other places in China re@@ visited the toughest part that Xu@@ an@@ z@@ ang , a Chinese monk who travelled to India in the seventh century for Buddhist scrip@@ tures , had travelled through in his journey to the west .
we had to travel 88 kilometers in just 4 days .
as a head student for years and the master@@ mind of S@@ aving the Bo@@ ys , I had already prepared to be a tough girl in the journey .
I started to worry since the first day in the G@@ ob@@ i Desert , as I found that the boys significantly out@@ numbered the girls and they assumed all the key posts , such as team leader , the standard @-@ bearer , etc .
a boy nick@@ named &quot; ti@@ ghts &quot; for being one of the thin@@ nest boys in the team was our scout .
in the middle of our journey , we got lost and no one was sure where to go .
he came forward and volunteered to scout the way ahead .
his he@@ oric act worried us all because it &apos;s dangerous to be lost in a wild and sandy desert .
despite of all the potential dangers , he went on his way .
when his thin figure appeared alongside a huge rock , we all got excited .
with his help we were finally able to go back on the right path .
I was deeply impressed by his courage and devotion to the team .
the other boy I want to talk about is our team leader .
we didn &apos;t follow the tradition to elect the leader by voting on the candidates &apos; speeches .
instead , we picked out a man who looks most experienced and prudent .
his name is Ling Feng , a boy who is shy and quiet .
the main duty of the leader is to wrap things up , so Ling Feng had to stay at the tail of the team , never having the chance to be the first to reach the finishing line .
furthermore , he had to take care of the wounded and remind other members to sat@@ y hydr@@ ated .
at the same time , he had to be the liaison , always carrying portable char@@ gers and the medical kit with him .
despite of the heavy and complicated tasks , he never complained to us .
the list of similar stories in the desert goes on and on .
in our journey , those brave boys were exactly the heroes we expected them to be .
thanks to their dedication , we were able to feel safe and protected as if we were roses in the desert , only without thor@@ nes .
speaking of the word &quot; role , &quot; it simply means what we think we are and how we act accordingly .
at the thought of words like the G@@ ob@@ i Desert , independence and man , even the boys who set out on their first journey in the desert would man up unconsciously to protect the girls .
see , the role is so magical that it can change our behavioral patterns .
but here comes another question , that is , why do &quot; ti@@ ghts &quot; and the leader have better performance than the rest of the boys in my team ?
in order to solve this problem , I will introduce another term , role definition .
role definition means the particular position or function you have in a situation or in the society . in my team , &quot; ti@@ ghts &quot; is not just a boy , but also the one and only scout .
this is exactly his role definition .
this is the same case with my leader .
being the only leader in that team , Ling Feng has to fulfill many duties by himself .
being unique and irreplaceable , that &apos;s the definition of the roles of those two boys .
by playing an irreplaceable role , one can transcend from being good to being excellent .
if I recall correctly , I earned my place as the head student first when I was in the 6th grade .
at that time , the head student was required to write a brief summary every week , and read it out on every Monday .
it &apos;s hard to forget the first time I stood at the podium , holding a tiny summary paper in my hand .
my heart beat so hard and I felt like there was a rabbit jumping fur@@ iously in my chest .
the only thing I could do at that moment was keep telling myself &quot; you are the head student . &quot;
it took me one week to overcome that nervousness .
as we moved to higher grade levels , I often had to stay up late at night tending the class affairs , after which I had to finish enormous school@@ work before going to bed .
looking at the elementary exercises I had done for countless times , sometimes I really wanted to mud@@ dle through them by copying answers .
it is said that staying up late will accelerate the ageing of a woman .
that &apos;s definitely something I want to avoid as a young girl .
whenever I want to take a quick look at the answers , a voice would scream in my heart , &quot; you are the head student . &quot;
it is this voice that saved me from dis@@ hon@@ oring my title .
then , I accepted the truth that I might age faster than my classmates .
little did I know about role definition at that time , but now when@@ ver I look back on that experience , I can be sure this is the magic of role definition .
it is with that magic one can forge ahead , ha@@ v@@ ing@@ t hesitation or regret , and withstand the tear and wear of time .
are boys really in need of salvation ?
in my eyes , all we need to do is tell them that they are men , pioneers and leaders .
&quot; Dao &quot; in Chinese is an interesting concept .
it can refer to &quot; speech , &quot; &quot; the principles behind words &quot; or &quot; the way of fr@@ aming one &apos;s words . &quot;
we grow up with certain common @-@ sense truths .
and we regard them as the doctrines that we should act by .
there is a saying goes , &quot; three cob@@ bl@@ ers with their wits combined exceed that of Z@@ HU@@ GE Liang , the master@@ mind . &quot;
we would all agree that when something happens , it is of little use to seek the opinions of the experts .
there is a high possibility that the so @-@ called professors and scholars knew no better than we do .
however , deep inside we all wish to be &quot; the master mind &quot; of all time rather than the &quot; cob@@ bl@@ ers . &quot;
however , what if we can &apos;t be the &quot; master mind &quot; ?
in that case , we can find two more &quot; cob@@ bl@@ ers &quot; and pull our strength together to outw@@ it the &quot; master mind . &quot;
we hear this saying so often that we start to believe teamwork will always work .
if we all contribute to the discussions , we can always come up with a solution , or a good idea .
however , if you give a second thought on this saying , you will find it problematic .
is there anyone who has read the Rom@@ ance of the Three King@@ doms ?
it is said the best way to read the Rom@@ ance of the Three King@@ doms is to start from the middle part rather than from the beginning .
then which chapter should we start with ?
the chapter of &quot; Three Vis@@ its to the That@@ ched Cot@@ tage . &quot;
in the first half of the novel , Liu Bei suffered defeat repeatedly , but in the latter half , he achieved victory one after another .
why ?
it is because of Z@@ huge Liang .
therefore , the key lies in the &quot; master mind &quot; of the group .
the saying &quot; three cob@@ bl@@ ers with their wits combined exceed that of Z@@ HU@@ GE Liang , the master@@ mind &quot; tells only part of the story .
in fact , it is only a well @-@ int@@ entioned day@@ dream to assume that &quot; three cob@@ bl@@ ers with their wits combined could exceed that of Z@@ HU@@ GE Liang , the master@@ mind &quot; .
we all know that even when three &quot; master minds &quot; work together , they would end up with a worse outcome , not to mention the &quot; cob@@ bl@@ ers . &quot;
actually , research in social psychology has proven that when people gather , they tend to act in a similar way as the rest of the group .
this &quot; infection &quot; will lead to a very interesting psychological phenomenon , in which everyone want to get approval from others .
as an old Chinese saying goes , &quot; when two people get into a quarrel , they will ask a third one to judge who is right regardless of the intelligence of the third party . &quot;
do we have a similar experience in our lives ?
when we get into a quarrel with a colleague , a friend , or a relative , we automatically go to another person and regard him as a judge .
at first , we were just arguing who is right and who is wrong , but without even realizing it , we started trying to win the support of the third party while proving the other party as wrong .
as a result , we will find that the original positions and ideas of both parties began to change .
this is because we behave differently under the influence of the companion we keep .
therefore , this is the same case when the three &quot; cob@@ bl@@ ers &quot; come together and have a discussion .
at first , each of them had their own position , but as the discussion progressed , they began to accommodate to others &apos; opinions to win their support .
this happens not only among a group of &quot; cob@@ bl@@ ers &quot; but also among a crowd of senior staff and el@@ ites .
why ?
why do people become stupid when we are together ?
it is an easy question .
it is because consciously or unconsciously , we all want to be recognized by others .
to be recognized , we would have to adjust our position and appeal to others , and lower our IQ .
in my experience of doing TV shows , I found a phenomenon that will easily affect the position of the TV guest .
that is , too much care about the audience ratings will automatically lower our intelligence level .
I once did some live TV shows .
I paid attention to not only the audience ratings on the whole but also that by minute .
why did I pay attention to audience ratings per minutes ?
just to find out how high the ratings are when I was speaking .
I guess this is also a kind of nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism .
however , after knowing it , I will automatically think about how to raise the ratings higher .
for example , once after a show , I looked at the audience rating by minute and found that , out of the ten points where the view@@ ership exceeded 3 % I had seven .
this was quite fulfilling .
however , during such a process , as I went on , I felt wrong .
my ideas and opinions were getting more and more predictable .
I was appealing to the audience .
however , looking back at what I said , I felt sorry for myself .
in fact , high ratings are easy to get .
we all know that suppose there is a human intelligence pyramid ; there are fewer with a higher IQ and more with lower IQ .
therefore , when you are pursuing the ratings , you will unconsciously win audience from the lower layer .
when your ratings are large enough , it means that now you have more audience from the bottom of the pyramid , where there are many cob@@ bl@@ ers .
this suggest that the idea of &quot; three cob@@ bl@@ ers out@@ wit@@ ting a master mind &quot; is unreliable .
therefore , if we expect to bring together a crowd of people with general intelligence to come up with a genius idea , we are likely to be disappointed .
therefore , I remember being told by my mother as a child that &quot; better work for a wise man than advise a fool . &quot;
what she means is that we will learn much from working for a smart person and come to think in a smarter way .
that is what we call &quot; learn from those who do better . &quot; in Chinese .
however , after you give advice to a slow @-@ wit@@ ted person , on the one hand , he may fail to execute it rightly .
on the other hand , you may have to accommodate to him and you may come to think as he does .
and the other way round , if no three cob@@ bl@@ ers can ever out@@ perform a master@@ mind , then why do we have such a saying ?
so , as I see it , the right question to ask is that under what conditions can the cob@@ bler outw@@ it a master mind ?
I was once asked a question many years ago .
at that time the planned economy has just been replaced by the market economy and the former state @-@ owned vegetable market replaced by today &apos;s farmer markets .
one elder asked , &quot; In the past , before we open the market every day , we received the order from higher authorities of what to sell and how to price &quot;
he said , &quot; Now on the farmer markets , every trader makes his own decision , but why their pricing are still the same ? do they meet together before the market opens and set out a pricing otherwise why does everyone sell at the same price ? &quot;
is this idea understandable ?
it is understandable .
because many of us find it difficult to switch from one mode to another .
what &apos;s more important is that there is actually one thing hidden in his mind .
he thinks that the most reasonable way in our society often comes from self @-@ consciousness .
so today , when we talk about whether three &quot; cob@@ bl@@ ers &quot; can outw@@ it a &quot; master mind , &quot; it does not mean that the decision negotiated by the three would be better than that of the &quot; master mind . &quot;
what we mean is that if each of us makes our own decisions and take action accordingly , we can do something that is impossible for a &quot; master mind &quot; alone .
so let us look back and think about why China has developed so fast in the past 30 years ?
it is an easy question .
it is because we have given the decision of pricing back to the hands of every &quot; cob@@ bler &quot; from the single hand of the &quot; master mind . &quot;
this price is far more reasonable and works better in resource allocation than a price set by a &quot; master mind . &quot;
how to decide the next mechanism of pricing for China ?
the price on our mind is no longer the price of products on the farmer markets , but the price of something that is of greatest significance today , our creation and invention .
we know that many people think that it took the West countries two or three hundred years to achieve what China has achieved in the past 30 years .
naturally , we feel so proud .
under this circumstance of excitement , a very sensible voice stood out .
it said : &quot; it is easy to answer why it only took China 20 or 30 years to achieve what the Western countries have achieved in 2 or 3 hundred years . because when the West Countries were forging ahead , they were opening up a new path so they traveled slowly . but China is moving forward on the road that has been forged by the fore@@ runners , so it was able to go faster . &quot;
so where are we today ?
those who have been forging the new path in front of us are continuing their work .
however , we are not welcomed to follow them .
we are nearly reaching our end .
now it is time we forge a new path along with others rather than take a ready @-@ made road .
in the past when we talk about &quot; learning , &quot; we are actually talking about following suit .
today we find that there is less and less to learn from ; there is less and less others are willing to share with us ; it is becoming harder and harder to learn through technology acquisition .
when we tra@@ verse further down the road , how to decide the next &quot; market price &quot; ?
can we find a way to enable more people to take part in and act together to generate the effect that &quot; 1.3 billion cob@@ bl@@ ers with their wits combined exceed that of Z@@ HU@@ GE Liang , the master@@ mind . &quot;
what we need today is not a master mind who decides for us what to create , what to think about and what to do .
what we need is an environment in which all of us can contribute our wisdom and take ac act so we make something extraordinary happen .
thank you all .
good evening , everyone .
tonight , I want to share with you a story called , &quot; You are an Eff@@ erv@@ escent Tab@@ let . &quot;
at 26 years old , an eff@@ erv@@ escent tablet encountered a major problem that she couldn &apos;t fix , which made her sad and frustrated .
what was her problem ?
that eff@@ erv@@ escent tablet was me .
at the age of 26 , I was diagnosed with dys@@ lex@@ ia .
dys@@ lex@@ ia .
I saw a black cross flashing through my head when I heard I had dys@@ lex@@ ia .
dys@@ lex@@ ia , what is that ?
I remember I was 26 when I got the news .
I was at the tip of a nervous breakdown and all my thinking collapsed .
I was teaching at one of the top international universities in the Netherlands as a cross @-@ cultural lecturer .
in the second year of my tenure , I had to write a thesis and a performance review , but I couldn &apos;t write anything .
because I had difficulties with words , I couldn &apos;t read them , nor could I write them down .
therefore , when I found out that I needed to write another paper in order to get promoted , my mind went blank .
I was frustrated , sad and very nervous because I didn &apos;t know what to do .
it wasn &apos;t because my English or Dutch wasn &apos;t good enough .
it was because I had so much inside that I wanted to express , but I just wasn &apos;t able to write things down .
there was nothing I could do .
so I went to my psychology professor , who is a counselor , and he invited me in telling me to &quot; Take a seat and calm down . &quot;
I entered his counseling room .
he showed me a lot of pictures , I mean a lot of them , and then said , &quot; Con@@ grat@@ ulations , God has opened another door for you . &quot;
okay , the big black cross was still in my head and he said congratulations to me , why ?
after looking through all of those pictures , I figured out that I had dys@@ lex@@ ia .
everyone will ask , what is dys@@ lex@@ ia ?
at that time , I learned that most people have the habit and ability to read from left to right and top to bottom .
that &apos;s how we normally read .
but for people with dys@@ lex@@ ia , what they see are not complete sentences , but scattered words floating around like t@@ ad@@ poles swimming with little tails .
so we have to spend a lot of time putting those pieces together to understand everything we read .
okay , now I get it . it says , &quot; the sun sets down behind the mountain , &quot; not &quot; the mountain sets down behind the sun . &quot;
so the pictures helped me realize why I learnt things at a slower place than the rest of my peers .
because of dys@@ lex@@ ia , I couldn &apos;t do anything .
but I remembered the counselor telling me , &quot; God has opened another door for you . &quot;
another door meant that I needed to face and explore the world , as well as live life in a way different from that of normal people .
so I took all of this information to the dean of my department .
I told him about my difficulties and asked him , &quot; Is there another way to write my thesis and review ?
could I do it with pictures ? &quot;
he replied , &quot; Why not ? &quot;
of course , why not ?
so my papers were done with almost all pictures and barely any words .
it was the first time that a university accepted my paper this way .
I learnt a lot from it .
for the first time , I could get rid of words and all the other &apos; must have &quot; requirements .
I could express my feelings in the way I was most comfortable with , a way that I &apos;m good at .
so I was very happy and deeply relieved .
it also explained why I was different from other kids when I was little .
we all wore the red scarf when we were little , right ?
I remember that my classmates were all good students .
okay , good and excellent students .
good students would wear the red scar@@ ves on the front of their ch@@ ests .
okay .
but for me , I didn &apos;t think that was the only way to wear a red scarf .
I thought that , as long as I have a loving heart , wearing the red scarf anywhere would be fashionable .
so I wore it on my head .
I thought it made me pretty , and I looked different from the others .
because of that , I was seen as a mis@@ chiev@@ ous student to teachers and parents .
yes , indeed .
I couldn &apos;t sit still .
I loved the sense of freedom because my way of reading was different from ordinary people .
so I tried many things I liked , such as catching fish and shrimp , and climbing trees for bird eggs .
I just couldn &apos;t stay put because I loved to move around so much .
because of that , I developed a habit to do things I liked .
my parents tried so hard to control me , to turn me into one of the good students .
so they sent me to calligraphy class .
yeah , to learn calligraphy .
because of my dys@@ lex@@ ia , the characters I wrote down were backwards and different from other children .
I was not a good student .
so they sent me to mathematical Olympi@@ ad class .
they wanted me to calculate complicated math equations .
I didn &apos;t know why , and I saw how my logic was different than other kids , so math was not my thing either .
then my parents told me , &quot; You &apos;re a girl , so let &apos;s try music ! . &quot;
so they sent me to piano class .
I found piano sounded very relaxing and the notes were beautiful .
however , I just couldn &apos;t read the notes on the staff as they were dancing around like a t@@ ad@@ pole . I couldn &apos;t do that either .
my mom told me , &quot; You must pick up a hobby because all of the other students have hobbies . you must have one as well . &quot;
I brain@@ stormed .
look , since I was little , I loved to d@@ oo@@ dle on my textbooks .
I believe I am not the only one who has done that , right ?
I saw a joke online two days ago saying Du Fu , a famous ancient Chinese poet , was very busy .
you may even picture the image in your head .
what &apos;s that ?
those are so @-@ called bad students , drawing what &apos;s in their head .
I loved d@@ ood@@ ling so much .
I d@@ ood@@ led on the wall , on my textbooks , on the floor and everywhere else , even on plates and my clothes .
I thought drawing might be the best way for me .
why ?
because nobody understands what you are drawing .
and you don &apos;t need to draw a complete shape .
there &apos;s no definition about what you need to draw .
I thought drawing suited me because I could draw anything on paper .
so from then on , I have been d@@ ood@@ ling .
unlike other good , normal students , the way I wrote down information was through d@@ ood@@ ling .
my way was different from other people at a young age .
when I was 13 , I was selected by a teacher to continue improving my drawing skills in Beijing .
I studied art because I didn &apos;t feel like a bad student when I was drawing .
I still remember when I was studying abroad at 20 or 21 , I never had a part @-@ time job .
I never had to wait tables at a restaurant or wash dishes . in fact , I feel like I missed out on quite an experience .
I would just paint and draw all throughout the streets .
I received a lot of encouragement and support from people walking by .
I remember I was drawing in front of a very old house .
I was sket@@ ching it .
then , an old man came to me and said , &quot; When you finish , please come to my house . &quot;
I thought , okay , I might have offended him somehow because I didn &apos;t know the customs there .
but I didn &apos;t expect him to say , &quot; I never thought anyone would draw this house . there have been three generations of our family to live in this house . &quot;
he appreciated me so much that he searched through all the cabinets , cup@@ boards and drawers for money , and gave me 700 Danish K@@ ron@@ ers , which was the most money I had ever received before .
so through drawing , I received many unexpected surprises along the way .
I think back and wonder why I was able to express myself artis@@ tically , while the so @-@ called good students weren &apos;t able to be as creative and express whatever was on their mind .
we are bound by so many rules .
for me , had I gone through the conventional educational path in China , I might not have become the person I am today .
but in the end , the most important thing is to open up yourself and make full use of the creativity you are born with .
and the pen is a wonderful tool .
using a pen to draw or d@@ oo@@ dle is actually one of the tru@@ est and most direct ways to express ourselves .
so how many of you think you can &apos;t draw ?
I see most of you have your hands raised .
okay .
another question .
which one did you learn first : how to write or draw ?
how to draw , right ?
your kids d@@ oo@@ dle first , then they are sent to school to learn how to write Chinese characters and have very good handwriting , right ?
okay .
so why not give kids some space to tap into their creativity ?
why not let them play with mud ?
or let them weave something with bamboo ?
does weaving stuff with bamboo stop them from a promising future ?
I remember some people love to make comb@@ s .
okay , so what &apos;s wrong with making comb@@ s ?
carpenter Tan , a company that makes comb@@ s , went listed in Hong Kong , didn &apos;t it ?
everyone is born with creativity .
I was able to tap into my creativity because I did what I do best , and I used a pen to directly express my feelings .
so imagine if all of you take your phone out and take a picture of me .
what will happen ?
we will have 800 photos that look alike , right ?
yes .
but imagine 800 of you holding a very simple pen to d@@ oo@@ dle on a piece of paper .
will there be 800 drawings that look alike ?
no .
why ?
because each one of you is a unique individual , right ?
just like no two leaves in the world are exactly the same .
I just want you to pay attention to your abilities that you may have ignored .
what &apos;s wrong with playing with mud ?
what &apos;s wrong with making comb@@ s ?
it might not promise them a future , but it can help your kids grow and tap into their creativity .
we often imagine at our desks what it would be like to go on a trip in the spring , and how wonderful that will be .
now we &apos;re all working in an office , figuring out how to be innovative .
we can &apos;t always think about innovation in this type of an environment .
give yourself some space , and develop a habit that allows you truly express yourself .
so should we continue to be &apos; good &quot; students trying to figure out what innovation is from the comfort of our desks , or should we dare to pick up a pen , tie a red scarf on our heads and accept ourselves ?
are you willing to step out and try something new and become a lively eff@@ erv@@ escent tablet ?
thank you very much .
this is my third time giving a speech at T@@ n@@ Dao .
my first speech , &quot; The Power of Tran@@ sp@@ arency , &quot; was back in 20@@ 13 and focused on public welfare .
another one was in 20@@ 14 about traveling called , &quot; Life , An Un@@ expected Jour@@ ney . &quot;
now , in 2015 , I &apos;m giving my third speech about business called , &quot; Does Internet Th@@ inking Ex@@ ist in the U.S ? &quot;
I &apos;ve given three talks since T@@ n@@ Dao was launched three years ago .
during those three years , my topics have changed but our world has changed more significantly .
during those three years , the Internet has brought about drastic changes to many industries .
perhaps many entrepreneurs didn &apos;t think too much about it at first , but when later they gradually came to realize its importance , they don &apos;t know how things work with it .
many industries such as retail , finance and manufacturing have been affected by the Internet industry .
so the question is , just like the host mentioned earlier , &quot; Does Internet thinking actually exist in U.S , the birth place of the Internet industry ? &quot;
let me show you a very interesting picture .
as we know , a holiday called &quot; Thanksgiving &quot; is celebrated in the U.S on every fourth Thursday of November .
the next day is called &quot; Black Friday , &quot; which is the day that marks the beginning of America &apos;s major shopping season , the annual shopping season then starts off@@ ci@@ ally .
this picture was shot at midnight on Black Friday in 20@@ 14 .
it shows how Americans shop on that day and vividly reflects the environment .
people started to flood in the moment the doors were opened .
this level of cra@@ z@@ iness and intensity probably reminds us of a similar situation that also happened in China many years ago .
but what is shopping like in China now ?
let &apos;s look at another picture .
this shows the current situation in China .
we don &apos;t have Black Friday in China , but we do have a festival called &quot; Double El@@ even . &quot;
this picture was taken at a sorting station of a logistics company on the second day after Double El@@ even .
on the second day of the shopping festival , you can see a lot of packages , and many were for express delivery .
this discovery is interesting and beg@@ s the question , is the Internet industry in China more advanced than that in the U.S ?
is America today live in a rather primitive business mode while China is in a more advanced business environment ?
many people started to reflect on this interesting question .
in the past one to two years , I have helped many traditional enterprises study internet @-@ oriented transformation .
during this process , people always asked me how things were done in the U.S or whether there were also Internet thinking there .
coincid@@ entally , during the second half of last year , around October , one of the five top recruitment companies , Spencer Stuart , assembled the executives of foreign companies in China and hired an inter@@ ne@@ tization expert from the U.S to conduct a seminar . these companies included Wal@@ mart , St@@ aples who is the office supply retailer , Y@@ um ! brands who is the parent company of K@@ FC , L &apos;@@ Or@@ é@@ al and so on .
of course , this is not called inter@@ ne@@ tization in the U.S .
this word does not exist .
in the U.S. , we call it &quot; digital &quot; and it is digit@@ alization .
an expert was invited and they also wanted a Chinese expert involved , so they asked me to join .
there were three tables there and we gathered together to talk about an interesting topic , the difference between inter@@ ne@@ tization in China and digit@@ alization in the U.S .
we found out that the differences were actually enormous , which was quite a shock to me at the time .
so what are the differences ?
for example , how do people buy things from Wal@@ Mart in the U.S ?
people usually place their orders on Wal@@ Mart &apos;s website .
after they bought their commodities , Wal@@ Mart would thank the customer for shopping , and their purchased goods would be packed and sent to the most accessible store nearby .
that way they can pick them up on their way home .
this would be unbelievable to us in China , right ?
I &apos;ve pass the order online , why don &apos;t you just deliver them to my door@@ step ?
now you are asking me to pick them up in Wal@@ mart myself .
are you serious ?
what &apos;s the situation like in China ?
shipping is free for orders that are more than six yuan in Jiangsu , Zhejiang or Shanghai province .
if you order in the evening , it will be delivered by the next morning .
picking them up in store is just unbelievable .
a friend of mine bought a laptop in the East Coast of the U.S , which had to be shipped from the West Coast .
the shipping cost was almost 3000 yuan .
that &apos;s already half the price of the laptop .
so why such a big difference ?
we found a huge difference between the two countries .
Americans and Chinese could hardly reach a mutual understanding on the subject .
so what &apos;s the biggest difference ?
the logistics are quite different between the two countries .
compared to the U.S , the logistics cost in China is very low .
we believe that e @-@ commerce in China today is still taking advantage of China &apos;s demographic dividend .
in the past , cheap labor forces were in the factories , but now they have gone on the road , working as cou@@ ri@@ ers .
but , can this situation last long ?
probably not .
why ?
because when those hardworking post @-@ 6@@ 0s and post @-@ 7@@ 0s are no longer willing to work as cou@@ ri@@ ers and when those post @-@ 8@@ 0s and post @-@ 9@@ 0s take over the jobs , the cost of labor might increase .
they may not want to work as hard as the cou@@ ri@@ ers today do .
so things will change .
however , for now logistics cost in China is much lower than in the U.S .
so the thing is , if I buy something online for 60 yuan and the shipping costs me 6 yuan , this is acceptable .
however , if I have to pay a 50 yuan shipping fee for a product only worth 60 yuan , I may not buy it online .
I then would only purchase online when the value of the product is over 500 yuan .
so logistics cost is a big difference .
the second difference is also very interesting .
since 1997 , the land price in China has been steadily increasing .
for all of the physical stores today , whether a mall or a supermarket , the rent for land makes up part of their product price .
whether the rent is commission @-@ based or a fixed amount , it will ultimately be included in the product price .
with such a price mark@@ up , you become less competitive with those dealers online who don &apos;t have it .
there is definitely an inevitable price gap between online and physical stores .
some people may argue that the price of the products online is not that low because of the cost of Internet traffic .
everyone , the Internet traffic fluctu@@ ates according to the land price .
so when the traffic costs online is as much as the cost offline , if then the land price offline decreased , will the traffic costs follow the fluctuations of the market ?
we believe that the land price offline leads to a competitive advantage for physical stores , which turns out to be a disadvantage for online stores .
meanwhile , the logistics makes it an advantage for online shops comparing to the physical stores .
when these two add up , you can see that the business environment in China and in the U.S is completely different .
that is why we would see American people rushing into to the stores for shopping while Chinese are shopping online .
so is the situation about to last ?
we think that land prices may not last very long .
we don &apos;t dare try to predict the decline of the land price because it &apos;s hard to conclude .
if it stays the same , with more and more people opening shops online and fewer stores offline , will the rental price drop a bit ?
will this also affect the cost of commercial real estate ?
these fluctuations will reach a new balance in the middle of a dynamic environment .
actually it has already been formed in the United States .
Amazon has opened its physical stores , and many Chinese stores , malls and supermarkets find this encouraging .
they think , &quot; Finally , an American e @-@ commerce company has opened physical stores . &quot;
however , the case is completely different .
this goes back to the question &quot; Does Internet thinking exist in the U.S. ? &quot;
the answer is , yes .
is there an Internet thinking or an internet environment in the U.S ?
does it disrupt the traditional industries ?
of course it does .
but the magnitude of disruption is completely different .
lots of people have asked me this question , &quot; Is there any Internet thinking in Germany ? is the Internet thinking a worldwide phenomenon ? &quot;
we often see articles spreading on the Internet , claiming that there isn &apos;t any internet thinking in Germany .
Germans are only focused on one thing , and that is the product .
today , there are many people in the Internet industry in China who say that they &apos;re now focused and they are looking for the perfection , a good reputation and the efficiency .
I find these qualities worthwhile .
aren &apos;t that the qualities that we should maintain all the time ?
shouldn &apos;t we start to pursue further a long time ago ?
Germans have been doing this for a few decades or a few hundred years earlier .
this is not the so @-@ called Internet thinking , but something that we should have done but ignored in the past few years .
we still need to catch up on this .
an article has gained much popularity recently and it is enti@@ ti@@ led , Ta@@ obao is H@@ in@@ dering China From Bec@@ oming Rich .
I don &apos;t know if you have read it .
its central argument is Ta@@ obao has forced lots of companies into a vicious cycle of price competition , which resulted in poor profits of these companies .
if they can &apos;t make profits , China won &apos;t become rich , leading to another vicious competition cycle .
I strongly oppose this point of view .
so what is my stance ?
previously , I mentioned that China differs greatly from Germany and the U.S in three ways .
besides land price and logistics , another difference is the gap in innovation environment .
today , when we notice a new idea , what we do is study it , then wait and see if it is lucrative .
here &apos;s a basic example .
if someone in Shandong inv@@ ents something , we will wait and see the results .
if it turns out to be a success , what will happen is that im@@ itations will emerge in Guangdong , Jiangsu , Shanxi and Hebei province .
when everybody starts to imitate , the result is that people are making money out of it .
we call this business model &quot; economies of scale . &quot;
it means that every place has its own geographic boundaries so the action of imitation has a natural protection and it can be protected .
so everyone can make some money in the business , then people begin to realize that there is not enough money to make there , then they lower a bit their quality standards and make things more simple and cheap , so they could earn more money .
what is the role of Ta@@ obao here ?
well , T@@ abao has made it extremely easy for us to compare prices today .
the new concept of economies of scope has then@@ replaced economies of scale .
what is economies of scope ?
if I made a new website after the arrival of a new product , I would have the opportunity to sell it all over China without any geographic restrictions .
the geographic protection disappears once the products are sold Nation@@ al@@ wide .
thus the price comparison becomes extremely simple for consumers .
if the products are similar , then the only thing we can compare is price , isn &apos;t it ?
so what &apos;s the effect of Ta@@ obao ?
Ta@@ obao will make people who make money by im@@ itating and copying others enter into an inevitable price cycle and be eliminated eventually by the market .
many people will eventually figure out that the only way to make money is through innovation .
people can only make money by producing unique things to be competitive .
this is the only way to increase profits .
we have seen many companies with many practices and efforts in this regard , but I will not mention their names , or you would say I am advertising for them .
that was the third major difference .
so what &apos;s the fourth one ?
I will show you another very interesting picture of an Internet company in Europe .
its webpage is shown on the left .
more than two @-@ thirds of its webpage is covered by two huge words , &quot; Our mission . &quot;
what &apos;s the mission ?
the translation says , &quot; To become the world &apos;s largest internet platform outside the U.S and China . &quot;
after seeing this I feel sorry for European Internet companies .
their mission only aims to become the biggest internet company outside of the U.S and China .
why is that ?
among the ten biggest Internet companies in the world , six are from the U.S , while the rest are from China .
the so @-@ called G@@ 2 scenario has been formed in the Internet world .
there is no place for the third candidate .
why ?
the fourth biggest difference is the population issue in China .
China still has a huge population base .
what does this lead to ?
take Hong Kong for example .
why doesn &apos;t Hong Kong have any big Internet companies ?
the total population of Hong Kong is only seven million .
if the number of adults is one or two million , even if all of them use your app , you only have one million or two users .
what about mainland China ?
it &apos;s obviously easier to get one or two million users , even for an average app .
if the app is slightly more attractive , it probably would get over ten million users .
for example , We@@ Chat has 600 to 700 million users , that is almost two times of the U.S population .
this could only happen in China or other populated countries .
like I said before , the Internet economy follows the economies of scope .
how can we explain economies of scope ?
you calculate the marginal cost of every person based on the fixed total cost spent .
if the population were huge , the marginal cost would be diluted to an extremely small figure .
that &apos;s why the Internet in China is very different from that in the U.S and in Europe ; the difference between China and European countries is even more evident .
so back to the question : does Internet thinking exist in the United States ?
is there Internet industry in Europe or is there an Internet thinking ?
the Internet was started in the United States .
we recognize that they &apos;re good at being creative , innovative and maintaining healthy business environments , but we also have our advantages .
differences in land price , logistics system , innovation and population have presented China with a great opportunity to catch up and even surpass the United States .
we attempted to surpass Britain and catch up with the U.S through the industrialization age , but we weren &apos;t very successful .
we attempted to do the same when the software industry was booming .
we might have surpassed Britain , but not the U.S either .
however , the situation today is drastically different .
the Internet has given many innov@@ ators and companies in China an amazing chance to form an advanced , brand new business model and a chance to surpass the U.S .
finally , I would like to share a short story with you .
I have a buddy whose name is Zhang m@@ ading .
let &apos;s take a look at exactly what the Internet can do for China ?
he made a small website called , &apos; Anti @-@ cancer Community . &quot;
most people in the internet Industry are trying to find a solution to today &apos;s social problems .
air pollution , water pollution and unsafe food can lead to high cancer rates .
so what can you do ?
besides protecting yourself , you definitely have to find a way to safeguard your money .
you might buy insurance .
is there any other ways besides buying insurance ?
let me take his story as example , what did he do ?
m@@ ading recruited 30,000 members online and asked them to do only one thing ; which was to promise that if anybody among that group had the misfortune of getting cancer , they would donate ten yuan to the patient .
if you promised this , and were unfortunately diagnosed with cancer , then other people would donate that ten yuan to you , but you &apos;d only be entitled to the donation after joining the community for at least a year .
why after a year ?
because some Chinese are very smart and would join the group after being diagnosed with cancer .
so after a year and with all conditions met , if someone really get cancer , they would be required to show the diagnosis to members online .
if there was no objection , everyone would donate 10 yuan directly to his or her account .
what if people don &apos;t donate ?
I would like to ask you , if you were a member , would you donate ?
I think most people would .
first , because you &apos;re showing sympathy , and second because you &apos;re joining a community to be insured .
if someone doesn &apos;t donate , they would not be entitled to the insurance .
so don &apos;t give me your donation , if you do I &apos;m conducting illegal fund @-@ raising .
isn &apos;t that right ?
you could just donate your money to the poor man directly .
so if every one of the 30,000 people donated 10 yuan , it would amount to 300,000 yuan .
please think about it .
if I buy insurance with this money , a salesperson would take more than 30 % in commission .
meanwhile , the operating costs of a major insurance company is high as well , so not all of the insurance would be spent just on you .
what is the loss ratio for insurance in China ?
the data from 2010 may be a shock .
it was 20 % .
this means that , out of the one million yuan collected , only 200,000 yuan will be paid to you .
by 20@@ 14 and 2015 , the ratio is close to roughly 50 % .
according to Chinese Lot@@ tery Law , the pay@@ out ratio cannot be lower than 50 % .
this means that you &apos;re better off buying a lottery ticket rather than insurance .
however , with the previous model , there would be no deductions at all from the 300,000 yuan because all of money would be spent on the person who needs help .
this is the change and power the Internet has brought us .
we are in a great age .
some people may be afraid , while some people see it has an opportunity .
I wish that all of you here could embrace this great age , embrace the Internet and make br@@ ill@@ ant achievements .
thank you everyone .
I &apos;m here to share my thoughts about being a f@@ oo@@ die .
I brought two things .
can you see them ?
okay .
one is a p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate , and the other is a man@@ go .
both of them are delicious , and we all love them .
but we may find a problem while eating them .
take this p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate for an example .
you have to peel it before eating .
if you have enough patience , you &apos;ll put it all into a bowl and use a spoon to eat it , right ?
and in the end , we have to spit the seeds out .
isn &apos;t it troublesome ?
it is known that the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate is especially good for women .
but is there an easier way to eat p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates ?
of course , that &apos;s why I came here . a f@@ oo@@ die from Yunnan with an idea .
you see , when you peel the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate , the best feature is that you won &apos;t get your hands dirty .
this the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate after it &apos;s pe@@ eled .
in Yunnan , we call the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate ghost fruit .
why ghost fruit ?
because it &apos;s nearly impossible not to drop a gran@@ ule while pe@@ eling .
okay , how do you eat it ?
I just pe@@ eled this without any juice leaking .
so how should we eat it ?
it is quite an art to eat it .
people often say , &quot; The most glorious thing is labor , &quot; right ?
it &apos;s tricky when eating a p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate .
but we have a special way to do it .
it &apos;s not like you eat it gran@@ ule by gran@@ ule , but rather you eat like a normal meal .
there &apos;s no seed to spit out because you ate it .
why did I eat it like this ?
I don &apos;t know if you can find this on Baidu bai@@ ke .
it &apos;s difficult for us to eat something from the natural world without worrying , and the thing you eat can release the bad stuff from your body .
I think p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate seeds may have this effect .
so how do you eat man@@ go ?
we have two ways , don &apos;t we ?
as you know , Chinese usually peel the skin and go@@ bble down the fruit , which is really enjoyable .
but this way of eating would make you look like a baby because there will be stuff all over your mouth .
there is a European way of eating man@@ gos that is more gentle .
they cut it open and dice it before eating .
okay .
is there a third way ?
he he he .
the Yunnan eating method .
if you &apos;re lucky enough to go to the Spring Festival G@@ ala this year , you &apos;ll have a chance to witness the magic in 30 seconds .
no matter how you eat man@@ gos , either the Chinese or European way , there &apos;s a bigger problem besides being in@@ elegant when you eat it@@ .It &apos;s the strings inside man@@ gos .
they get stuck between your teeth .
that &apos;s why man@@ go juice is more favorable .
so where does the man@@ go juice come from ?
has it been 30 seconds yet ?
there you go , a man@@ go you can drink , natural man@@ go juice .
sometimes you think it &apos;s fun to see the world as a f@@ oo@@ die .
if you want to solve a problem , try another point of view .
you just might out find that it &apos;s not tricky anymore .
my company is filled with IT programmers and Cap@@ ric@@ or@@ n@@ us .
I guess I chose the wrong industry .
today I will be talking about the Internet from a f@@ oo@@ die &apos;s point of view .
we all come across troubles in our lives , like the previous speakers mentioned .
whether it &apos;s about America , China , or the trust between people , we still have many individual problems , such as the serious problem that we often talk about in the city , traffic .
what was the most painful thing while I learned how to drive a car at the very beginning ?
I don &apos;t know when to break driving up or down a hill or at a traffic light .
however , the stop @-@ and @-@ go traffic situation in Shanghai is also tough for drivers .
while learning how to drive for two or three months , I was thinking about making a patent .
I had an idea . is it possible for a car to have a &apos; follow mode &quot; ?
usually , when there &apos;s a traffic jam , you have to manually control the car to follow the vehicle in front of you .
for new drivers , the &apos; follow mode &quot; would skip this step for you .
if you turn it on , your car would follow the car in front of you automatically .
this is totally possible .
because the sensors in your car will warn you if you are too close to other cars while driving , right ?
then why couldn &apos;t it automatically follow the car in front of you to stay within a safe distance ?
we don &apos;t have to wait for self @-@ driving cars .
I think this &apos; follow mode &quot; would make a big difference .
also , you wouldn &apos;t have to come up with a huge innovation because the sensors are already available .
we just have to create the software .
this is the type of stuff software programmers think about .
after learning how to drive for a while , I came across another problem ; the inside of the car gets too hot when the sun is burning .
I started thinking if there was a way to drop the temperature inside of the car a little ?
I heard there was a solution .
Aud@@ i or Ben@@ z has a function that can turn on your car &apos;s air condition about five minutes in advance , so that it &apos;ll feel cool when you get into the car .
is there any other way ?
I thought that this might be my second contribution to the Internet of Vehicles and ITS at the time .
in fact , I think it &apos;s very simple .
this creation has already taken shape .
what is it ?
it &apos;s the cheap sun shield that can be found in car market , remember ?
you can buy it almost anywhere .
you would find that the car is not too hot when using it , right ?
but the problem is that the car is still hot .
why ?
because the film isn &apos;t strong enough to block all sunlight .
what &apos;s the reason this time ?
it &apos;s because of the sun .
the sun only has two functions .
one is to produce heat , and the other is for light .
if we block the heat and the light , we would feel cooler in the car , right ?
does anyone remember that Stephen Chow movie , &quot; From Beijing with Love &quot; ?
there &apos;s a flashlight in it that can only be turned on by the sunlight .
isn &apos;t it the principle behind the sun shield ?
when there &apos;s sunlight , this film is actually able to drive the fan and cooling system inside the car .
the brighter the sun is , the cooler the car will be .
the system won &apos;t work if there &apos;s not that much sunlight .
I thought my second possible contribution to the car industry was the sun shield , while I was driving for one to two years .
it works hard when the sunlight is strong , and we will feel comfortable after getting into the car .
keep in mind that it &apos;s natural , so it won &apos;t consume your fuel and the fit is adaptable as well .
as a f@@ oo@@ die with no sense of direction who has to drive , I was faced with my third traffic problem , which is about the vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t .
our government is advocating for public transportation , which can save energy and increase efficiency .
many people still don &apos;t prefer it . why is that ?
have you noticed that ?
from my perspective , there are two issues .
first , I feel that it &apos;s not free as I will encounter the situation where I can &apos;t catch a ride .
we have di@@ di now and it &apos;s convenient .
even though it &apos;s controversial , it meets our needs .
then what &apos;s the second problem ?
it &apos;s undeniable that Shanghai has surpassed London to become the largest subway network in the world , and it &apos;s still building more lines .
however , it &apos;s not convenient on both ends .
&apos;@@ Both ends &quot; means leaving the house , getting on the subway , out of the station and finally to my destination .
if convenience on both ends can be solved , I &apos;d love to take public transportation .
how should we fix it ?
I have no idea yet .
I just thought of another point .
if those problems aren &apos;t fixed , we have to drive a car .
since we don &apos;t have a &apos; follow mode &quot; yet , it &apos;s painful during the stop @-@ and @-@ go traffic situation .
plus , I &apos;d like to eat my p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate in the car .
I think there are two ways to fix the problem with the lack of space in Shanghai .
one way is to widen the Yan &apos;an Road and North @-@ South vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ ts , as well as the inner and center rings .
that is clearly impossible because the cost of demolition would be too high .
another way that &apos;s easier is to create a higher space and a deeper underground space .
but it &apos;s hard to dig a space underground , isn &apos;t it ?
how should we build a higher space ?
should we build another layer of the vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t on Yan &apos;an Road ?
does anyone know what cars look like before they leave the factory ?
has anyone been in this business or seen it ?
before the cars are taken out of the factory , they &apos;re like a cable car .
there &apos;s a cable hanging the cars to move them , and the car parts are connected piece by piece .
the process is slow , but the overall efficiency is excellent .
what if there &apos;s a ramp that allows your car to be hung on a cable on your way from home to the central ring .
you could even stop the engine .
why ?
because you chose the Cao He@@ jin exit , what should you do then ?
a f@@ oo@@ die can happily eat their p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates and man@@ gos , right ?
or maybe you can read a newspaper , right ?
even call your friends on the phone or w@@ ech@@ at them online .
in short , first , you wouldn &apos;t need to drive .
second , you wouldn &apos;t get hit because your driving skills are not important anymore at the moment .
third , it &apos;s energy saving .
what &apos;s more , it &apos;s faster .
all we need to do is to just sit in the car and wait until we reach our destination .
plus there would be a road leading you so that you can continue driving after the Cao He@@ jin exit .
I wonder if the mayor would invite me to be the traffic consultant after hearing this ?
these are three things that a man with no sense of direction or driving ability thought about driving .
you see , when we experience problems in our lives , many of us would complain and think they &apos;re tough to handle .
but after joyful contemplation , you would have a feeling of &apos; why not &quot; because the things that you thought were impossible , now seem possible .
Internet thinking is rather popular now , and there are many different explanations .
from my perspective , the easiest one is to ask yourself , &apos; why not &quot; whenever you come across problems , especially when you &apos;re thinking about saying &apos; no . &quot;
whenever you have an odd experience , instead of saying no , you should think , &apos; why not ? &quot;
this may be the Internet thinking I understand .
I think when facing a new challenge , we should tolerate it .
I mentioned before that our fixed thinking might gain the upper hand when we experience something we &apos;re accustomed to because we take it for granted .
in fact , it would be harder to deny ourselves because of our habits .
but even at that moment , we should think &apos; why not ? &quot;
who knows , it could be fun .
take a look at the pictures .
does one of them look very familiar to you ?
Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ iang is giving a speech in D@@ avo@@ s , but I didn &apos;t go because I &apos;m here participating in the T@@ n@@ Dao forum .
I &apos;m fortunate enough to have participated several times , but you &apos;ll find something very interesting .
instead of the top 500 companies being in attendance , they &apos;re actually within the top 100 .
when you &apos;re regarded as a lesser @-@ known person by many of the elite , they &apos;ll ask you , &quot; What do you think China , America , and the world will be like in the next ten years ? &quot;
they &apos;ll ask an American , a Chinese who is wearing tang@@ z@@ huang or someone from Africa .
while seeing these big@@ w@@ igs are listening to the words of nobody , I &apos;m wondering if they &apos;re thinking the same thing .
are they thinking about how to break their fixed thinking method as well ?
people who were born after 1980s and 1990s are thought to be unfortunate because we missed out on the opportunity of real estate speculation .
I wonder if we can grab the opportunity to snatch up investment .
as the previous speakers mentioned , we are in a great time because we can make our ideas and dreams come true .
just like eating this p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate , no one can stop you .
if you &apos;re innovative , you might be able to stand here and share it with everyone .
that &apos;s the freedom and the spirit of the Internet .
I wonder if there will be a &apos; D@@ avo@@ s of China &quot; or other Chinese forums like that some day .
President Xi and Premier Li would also listen to what people born after 1990s , even born after 1995 , are talking about .
they would realize that these young people used to say &apos; no &apos; , but now they prefer to say , &apos; why not ? &quot;
okay , Thank you all .
I guess many of us here today are Apple fans .
so am I myself .
its logo , every time I see it , will remind me of the core values of the founder , that is to believe in the simple , to be dedicated and to per@@ sue excellence , as well as its commitment to change the world .
actually I find there is another company that goes even further than Apple in pursuing excellence and who is better at it .
only that , instead of cell phones , it makes cameras .
I happen to have one of their products here in my hand to share with you .
it is a very simple camera , even without an automatic focus .
you have to use your hands .
and you can only take black @-@ and @-@ white photos with it .
it is a very classic design though .
for over sixty years , its appearance has never changed , yet today it &apos;s the most expensive camera on the market .
unbelievable , right ?
it even doesn &apos;t have a logo .
does anyone here know what company I am talking about ?
wow !
Le@@ ica !
I guess many people have heard of Le@@ ica .
the n@@ ou@@ ve@@ au ric@@ he just love Le@@ ica cameras .
they buy them even though they have no idea how to use it , because they are totally intrigu@@ ed by the logo .
but this one doesn &apos;t have a Le@@ ica logo .
that &apos;s the company is really canny .
why do I say that ?
not wanting its brand to be tar@@ n@@ ished by the n@@ ou@@ ve@@ au ric@@ he , Le@@ ica removed its logo from its highest @-@ priced top @-@ shelf cameras .
so the n@@ ou@@ ve@@ au ric@@ he could only buy the second @-@ rate Le@@ ica cameras .
as we all know , those who really appreciate the value of Le@@ ica cameras are more interested in the cameras themselves , rather than the Le@@ ica logo printed on them .
don &apos;t you agree ?
the top @-@ tier photographers in the world , most of them use cameras from Le@@ ica , which is a very interesting thing .
let &apos;s imagine , if BMW or Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z removed their logo from their cars , how many people would still buy them ?
how many people would still buy a iPhone if the logo of Apple were removed ?
Le@@ ica is a company that even out@@ does Apple in ensuring high quality .
so how good are its cameras ?
take one thing for example .
Le@@ ica lens produced in the 1930s can still help shoot top @-@ quality photos today .
but the quality of Le@@ ica &apos;s products is so good that this back@@ fires on Le@@ ica , for with one Le@@ ica camera at hand , you may never have to buy another camera in your lifetime .
if someday in future , iPhone could also achieve such superb quality then we will need no other cell phones for a life time if we ever have one iPhone .
in that case , the market share of Apple would be sure to shrink and Apple will kill itself in time .
therefore , Le@@ ica finds itself stuck in a similar dilemma .
but it is reluctant to expand its market at the cost of quality .
both Apple and Le@@ ica have their faith .
they stick to values they hold dear .
apple seems to be calling out to us , &quot; Pur@@ sue excellence and change the world . &quot;
while Le@@ ica &apos;s voice is , &quot; Pur@@ sue excellence . no matter how big this world is , I will guard my own world . &quot;
I am an angel investor .
most of the projects I invest in are star@@ tu@@ ps , usually led by one person , sticking to one single idea and faith .
I talked a lot about Le@@ ica and Apple , because I believe the values of the founder will eventually be the motive power of the company &apos;s long @-@ term development and growth .
so when I talk with entrepreneurs about their projects , I rarely care about how much money they can make .
nor do I bother much about the specific figures or details .
the founders &apos; values are my top concern .
what imp@@ els them onto the path of entrepreneurship ?
that &apos;s a very important question for me , for angel investment in my eyes is more like seeking out the values I sympath@@ ize with than just investing money in an idea .
here I &apos;d like to share with you some projects i@@ Start Vent@@ ures L@@ LC has engaged in .
the first is Hun@@ ter@@ On , a recruitment site focusing on head@@ hunting services .
it has recently received an investment of 20 million dollars from Sequ@@ o@@ ia .
its founder is a young woman who studied law in university .
but she didn &apos;t like being confined in the office with all the paperwork , so when she graduated she decided not to seek jobs in law firms .
that made her job hunting a lot harder .
she had to drag herself to one job interview after another .
then one day she received a phone call and it said , &quot; You are hired . &quot;
the next day she went to work and found that it was a head@@ hunting company .
given that she had zero experience in human resources , she had to start from scratch .
with hard work , she became the best performer in the company from an intern in one year .
then she decided to start her own business .
when I was listening to her story , I believed her company was worth my investment , because I saw in the founder a spirit of always striving to be the best .
what happened later proved I was right .
although I had faith in this female entrepreneur , the problem was that her business area was traditional head@@ hunting .
though her real interest was starting an Internet company , no one in her team had any experience or technical backgrounds in this field .
one day , she came to me and said she had shut down her head@@ hunting company .
that really took me by surprise , after all , its annual sales turnover was hitting tens of millions yuan so I asked why .
she said , &quot; With this head@@ hunting business hold me back , I can &apos;t dedicate all my energy to the Internet business . &quot;
thus she threw herself wholeheartedly into her website .
about last September she came to me quite excited and told me that her website was beginning to make money .
that September she earned thirty to forty thousand yuan .
then came a profitable October and profits were increasing by month starting from November and December .
so what does it mean when an Internet company begins to make money ?
it means its business model is established .
so before the end of last year , I asked her how much money she was expecting for the next year .
she said , &quot; Six@@ ty million . &quot;
I asked her the reason .
she said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . this number just came to my mind . &quot;
on Christmas Day , I was sitting around at home and this number &apos; sixty million &apos; kept haun@@ ting me .
suddenly it occurred to me that , if her company could earn one million in January , two million in February , three million in March , and if things could go on just like that , then there would be over fifty million for the whole year , a number quite close to her target of &quot; sixty million . &quot;
so I immediately contacted her on We@@ Chat .
after the New Year , her company began to arrange all its products , sales activities and services around this very blueprint .
sure enough , in January it made one million , and in February two million .
when in the middle of March I accompanied some leaders of our district on a visit to her company , its sales that month had surpassed two million .
finally the sales of her company this year has far exceeded sixty million .
this woman received my investment at last .
y reason for the investment was very simple : I believed she was going to be the best .
I@@ start Vent@@ ures L@@ LC has participated in projects of all sorts led by different kinds of entrepreneurs .
there is a very excellent food delivery team named &quot; Me@@ ish@@ is@@ ong . &quot;
its three founders all used to work as senior executives in the Fortune 500 companies .
but what are they doing now ?
they are sl@@ aving away in food delivery .
when I first met the team , they were , more than ten people in all , cr@@ amming together in a mixed @-@ use apartment .
but by the end of this year , their food delivery team will employ more than 12@@ 00 riders .
that number will further increased to five or six thousand this time next year .
this is not an ordinary food delivery team .
traditionally , the take@@ out food is delivered by young men from rural areas who want to find an interim job in the city .
when a customer orders take@@ out , the restaurant will call the rider , who will then rush from where he is stationed to fetch the take@@ out .
after he has delivered the take@@ out , he will then come back to the designated place and wait for more orders .
the whole process is linear .
but Me@@ ish@@ is@@ ong &apos;s team members have a lot of useful experience for they have worked in the delivery system of Wal@@ mart and Apple .
I remember at first I just couldn &apos;t understand why they quit their senior executive jobs and chose to deliver food .
they told me that before they started their food delivery business , they had spent months analyzing what business they should focus on .
eleven choices were short@@ listed , but they ve@@ to@@ ed them one by one .
they had their own standards : first , the business wouldn &apos;t need a large initial investment ; second , big companies wouldn &apos;t push themselves in .
food delivery was the only choice left .
but their delivery is different from others &apos; .
they extract the best stuff from their former employers &apos; delivery system and ideas , and then integrated it in their own delivery system .
their riders are dynamic and placed in a matrix .
those riders waste no time in waiting but always have something to fetch and deliver .
traditional riders can deliver 20 orders at most a day , but Me@@ ish@@ is@@ ong &apos;s riders can complete 80 .
this team , at core , is absolutely a mobile internet data company which makes the best of geographic locations .
it marks a revolution in food delivery .
handsome guys could do star@@ tu@@ ps .
when high @-@ end technologies are combined with s@@ cut work , the world just become sexy .
this year I also invested on a technical team from Yan &apos;an , a sacred place for Chinese revolution
do you believe such a place could have world @-@ level top technologies ?
Le me tell you , it indeed can .
this unusual team is made up of a father and a son .
they returned from the US and started their own business eight years ago and finally they developed a biological technology that could help oil wells increase production .
but we all know that in China the oil sector is highly monopol@@ ized .
I remember when I first met the team I was really moved by the efforts they made to develop such a technology in order to serve their motherland .
my second reaction was feeling really sorry for them , for their star @-@ up business in such a monopol@@ ized market and society was sure to lose .
the father and the son went from the Da@@ qing oil field to the Shen@@ gl@@ i oil field , then to the Northeast oil field and the Kar@@ am@@ ay oil field , yet nobody invested .
but I decided to invest at last .
after I invested , we discussed how we could survive and develop .
during the process it suddenly occurred to us that in the US , oil wells are not monopol@@ ized by the government .
it is a free market where everyone can buy or poc@@ ess oil wells .
so we said , &quot; Let &apos;s go to the US and try our luck . &quot;
the team soon brought their technology to the US , signed contracts and launched pilot projects there .
that made me both glad and sad .
I &apos;m glad because after eight years of entrepreneurship , they could finally promote their technology on the market .
I &apos;m sad because the technology developed in Yan &apos;an , the birthplace of the Chinese revolution , was now helping Americans make money instead of serving our own country .
but we believe this team from Yan &apos;an is just experiencing a strategic transition .
this is just like the &quot; eight years of resist@@ ence , &quot; they will be back !
next I &apos;ll talk about another project .
it hasn &apos;t even got a name .
and it is now being led by one person sticking to one idea and one faith .
this person resol@@ ves to do something great , a grand career , for he is going to up@@ end the business model of Baidu and Google .
but he is in this alone , with one faith .
do you think it is possible ?
of course !
will he succeed ?
so far he is the only member in his team .
no one has faith in him .
no one joins him .
and no one supports him .
so what exactly is his business model ?
he vows to develop a new @-@ generation search engine , which regards its users as partners .
in the new business model , users are cooperating with the search engine , they use the service it provides and bring corresponding values with commercials , in the end they will share the profits .
the more you use the search engine , the more money you can get from it .
it will be a win @-@ win business model .
this person is still fighting his battle alone .
no one is joining him .
nor does anyone give him money .
but he never gives up fighting .
he must convince the world so what confron@@ ts him now is the entire world .
if any of you happens to sympath@@ ize with his values , then I think you really should join him now .
thank you !
before coming on to the stage , I have been wondering , what are the changes that the Internet has brought us ?
when I first went on the Internet about 20 years ago , the biggest problem that bothered me was the speed of Internet .
for a 14.@@ 4@@ k modem , it took me a couple of minutes just connect to the Internet , and almost half an hour just to download a 100@@ k document .
why was that happening ?
besides the limitation of bandwidth , our way of downloading was slowing us down .
everything from everywhere was taken off from the central server .
tens of thousands of computers were trying to download one document from a single source , which seemed to create congestion .
at the time , there were some advanced technical thinkers contempl@@ ating , can this way of downloading be changed ?
then someone proposed that , after each computer finished downloading a document , their status should be different .
it &apos;s no longer just an end receiver of information .
instead , it can be a provider for others to download .
so , our way of downloading transformed from a centralized one to a disseminated approach .
the status of each personal computer on the Internet converted from a single receiver of information to a bilateral pass point of information .
the stat@@ uses are more equal now and the dispersion of information is no longer through a centralized server .
before , we usually watched CCTV or read People &apos;s Daily for news .
now we have We@@ Media so that for each end @-@ user , information is not just received , but also sent out .
therefore , we don &apos;t give such values as freedom , equality and sharing , to the Internet .
instead , they are brought by the nature the technology , freedom , equality , sharing and transparency .
as we change the way of downloading with limited bandwidth by using software like em@@ ule , we increase the speed of bandwidth and improve the efficiency .
Air@@ b@@ n@@ b changed the way I travel .
in the past when choosing a hotel for our trip we would repeatedly compare the prices .
after the birth of this company , we were able to connect globally with all the homeowners with vacant homes as they posted pictures on the Internet for the public to see and to share .
after selecting a place , you &apos;re able to make a payment online so that when you finally arrive , you can simply walk in and begin your stay .
you are no longer constrained by the ways of traveling .
we can even find those secret little houses hidden by the snow , or those stylish tree houses .
for homeowners , they write a review based on whether the tenant made the payment on time and whether the facilities in the house were taken care of without any damage .
tenants who have great reviews will be welcomed by homeowners all over the world , or rejected if they don &apos;t .
similarly , tenants can also write comments based on the authenticity of the posted pictures ; whether the description online matches the real condition of the house and the quality of the service , and whether the pictures online were fabricated or phot@@ os@@ hop@@ ped .
once this two @-@ way communication is formed , it radically and fundamentally changes our way of traveling .
with just this one app , all that work can be done conveniently , and the service is provided in 192 countries .
so it &apos;s easy to imagine how the Internet has made sharing between people much more convenient .
there is another very interesting company , Z@@ ip@@ car .
a group of environment@@ alist in Europe and the US wondered , does every single family need to have their own vehicle ?
after some research , the utilization rate of privately owned cars is 8 % , which means that cars go unused for more than 90 % of the time .
it occu@@ red to someone that we could gather all private vehicles in a neighborhood to a public parking lot .
when we need to use a car , we can simply go online , see what vehicles are available and chose one .
we can directly get the keys from the parking lot and drive away .
once we finished , we can return the car back to the parking lot , clean and with a full tank of gas .
with that idea in place , the utilization rate of privately owned cars can significantly improve from 8 % to 50 % .
maybe two out of ten families no longer need to buy their own cars , which would help them save money and resources .
in China , a company called i@@ Car@@ s@@ club was founded by a Chinese student in Singapore .
the headquarters is located in Singapore , and they &apos;re also implementing a similar strategy to share vehicles .
all of these experiences of sharing things , whether houses or vehicles , are happening between strangers .
in the early stages of education , Chinese have all been taught a story called , &quot; Kon@@ gr@@ ong Sha@@ res Pe@@ ar . &quot; so , from a very young age , we learn that sharing always happens between our closest family members and friends .
but the birth of the Internet has changed that concept , making it easy for strangers to share things .
the companies you see here in this picture , L@@ end@@ ing@@ Club , Z@@ ip@@ car , Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , i@@ Car@@ s@@ club , and Zhi@@ hu , are all platforms where strangers share knowledge with each other .
take L@@ end@@ ing@@ Club for example , it completely transformed the ecology of finance .
banks were the only institutions we could borrow money from in the past , and many documents need to be submitted for a month @-@ long review .
finally , at the end of the month , they always tell you , &quot; Sorry , we can &apos;t lend to you . &quot;
with P@@ 2@@ P , that is , peer to peer loans , we can form a legitimate loan relationship between strangers .
we no longer need to go to banks for their inefficient financial services .
banks have taken advant@@ aged of information asym@@ metry to make large profits off of interest .
a depos@@ itor takes a current interest lower than one percent , and the borrower pays up to 8 % , or even as high as 12 % , in costs for a loan .
with P@@ 2@@ P , strangers can directly match idle finance resources , which enormously enhances how efficiently resources can be real@@ located to others .
in an industrialized society , to overcome the ini@@ ffici@@ ency in information , capital and material flow , we gather all resources together .
we gather the resources of banks , host@@ els and five @-@ star hotels and re@@ distribute them to solve the inconvenience .
but now with the help of P@@ 2@@ P and the Internet , strangers can easily share their own idle resources with each other .
the picture at the top right corner is not very clear ; it &apos;s E@@ ac@@ ed@@ ai@@ jia .
if we drink a lot in Shanghai , we can open this app in our phone at any time to find a designated driver nearby to help us get home .
I can even look at their profile photos , and pick the one that is the most pleasing to my eyes .
this is resource sharing between strangers at its finest .
with so many business models using the peer @-@ to @-@ peer , multi@@ point @-@ to @-@ multi@@ point , direct allocation of resources , we are seeing a surge in the number of venture capital projects .
we have been calling the whole world a global village , but in reality , although culture and civilization keeps progressing , even your next @-@ door neighbor can sometimes become your enemy .
or in the worst case , families can become strangers .
but with the Internet , we have established a new credit system , which could only be done with your closest family members before , but now is quite easily done with a third @-@ party platform .
for instance Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , the platform itself has this third @-@ party credit system where strangers can share with each other .
L@@ end@@ ing@@ Club is the same .
it allows strangers to make financial transactions , but some very professional groundwork still needs to be done , such as pre @-@ loan investigations , in @-@ loan management and after @-@ loan collection .
if there are any issues that occur with the borrowers throughout the term of the loan , it will be reported to the lender .
therefore , the credit assessment system is the life@@ blood of this whole lending process .
we can also see some other new trends , including a new P@@ 2@@ P business model .
like when I need to buy groceries , I could post my shopping list online .
there are other working professionals who get off work that could help me get the things on the list because we live in the same neighborhood .
in return , I would pay them a fee , which is a practical of sharing idle time .
building the foundation of trust amongst strangers through the strength of technology is one of the most basic principles of sharing between strangers .
we also know that a person leaves a lot of footprints and tracks on the Internet .
eBay is used overseas , while in China we mostly shop on Ta@@ obao .
the credit of buyers and sellers are carefully evaluated by the third @-@ party credit assessment system that facilitates the success of direct transactions .
the enormous success of Ta@@ obao largely depends on this system .
so does Air@@ b@@ n@@ b .
T@@ ask@@ rabbit is a platform that gives unemployed people a chance to work .
for instance , some laid @-@ off workers might notice that their female neighbor has no idea how to install a light bulb .
just by helping , they can receive a couple of dollars in compensation .
people &apos;s tracks are all accurately recorded through this method on the Internet .
hmm , there is a similar company in China called , &apos; Tu@@ jia . &quot;
all the transaction records that an Internet user has will be filed in this credit system , which will serve as a backup file for any future needs , including financial services .
if you often visit porn sites on the Internet , your status in the credit system can be affected .
there &apos;s no telling if it that means credit rise or fall , but it will be affected for sure .
if you always use U@@ me@@ trip , a travel @-@ based mobile service , and the system notices you travelled to Macao four times within a month , then you might not be the best candidate to have your loans approved ; as you are deemed a risk .
so everybody on the Internet is almost completely transparent .
your every move is accurately recorded , which will be taken into consideration for all of your future transactions .
I like the company a lot because it &apos;s a public welfare P@@ 2@@ P company .
the founder is from a wealthy family in the US .
let &apos;s see what this rich American guy is doing ?
he pulled all of the money from rich Americans together , and then real@@ located it to third world countries like Tanzania , Kenya and Bangladesh .
there are many middle @-@ aged village women who may only need $ 100 or $ 200 to buy seeds of grain or some sheep to improve their living standards .
the other thing they need is to put a lock on their doors to have a higher sense of security .
these types of micro@@ finance cases have been seen as headaches around the world .
unfortunately , not one single traditional finance institution is able to provide an effective solution .
but with the P@@ 2@@ P method of sharing between strangers , the money that would be donated before could now be lo@@ aned out to an equal borrower instead of a charity .
even though the money that is lo@@ aned needs to be repaid , there isn &apos;t any interest .
so the borrower will not feel as stressed , and the communication between both parties will be smoo@@ ther .
this type of system has helped people from over 200 counties around the world .
this company has lo@@ aned out over $ 300 million so far .
we can see that the relationship between people has become so much closer with the assistance of Internet , and the awk@@ wardness is now gone .
these are the photos of people that they have helped in the past .
it is very difficult for these people to receive financial services using traditional financing institutions , but with this type of face @-@ to @-@ face communication and the help of the Internet , resource allocation has undergone a fundamental change .
so , sharing with strangers can help us improve our environmentally , enhance efficiency , and change our lives .
at the same time , we can turn sharing into a trend , and try our best to make it a part of everyone &apos;s lifestyle .
thank you !
frankly speaking , quite a few people know me .
many friends asked me after they met me : &quot; what are you busy with recently , Hua ? you don &apos;t organize events , you don &apos;t treat us meals , and you don &apos;t take exercise to keep fit . what are you up to ? &quot;
I thought for a minute , I have been really busy for the past two or three years .
but the most meaningful thing I did , I think , was being a farmer .
I am the son of a farmer and grew up in the countryside .
but when I was two years old , I moved to Shanghai city as my parents joined the army , and I have grown up in Shanghai ever since .
but in my blood , there is still a farmer &apos;s gene .
therefore , everyday in my spare time , I will imagine my retired life in countryside as described in a poem &quot; From the eastern hedge , I pluck chrysanthem@@ um flowers , And idly look towards the southern hills .. &quot;
I thought there weren &apos;t many people like me .
but later , after being engaged in agriculture , I realized that a lot of people had this idea in mind .
who are these people ?
after 2010 , it was heard that a person , Ding Lei , in the Internet industry went to raise pigs .
everybody was wondering that why he chose to feed pigs since he was doing so well at Ne@@ tease ?
it was definitely a new tendency and represented an industrial trend .
so I believe and I &apos;m sure today that many of you will listen to the Internet icons very carefully .
every word spoken and every action done by these giants may be predicted as the future development direction of the industry .
four or five years have passed and nobody have ever tasted the pork produced by Ding Lei .
however , many from the information technology field have flung them@@ s@@ evels into the agriculture sector .
indeed , I met many of them later , and I asked them : &quot; are you fooled by Ding Lei &apos;s sweet talk ? &quot;
&quot; a little bit , &quot; they told me later .
but as a matter of fact , the main reason is that they can &apos;t get on in the Internet and information technology sectors .
it was not like today when the mobile Internet has started a new round of waves and the Internet thinking is transforming the great traditional industry .
back then , a large group of people in the IT field was rather desperate .
at this time , it occurred to them that agriculture may be a viable option , so many people moved into it .
I asked a lot of people later , in fact , most people engaged in the agricultural sector have read a book , which I also strongly recommend you to read .
it is called Be A F@@ ool At Least Once In Your Life .
the movie Mir@@ acle Ap@@ ples was actually made out of this book .
it is said that people who read this book will cry .
I also read it and I want to cry as well , because this book is so touching .
the book tells that a Japanese farmer , who grew apples , always believed that apples should not be fertili@@ zed and weeds should not removed , because his wife was allergic to pesticides .
it took ten years for his apple tree to have seven flowers and two apples .
her daughter wrote this while doing her homework : &quot; my father is a farmer . he grows apples , but I have never eaten one of his apples since I grew up . it will be the same ten years later . but he still has faith in his apples . apple is the main character and he is the supporting character . he long@@ s for the apples to flourish , so he doesn &apos;t fertili@@ ze , he doesn &apos;t bug , he just lets the apple grow freely .
twenty years later , the apple he grew became very popular .
his name was Kim@@ ura .
at markets in Tokyo now , if you want to make salad from his apples , you have to wait a year .
because his apples are very delicious , which have been planted in the most natural way .
so a lot of people in the IT sector say : I can do this , or I can do the same .
in fact , many people I meet , who have shifted from IT into agriculture sector , are sort of ide@@ alistic .
so today , if we come across a fresh term called &quot; new agricultural workers , &quot; I hope we can pay our respects to them .
I found it really interesting to meet these new agricultural workers .
they do agriculture following the natural rules .
they grow rice in the same way as no insec@@ tici@@ de nor fertilization , only watering plants by rain .
this practice is nat@@ ual farming .
how many seeds can such an acre yield ?
and how much rice can be produced ?
150 to 200 kilograms .
and this appor@@ ach is organic agriculture .
I didn &apos;t realize this when I started to do business in agriculture .
I thought agriculture looked promising .
then I worked in agriculture for more than a year before I draw two conclusions .
the first conclusion was that agriculture was not profitable .
what did I do in agriculture ?
I was thinking of raising chicken .
I char@@ tered a valley of Jiang@@ shan Mountain in Qu@@ zhou of Zhejiang Province to raise chicken .
at that time I wanted to eat fresh eggs .
we raised 300 chickens and we wanted to raise them in the most natural way .
if the chicken were fed in a natural approach , they can lay an egg in three days .
but they ate fo@@ d@@ der worth 40 f@@ en a day , which were all corn feed , bec@@ ase we didn &apos;t feed them genetically modified fo@@ d@@ der .
so as you can see , chicken laid an egg in three days , but they would eat fo@@ d@@ der worth 1 yuan and 20 f@@ en .
plus other expenses , 1 yuan and 50 f@@ en was the normal cost .
we sold them to the channel for two yuan and they wanted another 50 f@@ en for profit .
if we raise 3,000 chicken , which lay an egg in three day , that brings a total of 1,000 eggs .
if you only make fifty f@@ en on an egg , you will make 500 yuan a day and 15,000 yuan a month .
as an ordinary IT engineer , it is normal to have a monthly income of 15,000 yuan .
but this is actually an ideal situation , because usually no one would buy our eggs .
in fact , all the people that are engaged in agriculture , including the new agricultural workers I was just talking about , have encountered this problem .
they produce things the way we just said , but nobody buys them because they &apos;re too expensive .
the second conclusion was nobody believes him .
he said : &quot; the eggs are produced in this way , and the rice is planted in this way . &quot;
is there any difference when you taste them at the table ?
yes , there is .
is there much of a difference ?
no , there isn &apos;t .
how much is the rice which was planted in the most natural approach we just talked about ?
take a guess .
you guess right !
15 yuan for 500 grams .
15 yuan for 500 grams .
I am sure most people will just take a look rather than buying it .
I bought it , and in deed , it tasted special , but I really didn &apos;t know what the difference was .
I want to tell you that agriculture is an industry that demands conscienti@@ ousness .
so what am I trying to say ?
we &apos;ve done a lot of conscientious farming business , we &apos;ve said that many ide@@ alists still persist in agriculture , and we &apos;ve produced goods of high quality .
but due to the reasons of sales and trust , we can &apos;t sell products .
while I was selling eggs , I met my later partners and joined their organization , a non @-@ profit organization called Scar@@ ab , which was established to solve this problem .
so how do they solve this trust issue ?
they have set up a Particip@@ atory Guarantee System , called Consumer Participation , because all P@@ GS requires the participation of consumers .
they didn &apos;t actually invent it , they brought it in from abroad .
for people involved in small @-@ scale agricultural business , they don &apos;t have money to conduct a third @-@ party certification .
as you know , it costs 60,000 yuan to get an organic certification in China .
they maybe can &apos;t afford it , so they have to do something similar .
what is Consumer Participation ?
you are both a consumer and a participant .
in the process of consumption , you also participate in the whole process of production .
many people may doubt that is there anyone like that ?
it seems that some people have nothing to do when they are full and idle .
not really .
as part of the events we held at Scar@@ ab , we char@@ tered several farms and recruited volunteers .
we found that a large number of people in this society were willing to participate in the whole process of food production and verification .
there are only a few things about P@@ GS if we make it plain .
first of all , producer commitment .
the process of production , the amount of possible output and all the raw materials are all clearly listed .
secondly , field investigation and supervision of consumers .
when producers list everything , it means that consumers can pay field visits 24 hours a day without any prior notice .
thirdly , the neighbourhood administrative system .
interestingly , you will notice that when problems arise , they are legi@@ on .
in other words , we cluster all these small farms in the neighborhood together , and if there &apos;s a problem in one , there &apos;s a problem in all of them .
in two years time , Scar@@ ab has invited more than 1,000 volunteers to various outlets and farms around Shanghai city , to collect data and information .
they have collected information on soil , water and the production process .
it &apos;s very inefficient to photograph and sample them .
what can I do for them ?
we are the so @-@ called Inter@@ n@@ ert industry in@@ siders , with the so @-@ called Internet thinking .
so I said : &quot; isn &apos;t it a problem that can be solved by inform@@ atization ? &quot;
what we can do after my engagement is replacing mass participation with inform@@ atization .
and people may wonder : &quot; isn &apos;t it a Ta@@ obao in the food industry ? &quot;
isn &apos;t establishing credit relationships what you do ?
yes , but I think it represents a more profound idea , with the involvement of customers .
we often complain in our daily lives , about bad air and water , about widespread corruption , about private use of government vehicles .
we complain about almost everything .
but you may find it difficult to change these things , why ?
it &apos;s hard for you , as a single individual , to change things .
you can &apos;t change much because you are doing this alone .
why should we be involved ?
I think this is the spirit of the Internet , which asks all the people to participate , so that the value of the Internet will become greater .
today , the Internet has expanded to cover almost all the mainstream population , and the mobile Internet has made it accessible for 60 % or 70 % of the population .
so a large number of people can get involved .
today , if everyone of us can make changes through the Internet every day , a lot of things will be different .
as a matter of fact , this mode has already prevailed abroad , and they called it good@@ ware .
we have heard of hardware , software .
and there is good@@ ware .
that is to say , a little bit kindness of each person is integrated through the Internet .
does China have good@@ ware ?
it &apos;s been around for a long time .
cracking down on human trafficking through Wei@@ bo is a perfect example of good@@ ware .
it &apos;s hard to fight against human trafficking on we@@ i@@ bo .
you can see it happening everywhere , but to be honest , there &apos;s not much one can do about it .
what can you do ?
there are very few things you can do , and taking a picture is all that you can do .
you can call the police , but later you &apos;ll find you don &apos;t have the energy and strength .
but if 10 people , 100 people , 1,000 people , 100,000 people , or even 10 million people do it , it will make a huge difference .
taking the fight against human trafficking through Wei@@ bo as a landmark , I think a full tide of transforming the society through Internet has been flown in China .
today , we can think of many things that can be transformed through Internet .
for instance , why today &apos;s speech is head@@ lined &quot; A World Without T@@ hi@@ eves &quot; ?
when we were preparing for this topic , it struck to me that we all feel so bad about something being stolen .
but everybody encounters the same situation , which is when we reported the case to the police station , police officers usually don &apos;t investigate it , bec@@ au@@ ce the case is not serious .
maybe the case will end with a receipt from the police .
you feel weak .
so what do we want to do today ?
we want to create a software and a platform , which is very easy for IT professionals , but it requires the participation of everyone .
in other words , after you report your case today , you take a picture of your case document , cross out your key and personal information , and then upload it to the Internet .
we &apos;re not here to keep track of what have been stolen .
what information are we focusing on ?
we pay attention to how many cases have taken place in this area .
we mark up in red .
if we notice that an area has a lot of red marks , that means this area has a very high theft rate , yet a very low police case handling rate .
the area is not a good one .
we release such information to real estate companies and agents , which I believe can form an index .
I know that one or two pieces won &apos;t work , 10 or 20 won &apos;t help , 100 or 1,000 may make a difference , but if we collect tens of thousands of pieces together , the data will be very valuable .
why ?
I &apos;m not going to buy a property there , and I &apos;m not going to do business there .
this index will change the way people behave , as well as give some impetus to our government &apos;s actions .
in fact , such software can not only expose the evil side , and I believe , it can play a greater role in revealing the good side .
today , I &apos;m sure our audience here can divided into several groups . .
some of you are solving social problems , some of you hold Internet thinking and Internet tools , while the others neither are solving social problems , nor know what the tools are .
but you want to do something .
I hope that my speech today will open a window for all of you .
everyone can participate through the Internet , and every tiny power can be gathered and strengthened through the Internet .
qualitative change is produced through quantitative change .
everyone involved will find their own strength , and their power can be accumulated .
you will find you are not alone , and have many followers .
you are able to change the society and the environment .
discard your sense of in@@ capability and stop being an on@@ loo@@ ker .
take the initiative and use the tools at our disposal to encourage everyone to get involved in changing our society and shaping our bright future .
thank you !
in Feng@@ xian District , there is a century @-@ old shop called D@@ ing@@ feng S@@ au@@ ce Store .
it produces a kind of fermented bean cur@@ d called D@@ ing@@ feng Fer@@ mented B@@ ean Cur@@ d .
over the past 100 years , the outer packaging of D@@ ing@@ feng fermented milk has undergone great changes .
in the past , the customers took a small bowl with them .
now the fermented bean cur@@ d are packed in the vacu@@ um@@ ed bottles .
however , the crafts of making D@@ ing@@ feng fermented milk have remained the same .
just a bite of it will bring back your childhood memory . it tastes just the same .
this thing has set me to reflect on technology .
it seems to me that there exists something that is immune to the influence of technology , something that will stay constant despite the advancement of technology .
it occurs to me that each of us is like a piece of fermented bean cur@@ d .
why ?
although our fashion style is in constant change due to technology development , we change in some way as an individual .
in fact , we have not changed if we are seen as a whole .
in a sense , we human have not changed during the past hundreds of years .
in fact , we have not become smarter nor stronger .
because we have not changed , we are still just human .
my view is that there must exist something that is beyond the capacity of technology , something that we have been striving for from generation to generation .
we all know that in today &apos;s world knowledge is updating at speed .
for each of us , all our knowledge must be learned .
we cannot insert an USB card into our brains to instantly know things
neither can we inherit knowledge from our parents .
despite the fact that you are a Ph@@ .@@ D. , your baby must learn all over again as others do .
this is something that cannot be changed by technology .
this is what I want to talk about today .
we all know that technology are still moving forward , but we have no clue where it might lead us .
we all learned Newton &apos;s three laws .
these three laws enable us to predict the existence of Uran@@ us and Pluto .
today I want to talk to you about the &quot; three laws &quot; of learning technology .
because these three laws may shed some insights into how to digit@@ alize our education .
they may enable us to where education digit@@ alization may lead to in the future ten or twenty years .
the first law : no matter how technology develops , the essence of learning will always be self @-@ education .
it is impossible for us to transform knowledge into our brain through copying , clou@@ ding , or big data .
even you have many poems inserted into your &quot; cloud , &quot; you will not become a poet .
it has to be learned .
so what is learning ?
learning can be also called awareness , familiarity , acquisition , and mastery .
therefore , by its definition , this kind of learning takes time .
what is the second law ?
it is called : technology will take on a life of its own , independent of the inventor &apos;s will .
let me give you an example .
I do not know who invented key@@ boards .
we use key@@ boards all the time , but it has a special kind of use .
you can make someone kne@@ el on a keyboard .
I do not know if you have had a similar experience .
I once tried it .
the person who invented the keyboard would never imagine such a kind of use for his invention .
once a technology is invented , it will take on a life of its own .
therefore , what is the free will of technology ?
as we human being do , technology has an instinct to survive .
it wants to spread itself and expand its user base .
it does not care how we use it .
this is the free will of technology .
suppose you live in two hundred years ago , if you want to listen to music or watch a show , anytime and anywhere , the only way is to take a band or a group of dancers with you .
I want to see it now .
come and perform for me .
it is much simpler today .
all you have to do is to swi@@ pe on your iPhone .
you can watch it , anytime and anywhere .
this is the free will of technology .
it has a tendency to get cheaper and cheaper .
because the cheaper it is , the wider its user base will be .
it is probably beyond the imagination of Steve Jobs that every New Year &apos;s Eve the main purpose of using iPhone is to grab red envelopes online .
sometimes I spent the whole night grabbing red envelopes .
although half of the red envelopes was worth only 0.@@ 01 yuan , they still brought me joy .
in the end what is the ultimate purpose of technology ?
the ultimate purpose is not to have an iPhone , but to enjoy the happiness it brings me .
likewise , the ultimate purpose is not to invent a technology that understands us , but to get to know ourselves better through the application of technology .
however , technology has its own purpose .
it will make all attempts to know you better so then you will become more addicted to it .
this is the free will of technology .
the third law : benefits and risks of a technology will expand in the same proportion .
it means that as a technology brings more benefits , it will at the same time invite more risks .
the benefits and risks grow in the same proportion .
we have not seen the risks because they have been deliberately controlled .
however , the possibility is still there .
eventually , the risks will be seen .
the greater its capacity , the ris@@ k@@ ier .
atomic energy is such an example .
we are enjoying the benefits of atomic energy .
at the same time , we all want to avoid the possible risks , but the risks are still there .
the same goes for the application of technology in teaching .
it will inevitably lead to data analysis .
there is no doubt that data analysis will change our education in every way .
data analysis needs data from the user .
the more data a user offers , the more accurate the analysis is .
however , please note that the more powerful this data analysis becomes , the greater its risks grow .
let me give you an example .
it is common to have a medical examination , but many of us actually get fre@@ aked out over the identification of some disease .
the application of technology to education has far more important impacts .
unlike the machines , we are capable of feeling emotions .
imagine a child is diagnosed as intellec@@ tually challenged .
the child may come to believe he is destined to become a fool .
in this case , although the data analysis is accurate , it is against the spirit of education .
therefore , in terms of its application in education , the benefits and risks of technology will have a far significant impact .
under the guidance of these three laws , I want to predict how our education will evolve .
first , reaching the limit to one &apos;s learning capacity
what is the limit to one &apos;s learning capacity ?
think knowledge as water .
at the beginning , it was the size of a small pond .
later , as the technology develops , our knowledge grows as well .
the small pond turns into a lake and then into an ocean .
now think our brain as a spoon .
even if you are a genius , your spoon and an idiot &apos;s spoon will not differ much in size .
there is a limit to what you can hold with your spoon .
of course , each spoon may vary a little in size .
the amount of water that a spoon can hold is the limit to one &apos;s learning capacity .
in today &apos;s world , knowledge has become more and more accessible , so we do not have to memorize as much as we used to do .
most of us may remember less than ten phone numbers now .
in the past , we used to be able to remember the tunes and lyrics of a hundred songs , but now we sing Kar@@ ao@@ ke .
this change was made possible by the advancement of technology .
each of us has only one spoon .
if we are not critical of what to learn , the spoon will be easily filled .
so what is the most important thing to us ?
what is the most important thing to learn ?
in my view , there are three such capacities .
the first is our understanding of the world .
the second is our way of thinking .
the third is the ability to communicate and cooperate with others .
can these three capacities be developed directly without first acquiring the related knowledge ?
that is also impossible .
that is to say , in the process of acquiring knowledge , we need to build these capacities at the same time .
this first law , which is called the limit to our learning capacity , stays constant despite the advancement of technology .
it sets us to reflect .
it is of the most importance and relevance to us .
second , graphic thinking .
four or five thousand years ago , when there was no written language .
back then , our way of thinking can be seen as version 1.0 .
back then , people thought in a very con@@ create way , which was called figur@@ ative thinking .
their thoughts were in the form of images .
back then , when two person talked to each other , they would never say , &quot; let &apos;s we go picking pe@@ aches . , &quot; because there was no language yet .
imagine we are a couple living in the prehistoric time , how would we communicate ?
we would definitely communicate in a figur@@ ative way .
later , after the invention of written language , if I want to ask you to go picking pe@@ aches with me , I will just utter the words by mouth .
when I am speaking , what appears in my mind is the language or words rather than an image of me picking pe@@ aches .
my utter@@ ance of &quot; picking pe@@ aches &quot; will still stimulate the images of pe@@ aches in your mind , but in this case , you think in an abstract way rather than a concrete way .
we have all become abstract thinkers after a long period of study .
we are only concrete thinkers during the baby@@ hood .
once we start to learn to speak and write , it is difficult for us to stay as concrete thinkers .
now there are screens everywhere , such as our mobile phones .
communication goes beyond words .
here are some We@@ Chat emo@@ ji on the screen .
we can send an emo@@ ji to indicate that I am sleeping , I am eating , or I am angry without saying a single word .
these emo@@ ji are no longer words .
they are images .
therefore , we humans are entering a stage of graphic thinking , a brand new stage .
I believe that graphic thinking will be a key skill in the future work , which will emphasize designing capability .
therefore , I suggest that all of you here get your children some design education .
I have sent my daughter to designing classes .
third , the knowledge gap between a master and the general public are narrowing
it is often heard that due to technological development , there is no master in the real sense anymore .
though technology has been promoted , arts and humanities have been weakened .
I believe this view is only half correct .
technology has indeed grown more powerful .
the reason is that it has a survival instinct to spread itself .
however , it is wrong that humanities have been weakened .
on the contrary , humanities have been promoted as well .
it may appear that masters are diminishing , but we the public now enjoy more access to knowledge at the same time .
the knowledge gap between you and masters are narrowing .
one or two hundred years ago , most people had no access to knowledge .
therefore , if a person has access and is smart , he will become a master .
if I am smart , but I have no access to knowledge , then I will not have the chance to be a master .
a master is a master because the rest of the crowd know less than him .
now , the good news is everyone can become a master ; at least we are not so far away from becoming one .
therefore , when you look around , you see fewer peaks .
this is because the knowledge gap between the masters and us has been narrowed .
therefore , I predict more courses that guide us how to become a master through self @-@ regulation and by making the right choices may appear .
fourth , back to the starting line .
in my childhood , I read a poem .
it said , &quot; L@@ ush , lush grass on the plain , once every year it se@@ ars and grows . &quot;
every time I read this poem , I thought the person was so evil because he se@@ ared the grass every single year .
what a wicked person !
however , later when I grew up , I come to see that it is not an evil person who sets the grassland on fire .
it is God &apos;s design .
on the one hand , the fire kills pests and bacteria .
on the other hand , in my view , the fire creates an opportunity for all the plants to start af@@ resh , be they trees , shrubs or grasses .
technology keeps moving forward .
the owner of a technology may want to control more .
he hopes to control us and monitor us using his technology .
this complex is called &quot; the pleasure of God . &quot;
however , technology itself , as we have discussed , does not want to be controlled by individuals .
it only has an instinct to expand its user base .
however , once it is used in ways their invent@@ ors never foresee , it gets out of control and goes to its end .
it is like a burst of fire that burns everything up .
so what kind of courses should we offer ?
we need courses that teach our children the courage to start af@@ resh .
do we have such courses ?
yes , we do .
we have such games .
in the game , each time we are killed , we will start from the beginning again .
our children need courses of this kind badly .
last but not the least , emotional technology .
there is a popular animation recently .
it has a character called D@@ ab@@ ai .
although D@@ ab@@ ai is a robot , everyone loves him .
why ?
because he is so warm and caring .
have you wondered what are the ultimate goals of technology advancement and our learning ? where does they lead us ?
in fact , through the entire learning process , what we acquire is an emotional experience .
as I mentioned earlier , it is impossible to learn knowledge by inser@@ ting information into our brain because learning is a process .
in this process , we experience emotions .
the emotional experiences are what really matter .
the advancement of technology will finally contribute to the emotional experiences in education .
for example , if our textbooks are digit@@ alized and made available electronically .
where does the emotional experiences come from ?
the textbook will have traces of your learning .
it has a life .
it is living .
you can connect with it .
this is the emotional experiences technology offer .
there is a poem saying , &quot; Time was slower in the past ; the distance that carriage and horse walked were long while it took much time for mails to be delivered . you need your whole life to love the person that suits . &quot;
now the high @-@ speed rail is fast .
We@@ Chat message takes no time .
it seems that you can love many people in this life .
once emotion can be copied , it becomes meaningless .
therefore , the future of educational technology will be oriented to offering more emotion experiences .
we are looking forward to this change .
thank you !
do you know who the girl is in the picture ?
her name is Ma Ji@@ aj@@ ia , a girl of the post 90 &apos;s generation like me .
but , she is much more successful .
if I recall correctly , I still have a student loan of CN@@ Y 18@@ ,000 , by contrast , she is a CEO of an Internet company .
there are many things in her that I can learn from , things that I envy .
in my eyes , she is becoming more and more gorgeous .
you may wonder why we &apos;re talking about her .
a few days back , a speech of hers flooded my We@@ Chat Mom@@ ents .
the next day , my Mom@@ ents were in@@ und@@ ated with critics bombar@@ ding her .
so I couldn &apos;t help wondering what exactly have she said in her speech .
out of curiosity , I watched her controversial speech titled Des@@ per@@ ate College Students .
half way through , I realized , &quot; oh ! I am one of them ! &quot;
I am exactly one of those college students in her speech .
well , I have been a typical straight A student and well @-@ educated , but I may make much less money than those We@@ Chat retailers who like to bra@@ g about their leisurely and luxurious life , or those pun@@ sters who write jokes for a living .
I think college students with a rural background like me are most vulnerable to desperation after reading this article .
we are often confronted with people ta@@ un@@ ting us , &quot; You won &apos;t make much money after graduation , for diplom@@ as now are less rare and valuable .
the diplom@@ as of the post 80 &apos;s generation , who are trying to make a living in the cities after graduation , no longer nec@@ cess@@ arily guarantee you apartments , permanent urban residence certificates or jobs . &quot;
there used to be two classes of over 100 students when I was in the 6th grade .
but when I graduated from college , no more than 5 of us have college diplom@@ as .
where did the rest of them go ?
they went directly to work .
some of them came from a modest family .
families that financially struggled most was those that have to pay for the education of their children , just like mine .
being students means that we have little means of relieving their financial burden , yet the parents had to pay for our tuition every semester in college .
to these families , their children &apos;s education came at a high price .
that makes them more expec@@ tant of their children &apos;s earning potential . they expect these graduates to give back to the families immediately after graduation so that they could become rich overnight .
the pressure that I have mentioned , such as buying a hour@@ se and the rising house price , shr@@ in@@ ked employment caused by the expansion of college enrollment , as well as the jealousy against those rich We@@ Chat retailers , like Xia@@ ol@@ i .
these are very likely to sti@@ fle our hopes in ourselves , our education system , and the society .
however , I think this predicament is not caused by these factors , but our misunderstanding of college education .
college itself is never supposed to be a cradle of future million@@ aires .
it should stay true to its original function , which is to be a place for us to continuously acquire knowledge .
and college enrollment should be trimmed so that vocational and technical schools could flourish .
in this way , parents won &apos;t hold their hopes too high for their children who are admitted into decent colleges .
they won &apos;t think of college education as a fast lane to the pin@@ nacle of life , or sudden wealth .
Ma Ji@@ aj@@ ia mentioned in her speech that we , the desperate college students , would never become rich with outdated knowledge and hi@@ deb@@ ound jobs for the rest of our lives .
her speech The Des@@ per@@ ate College Students aimed to talk to the young people who y@@ earn for climbing up the social ladder and achieving financial independence .
I think I &apos;m one of them too .
however , rather than agreeing with what she said , I have a different message for the young people .
first , do not blindly focus on achieving the financial independence and the your social class transition while at a young age .
what are the consequences of expecting such things when you are still young ?
everyone would expect great fortunes to suddenly fall into their l@@ aps , when this era doesn &apos;t need that many million@@ ares .
every now and then I see people my age gathering together , despite the difference in their education background , and discussing about starting up Internet @-@ based businesses .
regardless of whether they are capable of doing it or whether their speci@@ alities can back their ambitions up , they all consider receiving investments as the sole standard of success .
the criter@@ a of judging a successful new business for them is whether they can get money from investors .
I don &apos;t believe this is a positive example for college students , because no college students in any country can make a fortune right after graduation .
I think It &apos;s okay to live a fru@@ gal life at a young age .
having an advanced education background does not necessarily guarantee anything .
no matter which country you are from , you have to learn to be a social man after graduating and starting to work .
one of my professors once said that anyone who isn &apos;t intellec@@ tually challenged can succeed in their line of business , or even rise to the top of the industry , as long as they work hard there for ten or twenty years .
why did he say that ?
no one can stay stick to it for 20 years .
in spite of the surviv@@ orship bias , what he said was intended to tell us was that each profession has a unique development cycle , which may not apply to other sectors , but you have to wait patiently , and accumulate as much knowledge and experience as you can .
this is the first message I want to give to myself and my peers .
second , we should slow down our pace to find out what we are really interested in .
it should be a process of us perfecting our inner selves and then improving the outside world .
richness should no longer be reg@@ are@@ ded as the most dominant or the only standard .
in my opinion , an ideal system is supposed to be like this .
when you are a kid , your part@@ ents and teachers will help you discover and explore your interests , so that you know if you are into math or sports , or if you are good at writing or physics .
then when your are going to college , you will have a clear idea of what you are interested in and what you like to choose your field .
the current education system and the upbringing of our generation have almost taken away our right to do so .
we are deprived of the right since we go to school .
the standard that measures our performance as students has always been our scores in examinations , the same standard applies in primary schools , then in senior high school entrance examination and college entrance examination .
choosing to major in science or liberal arts may be your only right .
if you are not strong @-@ minded enough , that right may be taken away by our parents .
when you graduate from college and fin@@ an@@ l@@ ly have the right to choose an occupation , I think it would be a pity to let money be the only criter@@ a of your career cho@@ ic@@ e.@@ If you just want a job that pays well and then miss the chance of exploring your true passion and talent , you may never have the chance to know what you really like to do .
the preface of a book written by Wang Xia@@ ob@@ o appeals to me .
in the preface he explains why he loves writing .
he says that in America business is business .
and the Americans are all about business .
but he chose to write books for a living , which , in their eyes , is arduous but fruit@@ less , equivalent to the physics process of anti @-@ entropy .
in other words , he chose to &quot; seek loss and avoid profits . &quot;
I don &apos;t really understand why he describes the development of human civilization as the process of anti @-@ entropy .
but I can &apos;t agree more with his argument that he chose writing because he believed he had a gift in writing and becoming a writer was his destiny .
in my eyes , this is a very brilliant standard for choosing a profession , you should choose your occupation based on your interests and your talent , you should think of your personal situation , instead of following the social trend or the money .
you should dedicate yourself to the profession that your &apos;re interested in , give everything you can and seek self @-@ fulfillment your whole life .
this is a choice that no one can blame or dis@@ respect you for .
the last message that I have for myself and you is that do not look down on knowledge only because you are in a sh@@ it@@ ty college .
I only read half of Ma Ji@@ aj@@ ia &apos;s speech .
in my opinion , it more or less indicates that knowledge will only be useful when it brings you fortune and well @-@ paid jobs .
this conclusion sounds arbitrary to me .
I don &apos;t know if knowledge could still change f@@ ates or if knowledge could still bring you fortune .
I assume the answer is negative , at least for the time being .
for knowledge is far less important in front of money .
but that does not matter , because the value of knowledge cannot be measured with your income .
I used to lo@@ athe reading books in the past , for I thought it went against my lifelong goal , which was to fulfill my personal well @-@ being .
T@@ i thought that being forced to read books would not add to my happiness , so I chose not to read much .
however , after studying in Peking University and reading many book , I find one sure benefit of reading is that it improves my ability of understanding and my judgment .
actually the failures of most people should not be impu@@ ted to their educational background , however , the less educated they are , the more likely their dignity is to be overwhelmed by money .
we may not be happy with our curriculum in college , but that should be not a reason for us to stop learning .
we all have more free than we think .
before fully en@@ o@@ ying the benefits of freedom , do not waste time complaining .
if you &apos;re from the countryside , read as many books as you can .
by doing so , you will be a better person from inside out .
and you won &apos;t feel hurt when people mention Phoenix man .
namely white collar worker from a working @-@ class background , or when people talks about how vulnerable poor students usually are .
this is my third message .
definitely , I &apos;m not trying to deny Ma Ji@@ aj@@ ia &apos;s money @-@ comes @-@ first point of view , because money matters to me as well .
my attitude towards money is that I &apos;m poor and broke and I don &apos;t give a crap about it .
I thus have been humili@@ ated by money for several times in my life .
in 2012 , after graduating from the undergraduate program , I didn &apos;t continue to pursue a master &apos;s degree .
instead , I accepted the offer for a low @-@ salary job from a foreign company .
in the beginning , I didn &apos;t have the money to rent a house .
when the Spring Festival was over and I was about to return to Beijing , my elder brother gave me 1000 yuan , even though he knew little about my plan after graduation .
I had no where to live .
my other elder brother rented a bedroom in a 3 @-@ bedroom apartment in Beijing .
I lived in his small room while he was on a business trip .
every day I was worried , because I didn &apos;t know where to go if my brother came back .
during that time , anxiety and worry were my constant company .
later , a friend of mine offered me a place to crash .
she also rented a bedroom in a 3 @-@ bedroom apartment .
she put the mattress on the floor for me , and slept on the hard bed board .
that &apos;s how I got through the first few months after graduation .
this kind of situation does not bother anymore .
I later became a postgraduate student but the feeling of helpl@@ essness during that time was in@@ ked in my mind .
even though I knew I was meant for a greater cause , I had to make some decision to try making as much money as I could .
every@@ time I looked back on my experience , I would feel embarrassed to criticize the money @-@ driven view of success .
after I have made some achievements in my career , an idea came to my mind .
I want to help those students who are desperate like I once was .
it is called &quot; To L@@ end a Hel@@ ping Hand , &quot; and the slogan is to help the poor graduates take the first steps into the workplace .
what exactly is the program ?
it helps you pay the first rent when you are going to rent a house after graduation .
the payment usually amounts to almost 10,000 yuan , including one month &apos;s rent as a deposit and three month &apos;s rent in advance .
there are many reasons for me to do it .
first , I know there are many students like me who have student loan , and who decide to stay in big cities but their parents have poured all their savings into their education .
I think some students need this 10,000 yuan to not just pay for the rent , but also the formal wear for work and cosmetics .
asking parents for money is the last thing they would do after graduation .
so I think they may need it .
those poor students living far way from their workplace also need this money .
when I was working for the foreign company , it usually took me 1 hour to go to work .
I had to transfer twice on the subway and then take a bus .
for many young people , I think the long @-@ time comm@@ ut@@ ation is a waste of their energe@@ y , this extra one hour could drain their passion for work .
so , it may not be a wise choice to live far away from your workplace to save money .
it may be very economical if this 10,000 yuan can help them live closer to their worl@@ places and save them some time and energy on the road , two of the most important things in life .
the last reason for this program is that no one is doing what we do .
financial supports , whether from the national government or commercial lending institutions , are all targeted at the students who have not graduated yet .
this may give rise to the sense of being forgotten once you graduate .
I think we should lend a hand to help them go through the transition between grad@@ ut@@ ation and financial independence .
I have discussed with my friends and explained to them what &quot; To L@@ ending a Hel@@ ping Hand &quot; is , but they all said it was impossible to raise any money because this program showed no promise .
I visited a few lending institutions with my exquisite P@@ PT .
to my surprise , they all expressed strong intention to help .
today , standing on this stage , I hope more people and institutions will join me .
my life motto is that as a human being , one must first fulfill his or her responsibilities , then fulfill his or her values and at last give back to the society if he or she can .
I think there are people who are financially capable of giving back .
so let &apos;s join hands to help the poor graduates who are no longer supported by the society and their families , the poor students who are not ready to make the living by their own and those who just enter the workplace .
with our help , they will be able to live closer to workplaces and more comfortably in big cities when all they have is dream .
with our help in the beginning of their career , may they have more freedom and hope , less burden and despair .
thanks !
hello everybody , welcome to the world of future !
suppose that you are here for a T@@ n@@ Dao lecture thirty years from now .
and a robot comes onto the stage .
he opens his power@@ point , gazing down at you with his arrogant eyes , and then says , &quot; Today my topic is &apos; you - the useless human beings &apos; . &quot;
yes , you hear me right . the robots are coming .
our first impression about robots might trace back to those cartoons we watched as a kid , like &quot; Astr@@ o Boy &quot; - o@@ ops , now you know I am really old - and &quot; Trans@@ formers . &quot;
and recently , AI - artificial intelligence - has begun to make headlines in the whole technology world .
we kind of feel , from the Hollywood block@@ bu@@ sters and the updates of science , that the earth will soon be conquered by Meg@@ at@@ ron .
we human beings , are becoming useless .
but don &apos;t panic .
actually it is not the first time that human beings have to face their us@@ elessness .
look at our body .
you know this ?
it is Shanghai International Mar@@ athon , a very fancy event .
you can see thr@@ ongs of people are running .
and on the left side , six @-@ pack abs . but let &apos;s just forget about it .
I just don &apos;t understand why men have to build such a big chest .
let &apos;s use a very trendy saying to comment : so what ?
but we all know that marathon indeed used to be useful .
during the ancient Greek period , there was a fight between Per@@ sia and Athens .
when the Per@@ sians were finally defeated , the army of Athens sent a messenger back to Athens to announce the good news .
this messenger ran at his utmost speed for 42 kilometers , until he finally reached Athens , told the people , &quot; C@@ lap ! we &apos;ve won the battle , &quot; and died .
to commemorate this good messenger , marathon was instituted .
now let &apos;s come to our muscles .
what &apos;s the use of men &apos;s muscles ?
for now , they are used for decoration .
men build in the gym a chest even larger than women .
and all they want to convey is : look how sexy I am .
muscles , too , unlike today , used to be very useful .
those robust muscles were crucial to hunting , snat@@ ching and carrying bri@@ des on men &apos;s back , and also making babies .
but today , muscles have long yielded to machines ever since the Industrial Revolution .
when we want to move , we don &apos;t need to run and exhaust ourselves .
a car , a nice car , and all the other tools are now encro@@ aching upon aesthetics , and even our mind .
let &apos;s suppose two men - the muscular man we just saw , and a fat man driving an A@@ ston Martin , suppose they both want to date a lay , who do you think get a better chance ?
muscles , or machines ?
men have already lost one battle .
but something more terrible is coming .
what kind of employees does a company need if it aims for the highest possible profits ？
useful people , of course .
what make you useful then ?
your human hands , basically .
but human beings as employees are sometimes so emotional that they can become a nuisance .
Henry Ford , just like any sham@@ eless capitalist , once said , &quot; Why is it every time I ask for a pair of hands , they come with a brain attached ? he will strike , fight me and cause troubles . &quot;
for a useful employee , it is pathetic to see that our position is being occupied by machines , and it &apos;s even worse to see that the capit@@ alists complain that we are now not useful enough .
now a more terrible thing happens .
apart from our muscles , our brain is also being rendered useless .
to illustrate the highest level of man &apos;s intelligence , we usually cite the chess game .
of course , some might argue that the game of go from the East is superior , but still , the chess should be the most globally acknowledged symbol of the summit of human intelligence .
unfortunately , in 1997 , the best human chess player was defeated by Deep Blue , a chess @-@ playing computer developed by IBM .
so scary !
our muscles are now useless .
so is our brain .
then who will need us ?
and there is something we need to notice about the man @-@ to @-@ computer chess competition .
deep Blue &apos;s developer of Chinese descent , once clarified that Deep Blue was actually not even near AI .
what ?
it was smarter than the most intelligent human being and beat him , and then you tell me it was not even near AI ?
yes indeed .
here is the terrible truth : machines are no longer our mere followers .
they are just different from us , and sometimes can turn out to be even more powerful than we human beings are .
let &apos;s think about how the chess game works .
you move a ch@@ ess@@ man , and that leaves your opponent a finite number of possibilities next .
if he is a good chess player like K@@ as@@ par@@ ov , he will then calculate , watch your face closely , and finally make the best move .
all this happens within a second .
but what this bulky &quot; Deep Blue &quot; does is just calculate based on all the possibilities and thus figure out the best move .
it is not AI .
it &apos;s just pure strength , for it can do hundreds of millions of calculations per second , while a human brain can never do that .
what a horrible shock !
machines have stopped just thinking like and following human beings .
it points to another direction for thinking .
today &apos;s AI , though using its own logic , can get the same result as people who calculate with their human logic want to get , and it does that much faster .
what I want to say is , as the machines grow and the cloud storage gets cheaper and cheaper , Francis Bac@@ on &apos;s dic@@ tum that &quot; Knowledge is power &quot; won &apos;t work anymore .
knowledge is no longer a power , and it &apos;s even not as powerful as this girl .
who is this stunning girl ?
her name is &quot; Madame Baidu . &quot;
it &apos;s O@@ k if you don &apos;t know her .
just Baidu it .
so you see , since Baidu can help you find anything , then if one day you just know &quot; what &quot; but not &quot; how and why , &quot; you will be useless .
useless .
what can we learn from that ?
we might not have so many years to live , but what about our children ? what can they do ?
if we just let them follow in our footsteps in learning , then perhaps one day they might really be replaced by machines .
all that they are learning today might become useless in future .
Henry Ford would be happy to see that .
but are we really going to be useless ?
at what are machines better than human beings ?
let &apos;s face the fact .
machines can connect fast , calculate fast , store an enormous amount of information , and they never need to rest .
but human beings must rest and sleep .
and we have emotions , while machines are always emotionally stable , and cheaper .
don &apos;t fight the machines .
if your job now maj@@ or@@ ly depends on memor@@ izing and matching things up , of if you are doing a simple , mechanical job , for example , a ticket seller , then you will definitely be replaced by machines .
you will become useless .
here is a very interesting report .
though it is rarely legi@@ ble , I save it for my own purpose .
the report is compiled by a famous consulting firm based on interviews with over 200 companies .
it is named &quot; Fast Forward 2030 : the Future of Work and the Work@@ place . &quot;
suppose it was 2030 now , which jobs would disappear ?
it lists twenty .
beside them are those jobs that are least likely to be replaced by machines .
you might not see it clearly , so let me read to you which jobs would disappear .
tel@@ emar@@ ke@@ ters .
good rid@@ dance . I hate tel@@ emar@@ ke@@ ters .
people working in sew@@ ers .
really , robots can do the sewer work .
and plus they never care whether it is dirty or hard , right ?
mathematical technicians .
wow , I used to think it is such an intelligent job .
insurance under@@ writers , watch rep@@ ai@@ rers , photographic process workers and library technicians .
like it says , the process work , customer work and vast swa@@ thes of middle management will simply disappear .
so if you find your kids are learning something close to those jobs , stop them right now .
but are we really so hopeless ?
and so useless ?
are we really being ruled by Meg@@ at@@ rons ?
of course not .
there are also jobs that will not be at risk .
I will not read them to you one by one , but will choose the highlighted ones .
directors of religious activities and education , supervisors of correc@@ tional officers , art directors , orth@@ odon@@ ti@@ sts - a dentist is also an artist - interior designers , producers and directors , photographers , fashion designers and architects .
that is about thirty years later .
if the scope extends to 20 years further , I guess the civil engineers now at the bottom of the safe job list might , however , be threatened then .
why ?
now comes my central point today .
my entire speech is for the purpose of making this very point .
many people tell me that today is the engineers &apos; world , for example , giants like Google are domin@@ ating the age .
but what I want to say is , the age for humanities scol@@ ars and students is coming .
a free but useless soul , that &apos;s what we who graduated from F@@ ud@@ an University always pursue .
life should be spent on beautiful things only .
why must we be useful ?
things should never be like that .
being useful is our weakness .
and it forces me to do something I don &apos;t like , such as chop@@ ping wood .
but now I &apos;ll just leave the wood to the machine .
the humanities are about the inner intr@@ ic@@ acies , psychology , personalities , emotions , art &amp; beauty , and religions of human beings .
what does that mean ?
people must come first .
but when we say we are useful , we are actually treating ourselves as a tool .
while we always know that man is an end in itself .
man as an end can never be replaced by machines , which are merely a means to an end .
some people may argue that machines also have their own will and thus will rule the world .
that is only human imagination in Hollywood block@@ bu@@ sters .
and it needs at least one hundred years to come true .
we &apos;ll just wait and see .
for now , till decades later , people who study the humanities will have a bright future .
please do shift your children to the humanities .
I &apos;m serious .
we may see engineers build the video streaming platform and system for You@@ ku and T@@ ud@@ ou in the early days , but now who are the big winners ?
directors , actors and producers .
you should know how much a copyright can gar@@ ner in the market .
so let &apos;s just be more open @-@ minded , and give back to machines what is machines &apos; and to men what is men &apos;s .
let machines work as they like .
and then what shall we human beings do ?
we &apos;ll set eyes on poetry and the world beyond .
what is the world beyond ?
it is in the poem &quot; Dist@@ ant ver@@ d@@ ure overcome the ancient highways ; Fair @-@ day emer@@ ald stret@@ che the away to waste cities . bidding farewell to wan@@ derers going some@@ whither , L@@ ush @-@ growing grasses w@@ aft in the breeze full of parting cares . &quot;
what is the world beyond ?
it is in the poem &quot; Star@@ ting tomorrow , I &apos;ll be carefree and happy . ro@@ aming the world , feeding my horse , chop@@ ping firewood . starting tomorrow , I &apos;ll need nothing but rice and a few vegetables . in my house by the sea , warmed by the spring air . &quot;
if you ask me where I am going ?
I &apos;ll just point my finger to where the sea mur@@ mur@@ s .
thank you !
marriage is no necessity .
Chang@@ jian actually agrees with it .
he only regrets that he was born 20 years earlier .
are you married ?
does your mom urge you to get married ?
will you get married ?
have you ever thought about ta question : what &apos;s the point of getting married ?
once , or for most of Chinese history , the question had been a taboo .
why is that ?
because marriage has been a must for Chinese , wester@@ ners aside , over quite a long time .
first of all , men need to marry women for reproduction .
here are two pictures I found online .
one was taken at the end of Qing dynasty , in the middle of which is a man , who seems to be rich , sitting with his wife and concub@@ ine , one on each side of him .
in fact , it was quite common for men to marry more than two women at that time .
Gu Hong@@ ming , the then professor of Peking University with queue as well as a thorough knowledge of both western and traditional Chinese civilizations , had once said that the best marri@@ ge involved one husband and four wives .
he made an analogy that one teap@@ ot is always set with four cups , because they are perfectly together .
this picture was taken in the 19@@ 20s when marriage was necessary for both men and women .
at that time , men need marriage for pro@@ creation , not to mention women who were in particular want of marriage .
just as the saying goes : &quot; marrying a man is for food and clothing . &quot;
therefore , you leave your parents and move to another family , your husband .
in the eyes of mo@@ den people , marriage was the career of every woman at that time .
can you live without working ?
no .
so , at that point , marriage was women &apos;s career , and your husbands were your bosses .
at that time , a husband might be away from home for years .
he might come back home once in a year , or even once in five years or ten years , claiming that he &apos;s pursuing his career .
at the same time , the wife took care of children and elders at home and counted on the husband to support the family .
the husband , however , might have mist@@ resses in different places , or , take one , two or three concub@@ ines .
but he would never divorce his first wi@@ ve .
don &apos;t worry .
although the husband might give the wife the cold shoulder day after day , the wife , as a dominant figure among his women , controlled the purse strings of the family all the time .
it was the wife who was buried with the husband after death , and for sure , the name of the wife would be carved on the tom@@ b@@ stone , showing her honor .
I don &apos;t know whether concub@@ ines had the honor .
anyhow , getting married was of great significance during that era .
another picture I found online is a representative of the wedding pictures in 1980s .
the wedding pictures at that time were particularly recognizable .
the newly married couple were holding a bunch of plastic flowers ; the bride was wearing a wedding veil and a fake pearl necklace .
the picture on the left is a still of tal@@ ky Zhang D@@ amin &apos;s Happy Life , a TV drama produced in 1998 .
the TV drama is quite interesting , worth watching if you are interested .
it tells the life story about a men named Zhang D@@ amin , an ordinary worker in Beijing , who was born in 1950s and laid @-@ off in his middle age .
it is not uncommon for this generation to have four or five siblings ; Zhang D@@ amin was the eldest brother of four brothers and sisters .
the family squeezed in a tiny courtyard house .
their father who was a worker has passed away for long .
as the eldest brother , one of the primary tasks of Zhang D@@ amin was to to make room in the pocket @-@ size home to get his younger brothers married .
he had developed a skill of making the most of space .
the five siblings had used to sleep on bun@@ k beds .
thanks to Zhang D@@ amin &apos;s skill , one of his brothers got a private space to get married , which was se@@ pr@@ ated from others by a curtain .
unfortunately , his eldest sister was unmarried though she was above 30 years old .
she became a transgres@@ sor of the family , as she occupied the room for her future sister @-@ in @-@ law .
the youngest brother finally couldn &apos;t tolerate the predicament , so he applied for a university which was far away from home .
before he left , he said to his elder brothers in tears that their home was so small that he wanted to leave .
Zhang D@@ amin built a 6 square meters hut in the courtyard when himself got married .
despite his effort , he couldn &apos;t remove the tree in the hut , so the hut accommodated the couple and the tree which was as tall as the wall .
in the 6 square meters hut with a tree , Zhang D@@ amin welcomed the birth of his son and named the newborn Xia@@ os@@ hu which meant small tree .
so , the life of Zhang D@@ amin was bitter@@ sweet .
worse still , Zhang D@@ amin got laid @-@ off and only had some vacuum fl@@ asks which were the products of the factory as subsidies .
at that time , marriage used to hold a very important meaning .
I remember when I was a kid , it was a custom in Shanghai that bride@@ g@@ rooms should call out a sentence on the street , with a g@@ ong sometimes .
would you please call it out with me ?
&quot; I become a man today ! &quot;
&quot; I become a man today ! &quot;
do you post @-@ 8@@ 0s know it ?
your father might have done the same on the wedding day if you are from Shanghai .
what does it mean ?
it means the bridegroom could have sex legally from that day on because pre@@ marital sex was forbidden .
men might be convicted of ho@@ olig@@ anism because of pre@@ marital sex .
and pre@@ marital sex would be a reproach to girls .
thus , people used to attach a great importance to marriage .
after all , you can enjoy basic human rights only after marriage , right ?
where is the applause ?
marriage was the licence to the basic rights of citizens .
it was the story mere 30 years ago .
nevertheless , China had witnessed so many changes over the past 30 years .
although I said the view that marriage is unnecessary came from the future .
the opinion actually ger@@ min@@ ated seven or eight years ago , on which day exactly ?
on the very day when the words &quot; lefto@@ ver ladies &quot; appeared in media .
having been a psychological counselor for 11 years , I would like to consider myself an expert on lefto@@ ver ladies .
over the 11 years , I probably have heard 1,000 @-@ 2,000 stories about the marriage and relationship of the Chinese .
the words &quot; lefto@@ ver ladies &quot; have caught my eye the moment I saw them , so I looked close into the group .
I realised that my clients are not only the couples who are going through a divorce but also the so @-@ called lefto@@ ver ladies .
the ladies are well @-@ educated ; some have studied abroad .
they have decent jobs , fat salaries and gorgeous appearance .
they came for one question : why should I get married ?
I don &apos;t like anyone in per@@ tic@@ ular .
I don &apos;t love anyone in per@@ tic@@ ular .
I don &apos;t think that my life is im@@ complete and that I need a husband .
but everyone , especially my parents and grandparents , tell me it is unacceptable to be unmarried . &quot;
she went to ask her mom , who was born in the 1950s , why she should get married .
her mon said : &quot; cut the crap . it is a meaningless question . everyone will get married . every normal person will get married . marriage is never for happiness and love ; marriage is for living . I married your father without love and gave birth to you , don &apos;t you live a happy life ? &quot;
the parents of lefto@@ ver ladies were born in 1950s and married at the end of 1970s and the beginning of 1980s .
it was a luxury if they married for love and happiness in those days .
I had TV shows and radio shows before .
when I was working at the Eastern People &apos;s Broadcasting Station , I answered the calls from the audiences of a programme called &quot; Harmon@@ ious Home . &quot;
the programmed was on from 12 : 00 to 13 : 00 , so most of the calls were made by the senior in their 6@@ 0s .
in most cases , they were worried about their unmarried children .
they would start the conversation by saying &quot; Ms Wu , my daughter is very outstanding . &quot;
after plenty of similar calls , I would interrupt them by saying &quot; ah , she is lefto@@ ver , isn &apos;t she ? &quot;
in the end , they wouldn &apos;t dare to make such calls any more .
my behaviour got the broadcasting station in trouble , as the seniors often complained against me to the publicity department .
they said I was misleading the young and propag@@ ating he@@ res@@ y .
from their wording , I in@@ ferred that they lived through the Cultural Revolution .
I troubled the editors of the broadcasting station a lot .
your parents , or the people of that generation , may know nothing about love and happiness , but you do .
whether you have experienced them or not , or maybe you see them only in films and TV dramas , you have the right to ask the question today that why I get married .
you have received the higher education , you earn over RMB 10,000 per month , you have studied abroad , or you have travelled in ten countries , and you are here , at T@@ n@@ Dao , you have the right to search for the answer .
what is the significance of marriage ?
if we examine the reasons for women to get married in the 19@@ 20s , the 1980s and today , we can see that women back then had no jobs . , which is totally different from today .
and at that time , couples were required to be well @-@ matched in social and economic status .
they shouldn &apos;t be expecting to move up the social ladder through marriage .
if you &apos;re a middle class , you should marry a middle class .
if you &apos;re a working class , you should marry a working class .
Yu@@ any@@ uan laid emphasis on money ; frankly speaking , I don &apos;t despise material women .
they have a clear goal of marriage which is to obtain better economic status .
it is a simple expectation .
women who want only money from marriage and improve the@@ i financial status will not be lefto@@ ver , because their purpose of getting married falls on one thing , money .
the possibly lefto@@ ver ladies are the girls who want everything from marriage .
people have acc@@ pe@@ ted idea that marriage is not a must .
the figures given by the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau in 20@@ 14 showed that men in Shanghai got married for the first time at the age 30.@@ 11 , women at the age of 28.@@ 14 .
as a student of liberal arts , I am not good at mathematics , but the figures shocked me that people in Shanghai waited so long to get married , don &apos;t you think so ?
the average age of first marriage is 30 years old .
showing that many , the female included , are not married until over 30 years old .
I am curious about the Chinese &apos;s future view on marriage .
are you curious as well ?
it is easy to predict it by having a look at the developed countries .
a friend of mine married a Finnish , so I asked her for help .
she found the figures below .
in 20@@ 14 , the Finnish authority published the average age of first marriage was 30 years old for women in Finland , which was similar to the figures for Shanghai .
after ten year &apos;s marriage , it comes the time of divorce , so the average age of first divorce is 39 years old .
over the past 20 years , the divorce rate in Finland has been stable at 55 % , but the marriage rate has been dropping .
it would be the future of Shanghai in 10 , 20 or 30 years .
over half of couples would get divorced , and half of children would come from single @-@ parent families .
in the countries like Finland , the fam@@ ale are independent with respect to economy and spirit , and legitimate and illegitimate children have the same civic rights .
for the young Chinese today , marriage is just a licence to raise children .
it is common to have online romance via apps like Mom@@ o , so it is fine to be single .
people need love and sex .
but love , sex and marriage are not the same thing .
they are independent from one another , but interdependent at times .
in most cases , they are independent from one another .
it is not my thoughts but the facts I have been noticed , summar@@ ised and recorded .
it is intriguing that in August , 2011 , The Economist , a serious English @-@ language magazine focusing on economics , published a cover story , Asia &apos;s Lon@@ ely Hear@@ ts - Why Asian Women Are Re@@ jec@@ ting Marriage and What That Me@@ ans .
you can browse it online if interested .
I found a very detailed Chinese translation of the article via Baidu yesterday .
the writer did a survey and found out that the proportion of the unmarried professional women in their 30s and 40s who received higher education reached 25 @-@ 35 % in the developed Asian countries and regions .
it is interesting that the writer said similar phenomena were not found in China and India , the two largest developing countries in Asia .
if you ask me , that &apos;s absolute nonsense .
I started my Relationship Camp in March 2011 and realised that similar phenomena had shot up in China , at least in the higher @-@ tier cities .
my conservative estimate on the percentage of single well @-@ educated women in their 30s is 25 % in Shanghai .
my Relationship Camp attracted the attention of media at home and abroad , particularly the foreign media .
A@@ FP , C@@ BS , ABC and others interviewed me .
they believed that the increase in the number of women reluctant to get married reflected the progress of China &apos;s 30 @-@ year Reform and Opening Up and was an inevitable result of China &apos;s ballo@@ oning GDP .
I remember we learned in middle schools that production relations are determined by productive forces , am I right ?
the marital relation is a kind of production relations .
when they had no access to education and jobs , women had to get married .
but the necessity has disappeared .
the picture was taken in 19@@ 31 .
the girl with short hair and wearing western suits is my grandma .
the photo records a group of fre@@ in@@ ds .
females like them in those days were trendy .
they were the first patch of Chinese female university students .
my grandma ma@@ jo@@ red in laws .
after graduation , they went abroad for further study .
it was unprecedented for women to have short hair , wear western clothes and attend schools , not to mention to work and to sit as equals at the same table with men .
I am afraid it was as stressful for them as the current unmarried females in their 30s .
what worries women changes with time .
modern females have more choices .
the photo was taken in 2015 , exactly yesterday .
you can find me wearing the same suit in the photo .
I am a member of the club called the Club of Thir@@ teen Women ; the head is Jian Fang .
there are only 11 members in the photo ; a post @-@ 8@@ 5@@ s photographer took it for us .
we wanted to take a picture before we are too old , so we went to a photographic studio yesterday .
all the women in the photo were in their 40s .
seven of them gave speeches at T@@ n@@ Dao .
you can find well @-@ known host@@ esses , the partners of the Big Four , female entrepreneurs , sop@@ ran@@ o artists and me here .
some of them are single ; some married three times ; some are D@@ IN@@ K@@ s ; some are single mothers .
therefore , modern women are much more fortunate than the women in 19@@ 31 .
modern women can decide to get married or not on their own will .
you have the right to get your answer and you will not be forced to get married by the tears of families .
women shall decide their own marriage .
in the end , I would like to quote a line from a play : a city without g@@ ays and lefto@@ ver ladies can &apos;t be an international metropolis !
thank you .
well , I &apos;d like to talk about a question I ask myself , as the title goes , who is the winner of life .
fundamentally , all through our life , we are trying to find answer to three questions .
where am I from ?
who am I ?
where am I going ?
to define the winner of life is to answer the question of &quot; where to go . &quot;
I guess we all have our own answers .
at least I have .
but I am here not because I know the answer .
actually I don &apos;t know the answer .
but I tried to answer it .
I graduated here .
I was a student here since 1995 .
before then I had set a goal for myself and thought I would be a winner of life when I made it .
I dreamt of becoming a writer .
why ?
because I was born in the 1970s when there was no such things as mobile phones .
I didn &apos;t even have a TV until I was in middle school .
back then , only through literature could we attain to the widest world .
and I thought if one day I could have my own work published , my name would be known to many .
that would be my biggest success .
then at this university , I got acquainted with students from across the country and overseas and I got to know how big the world is out there .
I hoped to travel across the globe to see more of the world .
later , the Internet came to China .
and Bill Gates came to our campus to promote his book The Road A@@ head .
he immediately aroused a sensation among students .
we all wanted to become someone like Bill Gate who could change the world .
yes , We wanted to change the world , travel around the world and conquer the world so that our names could be known to all .
we believed that if we could accomplish any of the above dreams , we would be a winner of life .
yes , I used to set such goals .
so I abandoned my dream of becoming a writer , and suspended the idea of traveling around the world .
I decided to start my own business , make it go public and go as big as it can .
looking back , it was all something of a flu@@ ke .
life &apos;s full of twists and turns that are hard to explain .
at the age of 36 two years ago , I kind of realized the goals I had set .
I published a book entitled A Short Flight .
just one month ago its traditional Chinese version was published in Taiwan .
last week I attended the book launch in Taipei .
to my surprise , some people love it , which makes me really happy .
it actually sells well .
wow !
whenever I am called a writer , I feel even happier , although I &apos;m just an amateur one .
also two years ago , I had one more company successfully listed on Nasdaq .
the thing is , when you made it , you discovered your peers also did so .
just now , at the hall gate I actually met an old pal who also owns a listed company .
so , I didn &apos;t want to show off my IPO record anymore .
then , I wanted to travel around the world .
to this end , I set a few targets for myself , including setting foot on five continents .
I might not be able to visit every country one by one , but at least I could fly to major continents , where I could travel around by bicycle .
by 20@@ 13 , I had cycl@@ ed through the most beautiful road on each of the five continents .
by &quot; most beautiful , &quot; I mean the most beautiful in my eyes .
well , I had cycl@@ ed through 11 to 12 countries .
when I finished it , I somehow had a sense of achievement .
but a sudden void hit me on December 31 , 20@@ 13 .
and I felt myself shallow and ridiculous .
because I realized my previous goals were based on how others looked on me .
for example , to launch a successful IPO , you will have to persuade all relevant parties that your company has everything required to be an ideal IPO .
in other words , you have a publicly visible fortune .
but that does not prove anything more than your business sense and your good luck of seizing the opportunity .
is that you ?
when you are in a bank or a supermarket , all clerks there know who you are .
so what ?
do you know yourself ?
can you sleep tight at night ?
travelling around the world .
I have a couple of friends who have been to some 100 countries .
they may not be known to the public , but they are always on the way .
I have a very close friend who &apos;s a veteran traveller .
I once told him that I read one of his articles , a very nice piece , which answered a question I had wanted to ask him .
I had wanted to ask him , &quot; what &apos;s next when you complete your travel around the world ? &quot;
at the end of that article , he wrote , &quot; Life is too short for anyone to reach every corner of this planet . &quot;
in 2007 , I fell in love with cycling .
it was also that year that I completed my first bicycle trip to the French city of Nice on the Az@@ ure coast .
one night , I was sitting by the sea , drinking .
and I couldn &apos;t feel more at ease .
what are we looking for all through our life ?
a key to un@@ locking our life .
I never felt so free and assured of my life .
I thought I really loved it .
thus I said , &quot; You won &apos;t know how to love this world until you truly fall in love with something . &quot; this is also what I want to share with you guys here .
but what is love ?
this is something that must be figured out .
try asking others what they love .
they &apos;d say , &quot; I love music , I love traveling or I love reading . &quot;
then you &apos;ll probably find that they only listen to pop songs on music charts and read best @-@ sellers , which means they have the same poor taste as airport book@@ stores .
can that be described as &quot; love &quot; ?
I prefer to call it &quot; interest . &quot;
when you love something , you feel like dev@@ oting yourself wholeheartedly to the sea .
after that trip , after cycling through a dozen more countries , after reading over 100 books about bicycles , when visiting the cool@@ est bicycle shop in town wherever I go , when making friends with bicycle lovers from around the world , and when the images of bicycle were shown on my buttons , socks , book @-@ ends and discs , I clearly felt my love for bicycles .
my just published book is also about bicycles .
as an amateur writer , I am sorry for not having focused on something gran@@ der and greater .
I just took down my inspir@@ ations from bicycles .
I completed most of this book on the plane .
for a time , I travelled frequently on business trips , during which I did writing whenever I couldn &apos;t fall asleep .
when I truly felt bicycle to be important part of my life , I made the decision to enter the industry of bicycle manufacturing .
I thus wrote a letter to our board of directors last October , telling them that I wanted to make my love of bicycles more meaningful .
there is only one way to prove your love of something , that is , to devote more time in perfecting it .
I decided to devote all my rest passion and creativity to bicycles .
and I believe someday you &apos;ll also find your true love .
all through our life , we experience ups and downs .
nevertheless , the most important of all is to find the very thing , the key to un@@ locking life .
this is the first thing I learnt from cycling .
the second thing I learnt form it is acceptance .
I was once caught in a rain when cycling .
a sudden rain is the most terrible thing in long @-@ distance cycling trips .
what else ?
roadside breakdown .
anything more ?
navigation failure .
getting lost .
are you puzzled by the last one ?
with a mobile phone in hand , how can one get lost ?
in my early days of cycling , mobile navigation wasn &apos;t that accurate .
that day , I was lucky enough to encounter three of them once for all .
I was blindly riding on my bicycle , not knowing which direction to go .
my map got wet in the rain , and I could not see it clearly .
cycling maps are of 1 : 100,000 scale and hard to read when wet .
then my body temperature began to drop .
worse still , the bicycle broke down .
it eventually got fixed , although it took a long time .
noticing that my body temperature was declining , I became very nervous .
fortunately , I suddenly saw someone at the roadside .
with a cigar in his mouth and a wide @-@ brim@@ med hat on his head , he was walking slowly back and forth in the rain , training a hunting dog .
my original intention was to ask him the way .
but when I approached him , I couldn &apos;t help asking , &quot; Sir , why do you keep hunting in the rain ? &quot;
he looked at me and said , &quot; L@@ ad , who said only sunny day is nice and rainy day isn &apos;t ? &quot;
his words were what touched me most in the cycling trip .
you know what ?
my last long @-@ distance journey was to Argentina .
it was May , the beginning of rainy season in Argentina .
I went to the south and stayed there .
and it began to rain the day I arrived .
the hotel owner asked what I was there for .
I said I was there for cycling .
he said , &quot; Oh , didn &apos;t you guys from the Northern Hem@@ isphere know that it &apos;s now rainy season in the South . our season is just opposite to yours . &quot;
no laughter .
it seems you guys have never been to the Southern Hem@@ isphere .
ha@@ ha .
during that trip , every day , except one sunny day , I set off in the rain and reached a destination in the rain .
yet , this did not prevent me from enjoying the en@@ chanting view of Argentina .
it was as fantastic and beautiful as described in Bor@@ ges &quot; novels .
I could appreciate the beauty because I learnt that &quot; sunny day is nice ; so is rainy day . &quot;
indeed , what I saw in the rain along the way in the lake region in south Argentina was a dream @-@ like wonder@@ land .
and there &apos;s no way one can experience it in sunny days .
life is unpredictable .
how can you expect it to be a barrier @-@ free one ?
no way .
starting a business doesn &apos;t necessarily lead you to a successful IPO .
my third , my first venture was near our university .
when I failed , I only went out after 9@@ pm everyday , for a night walk , with a bottle of Er@@ gu@@ ot@@ ou liquor in pocket , because I was too embarrassed to meet acquaintances .
I had believed myself smart enough to change the world .
but I failed at the startup stage .
the worst of all was that no one even knew you failed .
you guys are laughing . so un@@ compassionate !
there is a lot more that I learnt from cycling .
when I was on a cycling trip , I often thought about such things as death can happen to anyone anytime .
that &apos;s beyond our control just like we cannot decide whether to come to this world .
no one can predict that .
life is so unpredictable .
when you think about that , life becomes so void and meaningless .
for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return . the in @-@ between period is too short to be wasted on the trivial .
one needs to find some reason to love this elusive world and makes it meaningful .
what else would I like to share with you ?
you guys turn too fast .
Oh , right .
this is the last .
in my opinion , there is no such thing as winner of life .
it &apos;s all about how to make choices on your life journey .
and your choices constitute your lifestyle .
that is the only thing truly belonging to you and it has nothing to do with life condition , wealth , judgment of others , or whether you can change the world .
I am happy that at a critical stage of my life I at least had such a reflection and that I could spend time on what I truly loved .
if I have to answer that question I raised in the beginning , I &apos;d say the winner of life is someone who finds and does something that makes him or her really happy .
I remember a poet once said in his later years , &quot; To think that once I was the same man did not embarr@@ ass me . &quot;
yes , it was said by Cz@@ es@@ law Mil@@ os@@ z in his later years .
I regard it as an important y@@ ard@@ stick for my life wisdom .
what can be controlled now that life is essentially unpredictable ?
it is what we should spend our short life @-@ time on .
I know I &apos;m a very very lucky person , as I have found the thing I truly love and I have an ability and opportunity to pursue it .
as far as I know , not many people have such courage .
so I &apos;ll cherish it and also hope all of you can find the happiness of your own .
thank you all !
before I start , let &apos;s take a look at Steve Jobs !
I suppose everyone has heard of Steve Jobs &quot; famous speech at Stanford in 2005 .
do you remember his last sentence ?
anyone ?
I &apos;ll give this book as the prize .
stay hungry , stay foolish .
you all know it .
but what I want to say is that there was a very important point in his speech which is ignored by most people .
that point was , &quot; remember that you are going to die . &quot;
this was the most important proverb that guided Jobs forward .
he even considered it as one of the most important tools when making major decisions .
I remember that he read a quote when he was 17 : &quot; if you live each day as if it were your last , someday you &apos;ll most certainly be right . &quot;
since then , he would look in the mirror every morning and ask himself , &quot; If today were the last day of my life ... &quot; and so on , and so on .
so does everyone understand now ?
do you know how he died ?
he was scared of death .
from 17 to 56 , he feared death every day for thirty @-@ nine years , because he always thought that he was going to die .
so do you get it now ?
death is the most important thing for human beings .
so what if humans didn &apos;t die ?
if humans didn &apos;t die , then a general manager and a prime minister become the same thing .
what am I going to say today ?
in fact , I personally think that after 30 years , when we get to 20@@ 46 , you will actually find out that death is not a law of nature .
death is exactly the same as catching a cold .
it &apos;s a disease .
the thing that matters is how we fight it .
the evolutionary history of humans from 4.5 million years ago to the present is definitely not just an evolution in height , it &apos;s also been an evolution of life .
what happens when this law of nature is subdued by future technology ?
we humans do not have to die .
there are a lot of problems that plague humans , and they can be solved easily .
how can human beings live forever ?
what I am going to say is a little bit superficial , so I have chosen some fragments to share .
there are six technologies which will keep our semiconduc@@ ting bodies alive forever .
let &apos;s talk about 3D printing first .
your ear doesn &apos;t work well ?
change it .
if your eye doesn &apos;t work well , take it out and switch it for a new one .
this is no longer science fiction .
this is a reality that is starting to happen .
if your brain lacks a certain component , you can actually use this repair technique .
this is not a problem .
this is the most important part of a man , the kidney .
this is the most important part of a bad guy , the heart .
any organ that you can imagine can be made by today &apos;s biological 3D printers .
this is not science fiction , this is what is happening now .
3D printing can print out organs piece by piece , which you might find to be a very strenuous process .
so let &apos;s take a look at a simpler thing , cloning .
this is the first cloned sheep in human history .
everyone knows that it is Dol@@ ly .
it was cloned from a female sheep .
so you can picture the future .
if we ignore human ethics , every human being can have its own clone .
what will that be like ?
ladies and gentlemen , that means when your nose has a problem , you can take a nose from your clone ; when your ear has a problem , you can take an ear from it , too , right ?
the younger you are , the more valuable your cloned body will be to you .
everyone here , take advantage of this while you &apos;re young , okay ?
don &apos;t wait until you are sixty or seventy years old to clone yourself .
it would be very un@@ economical at that time .
this is already happening , and we are not talking about human ethics .
what we said just now is the concept of organs , which goes from the outside to the inside .
so now let &apos;s talk about things from the inside out .
nan@@ otechnology is now very well developed .
in fact , nan@@ otechnology is now playing a big role for our human body .
you know , Richard F@@ ey@@ n@@ man is a very famous physicist in American history and also won the Nobel Prize .
Richard F@@ ey@@ n@@ man was one of the best question @-@ asking physic@@ ists in American history .
his famous motto is , &quot; A question without an answer is not the most painful thing in the world , rather , an answer without a question is . &quot;
he was fond of asking questions .
once he was sick and needed surgery .
before he was anes@@ the@@ tized , he was lying on the operating table and asked the doctor a question .
he said , &quot; Doctor , why are you standing here with a scal@@ pel to cut my stomach and operate on me instead of turning into a peanut and doing the surgery from the inside ? &quot;
the doctor said , &quot; It &apos;s better if you are anes@@ the@@ tized . &quot;
this thing may have been considered a joke a few decades ago .
but today , it is no longer a joke .
now our nan@@ otechnology has reached the point where we can pack two thousand such nanop@@ articles in one red blood cell .
what can such nanop@@ articles do ?
they can circulate in your blood , be combined with your cancer cells , and even kill cells or ward off disease .
what does that mean ?
it means that in the future , in our blood , in addition to our normal human biological cells , there will be nan@@ oc@@ ells of different functions that can alert , diagnose , and even kill all kinds of bad cells .
this is not science fiction ; this is what is happening now .
let &apos;s take a look at cells .
the most important cells are our embryonic stem cells .
embryonic stem cells are primitive cells that can be transformed into functional cells in all parts of our body .
so what can embryonic stem cells do now ?
this is what Austrian bi@@ ogen@@ e@@ tici@@ sts did in the laboratory in 20@@ 13 .
can you tell what this is ?
what is it ?
who can tell ?
I will give this book to whoever gets it .
what ?
an infant ?
no .
it &apos;s not that cruel ; it &apos;s the human brain of a person who is dying .
in order to save him , they cultivated a new brain in their laboratory with his stem cells .
now the technology has grown to the point where you don &apos;t need your embryonic stem cells to do something like this , as you only need one of your s@@ omatic cells .
you have to know just how well developed the technology is now .
that is , in the future , we can take any type of biological cells , synthesize them into a liquid in the laboratory , and then put them into a 3D printer and make any shape we want to eat .
there is another very cool thing that is happening .
there is a firm called Green Farm in America .
the company now also makes artificial leather through s@@ omatic cell technology .
this leather is exactly the same as real leather , with pores in it .
but what advantages does it have ?
if I want to make a bag , I have to kill a cow , a pig , or a seal , but with this technology I don &apos;t need to kill at all , I just need s@@ omatic cells for synthesis .
and after two weeks , what will happen ?
I will directly grow them into a bag instead of a piece of leather .
see ?
this is the future ; this is what is happening .
let &apos;s take a look at genes .
genes are no stranger to us , and now many screen@@ ings for babies rely on them .
in fact , nowadays , both gene replacement technology and gene repair technology are very popular in developed countries .
if you can find out what kind of pathogenic genes your baby has in advance , you can use gene repair technology to make him into a normal child .
does anyone know this person ?
I &apos;m going to have a hard time giving away my book .
this is a famous researcher at the University of Washington .
he studied cancer gen@@ om@@ ics , but unfortunately he got acute leukemia some time ago .
he was very talented .
he didn &apos;t think he deserved to die .
he said , &quot; I am a cancer researcher . how can I die of cancer ? &quot;
so he used himself as a test sample and repaired himself in the lab .
and then ?
he survived .
this is what is happening .
you can go to Washington University to visit him if you are interested .
finally we have the infl@@ ection point of 20@@ 46 , the so @-@ called AI , artificial intelligence .
what will AI be like by 20@@ 46 ?
if you have seen Machine E@@ ra star@@ ring Ban@@ der@@ as , you will know that in 20@@ 46 , 30 years later , humans will do nothing .
why ?
because everything will be done by robots .
of course , there will be a group of human policemen who will patrol day and night and supervise these robots .
why ?
because robots are , to a certain extent , very dangerous once they become self @-@ healing , self @-@ repairing , self @-@ coordinating , and generate their own consciousness .
why ?
imagine what would happen if they held a Rob@@ otic Congress one day ?
a robot says , &quot; We have figured out that human beings are useless ! everything is done by us , right ? why should we listen to them , and why should they live off of us ? shall we vote to kill them ?
there will be a 50 % chance that we will be killed .
therefore , there will be a group of human policemen in the future who will supervise the robots day and night .
but is this really feasible ?
as a result , famous scientists like Haw@@ king are now increasingly worried about what will happen when artificial intelligence gains self @-@ awareness .
will it destroy the earth and humans ?
artificial intelligence has developed to a certain extent .
do you know what its best advantage is ?
there are many diseases that we cannot diagnose , nor overcome .
what if robots created by us finally surpass us ?
maybe they could help us diagnose these diseases .
so what is this ?
we &apos;re talking about god .
for the first time , we humans are playing the role of the Creator .
artificial intelligence is a very valuable and very important thing .
today , there are many famous scientists in Europe , America and Japan , and they have already performed these robot simulations for themselves .
these robots are quite cool and can represent them in a variety of situations .
this is what is happening ; this is not science fiction .
which doctor can best perform cancer diagnos@@ es in the United States today ?
it &apos;s not a human , as it is a robot , instead : IBM &apos;s W@@ AT@@ SON .
in the most famous cancer clinic of America , 85 % of final diagnos@@ es are made by W@@ AT@@ SON , Dr. Watson .
this is what is happening .
you have seen this movie and you all like Bay@@ max a lot .
if you want our opinion , the current Bay@@ max is still very stupid .
it has to ask you several questions in order to diagnose you depending on your answers .
but in fact , you don &apos;t need questions at all .
eventually there will be all kinds of sensors implanted in our bodies .
the future Bay@@ max , our health assistant , doesn &apos;t need to ask questions .
it can determine our problems with sensors .
this is what will happen in the future .
of course , in addition to the six technologies we just mentioned , 3D printing , cloning , nano technology , cell technology , genetics and artificial intelligence , there is a more thorough solution : the &quot; Av@@ atar Plan . &quot;
in addition to the Pentagon &apos;s Av@@ atar plan , there is actually a more famous plan which has been studied very thoroughly .
it is what a 20@@ 45 lab led by the Russian billionaire Iz@@ kov is doing .
we have seen the movie Av@@ atar .
from the movie , you can understand what kind of situation we are going to be living in .
we are going to live in a revolution@@ arily new way .
we are going to live in a virtual space that seems so real .
that is the future .
the leader of the 20@@ 45 Lab is the Russian billionaire Iz@@ kov .
there are 5000 top scientists in the world who want to work for him .
donations from countless rich guys around the world make it to him .
do you know why ?
it is because rich people are afraid of death .
of course , poor people are also afraid .
it is already very clear what he must do every five or ten years from 2015 to 20@@ 45 .
five years from now , something is going to happen .
what is it ?
a human in his lab will be able to control a robot a thousand kilometers away using just his natural brain consciousness .
what will happen after five years starting from 2020 ?
quite simply , when a natural human life comes to an end , the brain tissue of the deceased can be transplanted to a robot .
of course , such a brain should be maintained in its proper environment with the right nutrients and , of course , water .
this is the combination of man and machine .
what will happen after five years starting from 2030 ?
a very important thing will happen .
when a person dies , all of his brain consciousness , experiences , emotions , memories , etc. will be digi@@ tized , and then transferred .
but where will they go ?
maybe they will be transmitted to a USB drive , or perhaps to an external hard drive ; of course , we will eventually pass this data on to the cloud , a so @-@ called brain cloud , or the cloud cortex of our brain .
then , when this happens , it means that the entire consciousness of this person has been transferred to a machine , and this machine will survive forever as long as you provide it with enough energy .
of course , this is not the ultimate goal .
the ultimate goal is that by 20@@ 45 , the most exciting revolution will occur .
do you know what that is ?
that is , in the end , every human being will exist in the form of a three @-@ dimensional hol@@ ogram .
if humans can exist in a three @-@ dimensional hol@@ ographic way , is there still value for our current existence ?
will we need food ?
will we need sleep ?
will we need water ?
we will be able to walk through walls and move forward at the speed of light .
so it is thus not difficult for you to understand why Haw@@ king appeared in the Grand Theatre in Sydney some time ago , while he was actually in Cambridge .
of course , he was projected into the Sydney Grand Theatre in the form of a three @-@ dimensional hol@@ ogram .
he gave a very wonderful speech and there was a very lively interaction .
I think , in the future , of course , if Haw@@ king can catch up , if he can hold on , maybe he will exist in this world in the form of a three @-@ dimensional hol@@ ogram forever .
once human beings become 3D hol@@ o@@ grams , and once we can live forever , you will see that the earth is a very boring place , and you will find that the phrase that matters is not , &quot; the world is so big , I want to see it , &quot; but rather , &quot; the universe is very big , I want to see it . &quot;
NASA has been studying for 46 years , and it has now finally made a breakthrough .
they finally discovered that near the surface of the earth there was a time and space vortex .
do you understand what a &quot; time and space vortex &quot; is ?
who can explain this ?
a time and space vortex is very simple .
it is a wor@@ m@@ hole .
so what if we found a wor@@ m@@ hole ?
we could reach Mars and Saturn in an instant .
you might say , &quot; Mars is so hot , and Saturn is so cold , how could we survive ? &quot;
but when we are three @-@ dimensional hol@@ o@@ grams , we will not be afraid of heat or cold .
you see ?
so at that time you will find that human beings have the greatest amount of freedom , and our human civilization will have reached its highest level .
finally , everyone , let &apos;s hold out for 20@@ 46 .
let &apos;s witness the arrival of the most incredible and exciting moment in the history of human civilization .
thank you .
hello , there !
I would like to talk about literature today .
let &apos;s start with a novel Doctor Zhi@@ v@@ ago .
those who have seen its film adaptation may still recall the scene of Dr. Zhi@@ v@@ ago &apos;s death .
it was on a trolley bus .
Zhi@@ v@@ ago caught sight of a lady on the street , who looked very much like his lover Lar@@ a .
he thus rushed off the bus , only to fall to the ground , dead .
the dep@@ iction of this scene in the novel is different from that in the movie .
compare the two different media @-@ based versions and we can see an ingenious design made by the author P@@ aster@@ n@@ ak .
in the novel , Dr. Zhi@@ v@@ ago &apos;s death was like this .
it also happened on a trolley bus , which stopped and went due to some technical problems .
in the carriage , Zhi@@ v@@ ago felt suffoc@@ ated and had a chest pain . he tried to rush off the bus .
then he had a sudden heart attack and fell to the ground , dead .
there was indeed a lady in P@@ aster@@ n@@ ak &apos;s dep@@ iction .
it &apos;s just that she &apos;s not Lar@@ a , but a stranger .
the author immediately turned to a lengthy portr@@ ayal of this unknown lady .
this may seem very weird for ordinary readers .
after all , the protagon@@ ist was about to die , which was supposed to be shocking .
how come did the author take an abrupt turn ?
in his leng@@ thly and thorough dep@@ iction , she was a Swiss lady in lil@@ ac ; due to various coincid@@ ences , she was trapped in Russia , where she experienced twists and turns .
right then , she was still struggling for her destiny .
this sudden change to the dep@@ iction of a stranger seems very odd , creating a cold and non@@ chal@@ ant vi@@ be to the death scene .
that brings to my question for you today .
why did P@@ aster@@ n@@ ak design Dr. Zhi@@ v@@ ago &apos;s death that way ?
also , I would like to share with you my view on this novel .
for a long time , this novel was used as a weapon in the Cold War and both its lovers and hat@@ ers considered it a political novel .
decades later , when we review it once again from a literary and aesthetic perspective , we realize that it was not a weapon in the Cold War .
even Kh@@ r@@ ush@@ che@@ v recalled in his mem@@ oir years later that he hadn &apos;t read Doctor Zhi@@ v@@ ago .
had he done so , he wouldn &apos;t have launched a campaign against P@@ aster@@ n@@ ak .
I personally don &apos;t consider Doctor Zhi@@ v@@ ago a political novel nor a historical one , for P@@ aster@@ n@@ ak remained focused on the Mr. Nob@@ ody , namely , Zhi@@ v@@ ago throughout the novel .
despite the relentless advancement of time , readers have stayed in his inner world and his life .
we appreciate his gent@@ leness deep inside , his longing for love and his passion for beauty and poetry .
all such things as revolution , famine , internal war and migration were reduced to a background of this Mr. Nob@@ ody &apos;s mon@@ olog@@ ue .
in a sense , the novel is not an epic of a particular historical period , but a story about an individual .
our entire reading follows the life track of Dr. Zhi@@ v@@ ago .
yet , at the moment of Zhi@@ v@@ ago &apos;s death , P@@ aster@@ n@@ ak took an abrupt break and forcibly inserted a stranger &apos;s perspective .
through the view of that Swiss lady in lil@@ ac , we could bring Dr. Zhi@@ v@@ ago back to that cold world .
he seemed no more than a stranger falling to the roadside .
then coming into our view were that stop @-@ and @-@ go trolley bus , a crowded street , Moscow and even the entire Russia .
as we kept zo@@ oming out , Dr. Z@@ iv@@ ago became an increasingly dim dot .
this switch of perspective is actually quite interesting .
after all , as we read on , we became more and more related to Zhi@@ v@@ ago .
when we &quot; witnessed &quot; the scene through the view of the Swiss lady in lil@@ ac , we suddenly realized he couldn &apos;t be more common in the grand picture of history .
when walking through the crowd , the Swiss lady gave him a passing glance and said to herself , &quot; I don &apos;t know him , nor do I care about his death . &quot;
she then went straight ahead , &quot; quite unaware that she had overtaken Zhi@@ v@@ ago and survived him , &quot; added the author .
P@@ aster@@ n@@ ak &apos;s sympathy for this Mr. Nob@@ ody was thus revealed .
when seen in a bigger picture of history , Zhi@@ v@@ ago , having wea@@ thered vic@@ is@@ sit@@ udes , was no different from the lady in lil@@ ac , for both were passi@@ vely drawn into historical process , leaving nothing behind , not even their names .
this is my understanding of this novel , which had a disruptive impact on my established perception of novel writing .
in the mainstream system of Chinese literature , two gen@@ res are particularly valued for being grand and magnificent .
one is epic @-@ style narrative ; the other is native narrative .
they both feature lengthy and grand narrative in hundreds of thousands of words .
those works are deemed miniature of a certain historical period or a certain region .
with such reading experience , Chinese readers are prone to identify a contemporary man of letters as a certain region or period @-@ focused one .
strangely , we somehow seldom associate a writer with a particular character he or she created .
I mean , the name of a writer does not remind me of a particular character in his or her work .
Chinese writers tend to leave a vague impression that all characters they created just passi@@ vely and ap@@ a@@ thetically underwent various or@@ deals and lived on .
of those modern and contemporary Chinese literary works ( 100,000 words + ) , few focused on the dep@@ iction of an individual or was entitled their protagon@@ ist &apos;s name .
there may be a few exceptions , such as famous works Zhang Ju@@ zh@@ eng and Li Z@@ ich@@ eng , which came from their protagon@@ ists &quot; names .
it &apos;s just that the two protagon@@ ists were historical figures , i.e. Mr. Big , not Mr. Nob@@ ody .
in Russian writers &quot; works , however , there is no shortage of major works focusing on Mr. Nob@@ ody .
examples include Anna K@@ aren@@ ina , Doctor Zhi@@ v@@ ago and The Brothers Kar@@ amaz@@ ov .
they exposed a huge dilemma concerning history , religion or even life order through dep@@ iction of an individual or a family .
then it occurred to me my teacher of Chinese used to say a good literary piece is supposed to represent something bigger and prof@@ ounder .
under such guidance , we have been trained since little to conclude a challenge of times , historical problem or social phenomenon from a work .
this is also a representation of the &quot; seeing something bigger and prof@@ ounder from the small &quot; logic .
has it every occurred to you what exactly the &quot; small &quot; and the &quot; big &quot; refer to in this logic ?
based on my years of experience in texts &quot; central idea summarizing , I suppose the &quot; big &quot; includes history , society , era , the un@@ privileged majority , workers @-@ farmers @-@ soldiers combination , the entire humanity , etc . , etc .
anyway , they all feature an abstract or collective concept .
what does the &quot; small &quot; refer to ?
by contrast , it must refer to something specific and single , say , a flower , a weed , a view or a person .
in this &quot; seeing something bigger and prof@@ ounder from the small , &quot; the small is the means , while the big is the target .
that is to say , from a perspective of traditional Chinese literature , the dep@@ iction of an individual is to reflect certain historical or social problem .
this is what a good work is supposed to be like .
this view easily leaves the impression that the dep@@ iction of an individual for individual &apos;s sake is not justified in literature as it is shallow , small and valu@@ eless .
this view , through long @-@ term im@@ percep@@ tible influence , has resulted in undue depreciation of writers such as Zhang A@@ iling , whose works were considered individual @-@ focused , short @-@ sighted and of bourgeo@@ ise taste .
Zhang was excluded from the great writers list because she did not care much about national interest and politics .
some may argue that Zhang A@@ iling &apos;s literary status has now improved a lot .
this actually reminds me of another renowned female writer of her time , Ding Ling .
Ding belonged to the League of the Left @-@ Wing Writ@@ ers , who were critical of Zhang &apos;s style of writing .
besides , Ding also actively embraced politics .
Ding was the author of The Sun Sh@@ ines over the S@@ ang@@ gan River , an influential novel about land reform .
yes , it is familiar to all .
in fact , Zhang A@@ iling also tried the same topic , which , I &apos;m afraid , is not known to many .
two of Zhang &apos;s novels , i.e. N@@ aked Earth and The Rice Spr@@ out Song : a Nov@@ el of Modern China also touched upon the political issue of land reform .
who &apos;s better at the same political topic ? was it Ding Ling , who embraced and threw herself into politics , or Zhang A@@ iling , who remained non@@ chal@@ ant to and dis@@ engaged from it .
with the el@@ apse of time , the answer has become increasingly clear , whether it &apos;s from an aesthetic or politically @-@ correct perspective .
one must wonder how come Zhang , who had little interest in politics , chose to write about land reform .
she actually had a profound understanding of and compassion for human nature , although Zhang may leave readers the impression of being t@@ art and mean .
for example , in her work N@@ aked Earth , a landlord &apos;s wife in the late pregnancy was stripped naked and hanged to death .
Zhang &apos;s usual approach to dep@@ iction was calm and restrained .
but she made an exception by asking , &quot; how can human dignity be retained when they are treated like livestock ? &quot;
in her dep@@ iction , when the arrested landlord was about to be executed , he knelt down in the wind , trembling .
Zhang then commented , &quot; the tremble and the fresh pain brought by the cold wind , will disappear with his life . &quot;
such a sigh showed a compassion for life .
it was her profound understanding of human nature that kept her away from any grand political belief or party and enabled her to see something going wrong .
after all , basic human rights were not guaranteed .
upon returning from the countryside , Zhang quickly made an excuse and left China &apos;s mainland .
her rest life is known to all , for which I will skip it .
speaking of the improvement of Zhang &apos;s literary status , Mr. H@@ sia Chi@@ h @-@ t@@ sing &apos;s contributions cannot go unnoticed .
as a scholar , H@@ sia spoke highly of Zhang A@@ iling .
according to him , Zhang was among the most distinguished and important writers of contemporary China , the Golden c@@ ang@@ ue is the best @-@ ever novel@@ ette of China and The Rice Spr@@ out Song a masterpiece in the history of Chinese fiction .
H@@ sia Chi@@ h @-@ t@@ sing re @-@ evaluated not just Zhang A@@ iling , but also Zhang Ti@@ any@@ i , Shen Con@@ g@@ wen and others .
H@@ sia &apos;s supporters admire him for his re@@ writing of the history of modern Chinese fiction .
I like his book A History of Modern Chinese F@@ iction , which I think is an attack against the Lef@@ tist literary standard .
H@@ sia had been consistent in his view of literature , calling for a return to literature itself and a return to human .
such a view may be applied to re @-@ evaluating the two gen@@ res we mentioned just now , namely , epic @-@ style narrative and native narrative .
the purpose of native narrative is not to showcase local customs and practices but to unveil human relationships .
in a time , I liked such works very much and was impressed by their slow proceeding , which formed a barrier to smooth reading .
the author gradually unfolded a story as if it was the scroll of River@@ side Sc@@ ene at Qing@@ ming Festival .
with more trees , pav@@ ili@@ ons , views and characters emerging , the story became more vivid .
this genre features a long and redundant beginning .
I used to think it an inevitable defect until I read T@@ ales of H@@ ul@@ an River by famous writer Xiao Hong .
this novel also falls into native narrative .
she began the story at a crossroads in a little town and dar@@ ingly gave a 3,000 @-@ word dep@@ iction of a mud pit there .
while reading , I was totally attracted by it and felt anything but redundant .
when I became a novelist later , I did some research in her writing magic that made the lengthy dep@@ iction of a pit so attractive ？
I discovered that she injected human feelings into her dep@@ iction .
sometimes , a heavy rain could flood the pit ; while a dry season could shrink it .
horses frequently fell into it .
pigs got drowned there .
and water over@@ flowing it ruined a wall nearby and destroyed houses .
revolving around the mud pit , the surrounding residents &quot; life and relationships were thus presented .
yes , her writing magic lies in the target &apos;s interaction with people .
without such an interaction , the dep@@ iction of a view or local landscape would reduce to static piling of dull words .
once related to human nature and feelings , the dep@@ iction becomes vivid and charming .
no wonder Mr. H@@ sia Chi@@ h @-@ t@@ sing also spoke highly of Xiao Hong .
he said that Xiao was a great writer and that she was even more gifted than Mao D@@ un , although Mao wrote a preface to her T@@ ales of H@@ ul@@ an River .
that &apos;s his comment .
in short , speaking of returning to literature , we must be well aware that literature is essentially about science of man .
I know it sounds cor@@ ny .
but we never take it seriously enough and seldom think about its exact meaning .
does it refer to an individual or a collective term ?
we or I ?
a single person or a group ?
at the Yan &apos;an Forum on Literature and Art of 19@@ 42 , Mao Zedong gave his famous speeches , arguing that art and literature should serve workers , farmers and soldiers and should also serve politics .
Mao &apos;s speeches triggered numerous reflections , analyses and disputes later on .
in fact , their core idea has had a profound impact on Chinese readers .
we have been told literature should serve the grass @-@ roots group , namely , workers , farmers and soldiers , and should reflect major historical and social issues .
this is another way of saying literature should serve politics .
individuals must be integrated into a group and be associated with a grand and abstract concept .
otherwise , literature is considered meaningless .
maybe we can examine this concept the other way round .
history is a temporal concept , while geography is a spatial one .
and man is precisely at the intersection of time and space .
should humans go extinct , history and geography would lose their meaning .
neither mountains nor rivers have consciousness .
their significance is all given by man .
without humans , time would be an empty concept and el@@ ap@@ ses meaning@@ lessly .
it is human existence that makes history and geography meaningful .
by placing man at the most important position , we come up with a reversed logic of literature .
I mean the purpose of writing is not to reflect history or society , but to highlight the importance of an individual .
individuals are part of social life , which is part of an era , which is part of history .
thus , the ultimate target is man , not history .
this is my rough view on literature .
one of my favorite writers is Joseph Bro@@ d@@ sky , an exiled Russian writer who hadn &apos;t received much education .
later , he shaped his views of literature , world outlook and values through self @-@ study .
he used to say his pursuit of writing could be simply summarized as &quot; spirit of individualism . &quot;
I really like it .
thank you all !
what Qing@@ xiang said really made me think a lot .
I feel that it reminds me of a voice that I often used seven or eight years ago but now is lost to me .
it was an approach of expression , full of intense emotions , delivered in a collective and excited way .
of course , I believe every generation is different .
and we two are not much different in age , about four or five years .
but we &apos;re like two water@@ sheds .
so why does he make me to remind you of this ?
I think maybe every generation has the desire to exaggerate its own importance , and even to exaggerate its in@@ competence and suffering .
every generation lives in a sense of emptiness where the old world has perished , but the new world has yet to be built , as described by Matthew Arnold .
this kind of feeling persists for a century , reflected in the new cultural movement mentioned earlier by Mr. Ma Yong , in the anger and cry of Chinese college students in the 1980s , and in the sorrow of the people born in the 1980s .
what is consistent throughout the twentieth century , you will find , is the individual consciousness that has yet to be awakened .
young people in the 19@@ 20s wanted to break free from family ethics and social pressures , like Nor@@ a wants to run away from the Dol@@ l &apos;s House , but what can they do after that ?
I never thought that nearly a hundred years later , a new generation of young people still feel that they are under control , and they cannot really develop their personal art .
I think it may be a huge sorrow for several generations of intellectuals including us who are talking about this issue today .
it seems as if we have fallen into a heart @-@ w@@ ren@@ ching vicious circle of history .
every generation often does not even know that they are trapped in the predicament of history .
they think that they have entered a new era and suffered new pains , but all the pains are no more than relics and remains from the past .
enough with the dig@@ res@@ sion .
let &apos;s come back to what I am going to talk about today , which are the episodes during my trips over the past few years .
one of them was my first trip to Vietnam in 2005 .
I took a mini@@ bus in Guangxi and traveled through the narrow northern tip of Vietnam , which is shaped like a shoulder pole , to Han@@ oi .
Vietnam was going through new political and economic changes at that time , so I wondered what the country would look like .
then in Han@@ oi I met with the Vietnamese female writer in the cafe opposite to the hotel where Graham Green wrote Qui@@ et American .
I have forgotten her name because it &apos;s hard to pronounce .
she is probably known as Wei Hui of Vietnam , manife@@ sting younger generation &apos;s bold opinions on sex , social changes and politics in Vietnam .
she is very gentle and gracious .
we talk about the relationship between China and Vietnam with the help of an interpreter .
she proposed a very interesting idea that I had never thought about before .
she said that in Vietnamese literature , especially in the love stories , the mighty hero coming from the north is often Chinese , and the heroine , often Vietnamese , was al@@ way in distress , cap@@ iti@@ v@@ ated or had to please the man .
this example astonished me .
because in the literary works that we often saw from the era of the early twentieth century to the time of Wei Hui , the powerful male image was always wester@@ ners from Europe or the United States , while Chinese women were pictured as weak , trying to please others .
but in Vietnam , it &apos;s a different case .
we represented a new kind of intr@@ ud@@ ers or a powerful image .
you will definitely see Confucius Tem@@ ples in Han@@ oi .
Confucius has a deep influence in Vietnam .
the image of Confucius there is of course Vietnamese , not the image of the Shandong people we are familiar with or the images from other places .
you can always see the records of how China invaded Vietnam in their history books .
this is the first example .
at that time I was less than 30 and I clearly realized for the first time that for the surrounding small countries , China represents a different image from what I thought it would be , very different .
the second example was my trip to Myanmar about two years ago .
Myanmar was undergoing tremendous changes .
the N@@ LD led by A@@ ung San Su@@ u K@@ yi started their election campaign , and the society began to loosen .
then we witnessed the dramatic change of Myanmar , which transformed from a long @-@ time dict@@ atorial and sleeping society to a less fearful and fre@@ er one .
another thing local Myan@@ m@@ ese will talk about is the so @-@ called Chinese Ex@@ pedi@@ tionary Force , which is also an example we will easily recall when we go to Myanmar .
they opened up new battle@@ fields in Myanmar .
they were important forces in World War II but they were tragic .
eventually they seemed to be abandoned .
but many people in Myanmar told me that they were filled with some kind of anger that could not be expressed to the so @-@ called Chinese Ex@@ pedi@@ tionary Force .
because the Chinese Ex@@ pedi@@ tionary Force was an invading army in their mind .
they had long been ruled by British colon@@ ists , and with the arrival of the Japanese , they had completed a new alliance with Japan .
the so @-@ called General A@@ ung San , A@@ ung San Su@@ u K@@ yi &apos;s father , was in a very close relationship with the Japanese .
they wanted to unite to drive away the British colon@@ ists .
the arrival of the Chinese army was thought to be an invasion from the north .
also because of the failure of the Chinese Civil War , a large number of Kuomintang troops were stranded in the northern part of Myanmar .
we now know the so @-@ called drug traffickers as well as military regimes in the Golden Tri@@ angle .
they believe that the existence of the Kuomintang army had made it impossible for Myanmar to complete the process of national independence and national unity .
it also became a strong excuse for them , making the military government rule the country in a long term .
this is the second point .
it suddenly comes to my mind that the image of China that we are familiar with , the army that you think is tragic or victorious , is an intr@@ uder in their eyes , an obstruc@@ tor of their national unity .
the third example was a trip to Singapore in October .
Singapore has somewhat hard feelings towards China , due to whatever reason or their own narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness , not only to Chinese tourists but also to the whole China .
they laugh at the so @-@ called new Chinese tourists who buy everything , behave rud@@ ely , spit everywhere , and whose children are noisy .
such an image becomes part of their daily life , which makes me very uncomfortable .
but at the same time , you feel that people in such a remote and small country have a huge anxiety about China &apos;s rise , and we are unaware of it .
and I find something very interesting when I looked at Lee K@@ uan Y@@ ew &apos;s mem@@ o@@ irs .
in 1978 , when China just started reform and opening up , Mr.@@ Deng Xiaoping paid a visit to Lee K@@ uan Y@@ ew .
Deng Xiaoping was looking forward to forming a new alliance with Singapore to fight against the expansion of the Soviet Union , which was significant for the entire Asia .
but to his surprise , the meeting with Lee K@@ uan Y@@ ew was completely different from what he expected .
Lee K@@ uan Y@@ ew said , &quot; what we are most concerned and worried about in the entire Southeast Asia is the Communist forces of Myanmar and Malaysia , which are supported by China .
it is these communist forces of Southeast Asia that make these countries be caught in constant turmoil . &quot;
it is these words that made Deng Xiaoping rethink the relationship between China and the outside world .
I think few people still remember this , but it fully indicates how insensitive we Chinese were to what the outside world think of us .
and we are still insensitive today .
with the strong in@@ sensibility towards the world , China now is undergoing rapid economic growth and great social changes , and we have exported this great power to many places .
in Africa , we have a lot of investment and immigrants ; in Latin America , we have bought mines and built new canals ; and we are everywhere in Southeast Asia .
but we seldom consider what damage we will bring to the world with our lifestyles , our value standard , the principles we stick to , or the principle that we have no principle .
young people of your generation nowadays traveled extensively around the world , many may think that you are embracing globalization ; but ac@@ turally China knows little about the outside world , and even insensitive to it .
and this feeling is what the writer Bo Yang has described in the book that I want to talk about today .
in 1985 , he published his little book of prose entitled &quot; The Ug@@ ly Chin@@ aman &quot; simultaneously in Taiwan and on the mainland .
Bo Yang was a very important prose writer in the 20th century .
he went to Taiwan with the Kuomintang army in 1949 and he was a sati@@ rist .
he once translated an interesting comic book &quot; The Pop@@ eye &quot; in which there is a story about a father and son trying to run for president on the island .
this was a very funny cartoon , and Bo Yang translated one of its lines into &quot; all compatriots , how do we run for president . &quot;
it was an expression that Chiang Kai @-@ she@@ k liked to use most at the time .
this translation was regarded as a symbol of Chiang Kai @-@ she@@ k and Chiang Ching @-@ k@@ uo &apos;s dictatorship in Taiwan .
he was thus put in prison and spent nearly a decade on Green Island .
after he was released , he continued being a sati@@ rist like before .
then in 1982 and 1983 , he gave several lectures at Tun@@ g@@ hai University in Taiwan and the University of Iowa in the United States .
the topics were all about The Ug@@ ly Chin@@ aman .
people will feel nothing strange or special when we re @-@ read it now .
it describes the absence of public order , social morality , sense of solidarity and public spirit in Chinese people &apos;s lives , which remains in today &apos;s Chinese society .
but when he expressed the idea , he followed the style originated from the &quot; ugly &quot; series popular in the United States and Japan at that time , include the Ug@@ ly Americans and Ug@@ ly Japanese .
the Ug@@ ly Chin@@ aman written by him is consistent with the spirit of self @-@ criticism in Chinese tradition .
Bo Yang just followed L@@ un Xun &apos;s footsteps to explore Chinese nationality .
but this book caused a huge shock in China in the 1980s , which was related to the overall social sentiment at the time .
in the 1980s after the huge turmoil of Cultural Revolution , we suddenly found that after a 30 @-@ year social experiment , everything in China had become even more backward .
therefore , a strong self @-@ criticism perme@@ ated throughout the 1980s .
the Ug@@ ly Chin@@ aman and the TV seri@@ als River E@@ leg@@ y three years later both conveyed such a spirit .
Chinese intellectuals , especially young people at the time were eager to know what happened in this country , what happened in the superficial political system as well as the deep cultural structure .
this book was of the most striking extension of that sentiment at that time .
but this kind of inquiry came to an abrupt end after 1989 because we entered a new era .
it is an era of rapid economic growth , an economy @-@ centered era .
other social strengths , such as ethical and cultural values Qing@@ xiang just mentioned are suppressed and underestimated in a sense .
we are now entering such a new era .
when I read this book again thirty years later , I was very surprised to find everything that Bo Yang describes , everything that Sun Y@@ at@@ sen and Liang Q@@ ic@@ hao had complained about , is still going on in current society .
and since China is emerging as a new and powerful force in the world , all the defects he complains about are brought to the rest of the world , appearing in a new way with obvious arrogance .
Bo Yang likes to make an analogy in his book , comparing Chinese culture to a huge sauce jar .
we live in it and we are constantly polluted by it .
I think in essence , his &quot; sauce jar &quot; refers to China &apos;s long @-@ standing authoritarian culture in the traditional sense .
it re@@ presses the growth of personality and the growth of personal spirit , and this repression still at this moment , continues .
but the new sauce jar we see sometimes look like a gold @-@ plated sauce jar because of the advent of the gil@@ ded age and the great power of money .
the most dangerous thing is that living in the gold @-@ plated sauce jar , we become more content with what we are doing and more convinced that it is reasonable .
it &apos;s another kind of arrogance .
the ugly Chin@@ aman in the 1980s tended to be more defensive , because the long @-@ term turmoil and social disruption caused a certain will to live , a huge defensive panic .
but at this moment , many people turn to be more offensive and less intro@@ spective in the new gold @-@ plated sauce jar .
Southeast Asian people &apos;s feeling about China and their understanding of China &apos;s image , which I talked about earlier , are all extension of Chinese people &apos;s characteristics that have been re @-@ expanded .
so for our generation and your generation , perhaps the most important mission is to re @-@ understand the relationship between China and the world , and to create a new understanding of ourselves in this process .
I find that from the time of Bo Yang to the present , one of the most dramatic changes in China is that the voice of self @-@ reflection and self @-@ criticism within the s@@ os@@ i@@ ety has gradually faded .
instead , there comes out a very noisy voice of self @-@ forgiveness and self @-@ satis@@ fication .
and there is no re @-@ involvement of the relationship between China and the world at this moment .
in my view , China &apos;s influence on the world , at this moment , is more of a hype than a real impact on values .
hello , everyone !
in such an era of the Internet , especially advanced mobile Internet , we can first look back into history when it comes to the future .
this picture shows from about 2,000 ago to 200 years ago , how we human transported goods : through wooden boat , wheel@@ bar@@ row , carriage or even camel .
but now we use containers , airplanes , automobiles and even U@@ AV@@ s to send express deliveries and supplies to deal with problems in logistics .
2,000 years ago , horses were our &quot; messengers . &quot;
until 200 years ago , telegram was invented to send and receive information .
however , in the Internet Age , conveying information is such an easy thing through We@@ Chat or mobile phones conveniently .
telegram office was a past thing .
about 2,000 years ago , roughly the Spring and Autumn Period and the War@@ ring States Period , capital flew in such a way , called &quot; knife money . &quot;
so what are holes on them for ?
such &quot; money &quot; can be strung together , then tied to people &apos;s wai@@ sts .
but now we can use Ali@@ pay or bank cards to realize capital flow .
to be noted , Jack Ma , demonstrated in Han@@ over last month the new &quot; S@@ mile to Pay . &quot;
it occurs to me that whether it is possible to become Jack Ma through plastic surgery so that we could spend his money .
but personally , I don &apos;t want to spend his money at the price of becoming like him through plastic surgery .
this picture shows 2,000 years ago , the teaching method of Confucius .
look , Confucius is behind the platform , and his 72 disciples are listening .
2,000 years later , in today &apos;s Internet Age , it is a typical scene of school teaching .
you will find that , in the financial industry , the way of information delivery , or logistics in recent decades or hundreds of years , has witnessed enormous changes comparing to that of 2,000 years ago .
but only how we teach and convey knowledge seems to remain basically unchanged .
why ?
are our educators not innovative enough ?
I myself have engaged in the education industry for nearly 20 years .
personally , the answer is &quot; Yes &quot; to a large extent .
our education industry , or many of our educators , is really not bold enough to innovate .
in the Internet age , we may pay for it .
at what expense ?
I think the price may be that universities will disappear in the near future , or universities in the traditional sense , will be completely transformed .
so what will teaching scenarios be in the era of mobile Internet ?
in my opinion , the way in a designated time , at a designated space , to learn from the designated person on a designated topic will be no longer in existence .
here are several circumstances .
firstly , more frequently , especially in IT industry I have been engaged in , students often surpass teachers .
software or IT industry , will generally welcome a a new language every few months .
a diligent student can easily get access to the knowledge he needs through the Internet , mobile Internet and various digital tools .
hence teachers and students in the campus have increasingly narrow gap actually .
a teacher who is not diligent enough will surely be surpassed by a diligent student , especially in the field of IT .
an acad@@ em@@ ician with rich workshop experience rather than further study for 3 years cannot match a lecturer , and similarly , a lecturer without studying for 3 years is second to a student .
more frequent cases have proved blurred boundaries between students and teachers .
another thing is that our diplom@@ as or educational backgrounds are of less importance to employers or enterprises .
I remember when I started my own software company over a decade ago .
my technical director and backbone technicians were basically all graduates of famous universities such as Jia@@ ot@@ ong University or F@@ ud@@ an University .
almost all of them .
B@@ UR nowadays , in my own company or around me .
the fact is that technical leaders are not only school@@ fellows of a few prestigious universities .
instead , they may come from little known universities or even are not undergraduate students .
but they can still be responsible for very important posts and very difficult technical work .
this is the second thing happening around us .
therefore , I wonder if universities will really disappear .
is it highly necessary to have universities ?
comparing to department stores around us , I think universities actually follow a traditional B@@ 2@@ C model , just like department stores at such as Nanjing Road and Hu@@ ai@@ hai Road .
students pay to universities for knowledge conveyance service , and universities are much like a wholes@@ aler who gather professors and lectu@@ rers together then &quot; retail &quot; to students .
exactly a traditional B@@ 2@@ C model as I said .
last month , I was invited to give a speech at the Open University of Henan in Zheng@@ zhou .
I remember that more than a decade ago , an advertisement always on CCTV said : &quot; where to enjoy shopping best ? Asia in Zheng@@ zhou is your best choice ! &quot;
&quot; Asia &quot; was the name of a huge shopping mall .
after arriving at Zheng@@ zhou , I asked &quot; Is the shopping mall still there ? &quot;
the answer was that &quot; It didn &apos;t exist a few years ago . &quot;
similar cases actually happened for many times , and now malls are far more meaningful in terms of experience rather than shopping .
friends in schools , job and daily life can go there out of unique atmosphere or stronger friendship .
exactly the same way of our colleges , especially business schools .
the glory of passing on knowledge now gradually makes way for diversified experience of even friendship or business match@@ making .
thus the way of conveying knowledge in the Internet Age will rely more on the means of the Internet and self @-@ study .
here is a hot topic in recent years , MO@@ OC .
as far as I know , an MIT professor who could only teach 400 students in class .
in the last year , gave lessons to about 16@@ 0,000 students through the Internet .
he pointed out different experience between online and offline lessons , with better results in a sense .
for example , traditionally , you should learn specified content in a given time , but it is not the rule through the Internet .
you can review or view the video when you have time , re@@ play or even choose to watch any part of the content as you wish .
perhaps in some ways , it is not as detailed as face @-@ to @-@ face teaching .
but its technical features can make up for the shortcomings we are not accustomed to .
as a result , future higher education is more likely to realize through the Internet or other digital ways plus some forums and lectures .
if we interpret from the perspective of mobile web , it is actually a O@@ 2@@ O learning model , namely , online plus offline learning .
assuming that a platform or any popular digital way that enables everyone to be a teacher and a learner .
then such learning eventually evol@@ ves into a P@@ 2@@ P model .
the traditional B@@ 2@@ C model will certainly be replaced by teaching models such as O@@ 2@@ O and P@@ 2@@ P little by little .
we also need to get used to such a process gradually .
I made some attempts on my own .
early last year , as I served as a part @-@ time professor at Shanghai Ocean University for several years .
I opened a course called &quot; Introduction to Cloud Compu@@ ting . &quot;
then out of the idea of teaching through cloud computing ,
I developed a system since I started from software development .
in this system , every question of and every click by students could be observed and recorded .
more specifically , when did a student learn the course ?
in which district of Shanghai ?
during daytime or at night ?
all the learning processes would be recorded and known by the teacher .
here are some real @-@ time data .
it occurs to me that , if talking about no necessity of universities is much of exaggeration , changing the role of diploma is an imminent issue .
for what reasons ?
because as we collected immense data , just imaging , is diploma of great use to an HR ?
do you know how many universities are in China ?
according to my search , China has more than 2,000 universities and over 7 million graduates every year .
what &apos;s this ?
twenty yuan , right ?
and what can I do with twenty yuan ?
a lot of things .
however , I can tell you , it equals to the fee to register attendance on behalf of another student in universities .
it &apos;s a standard level of charge .
twenty yuan means one registration .
Oh , it is weird and quite shocking to me .
it reminds me more than 20 years ago , when I was studying at Jia@@ ot@@ ong University , we presented a petition to school leaders .
for what ?
we demanded not to turn off the lights too early at eleven o &apos;clock in the evening and we wanted to study all night , so that we had such a petition .
but now college students will choose to pay 20 yuan rather than attend classes by themselves .
I often discuss it with my colleagues that why do students behave in such way ?
someone answered : &quot; because they want to sleep during the day . &quot;
I wondered why they sleep during the day .
then replied that &quot; Because they play games at night . &quot;
it &apos;s terrible indeed .
but what &apos;s worse ？
those who spent 20 yuan asking others to attend classes instead are not necessarily less successful than his classmates who attend the class regularly .
it is more terrible .
what does it mean ?
it shows that in the university , the classes might not offer students enough useful knowledge .
this is the education aiming for a diploma , and many of us study out of this reason .
among over 2,000 universities I mentioned earlier .
I estimate that more than 80 % also aim merely for diploma education as they provide it .
but what is the essence of a diploma ?
it is essentially generated by the age of information asym@@ metry .
for instance , because I don &apos;t know you and your ability as well , so I would rather believe this diploma .
you graduated from a certain university .
you had four years of undergraduate education or graduate education ,
all depend on a piece of paper to prove your ability .
because I don &apos;t have enough time or enough data to know more about you .
in that way , we can say diploma is the product of information asym@@ metry era .
however , in the next five years , maybe ten years , maybe at most one or two decades .
as Internet teaching , mobile learning , ubiquitous learning and big data in education develop or become highly available .
then every education experience , every exam , every question that be handled , every project and how well each project do can be all recorded .
when an HR faces such data and a diploma , what will win more favors ?
so I think that as the Internet is more involved in every aspect of our daily life more rapidly , diplom@@ as will become increasingly meaningless .
furthermore , offering diplom@@ as is the only purpose for many universities in China .
maybe 70 % or 80 % of them hold that purpose , which will be greatly challenged or finally disappear in the next one or two decades .
as for teachers in some universities or even in famous ones .
if you are not open or hard enough and not able to master Internet learning , may encounter same challenges as well .
so that we can further predict future .
secondary schools may become more important than universities , and maybe someday elementary schools will outri@@ vals in importance .
at that time , professors , acad@@ em@@ icians or masters will be no longer mysterious figures as information asym@@ metry is further broken .
in fact , I personally think that many masters gained such fame because of information asym@@ metry .
only a selected few have unique abilities beyond ordinary people .
how about famous schools , especially those like Tsinghua University , Peking University , Jia@@ ot@@ ong University and F@@ ud@@ an University ?
they may evolve into research @-@ oriented universities , or research institutions in the name of universities , whose teaching functions will be increasingly weakened .
then what kind of universities can survive ?
the answer must be those with an open and ready mind to welcome the Internet Age and with teachers of young mentality .
an little known university may rise to be a star ; a diligent but unknown teacher becomes a hit .
now back to the question why do we need to learn ?
maybe in another 50 or 100 years , it will become very simple .
why ?
we should learn because knowledge cannot be inherited .
imagine that if knowledge can be inherited , we may not need to learn .
will it become true ?
I think it &apos;s possible .
of course , maybe one day when our brains can be implanted with a chip , knowledge then can be inherited .
then schools will be greatly divergent from what they are now .
totally different .
lots of them will no longer exist .
so what should we do at that time ?
in my opinion , knowledge may be inherited and copied , but our personality , emotions , love and humanity , all of which makes us human , will become more and more significant .
thus , such an era is just around the corner .
be a man of distinct character , be a man of strong will , be yourself .
that might be the future of our education .
thank you !
hi , everyone !
I am very happy to be here today and I feel much honored to have this opportunity to talk to you about &quot; science and beauty . &quot;
it does not mean the science of beautiful women , although it does involve a discussion on beauty .
after all , the science of beauty would not be truly scientific if it fails to explain the beauty of women , so we have to get it right .
so today , I would like to share two things with you : the first is the science of beauty , which is the science inside the beauty ; the second point is the beauty of science .
to me November 25th is the day of greatest beauty .
why ?
there are two reasons .
the first reason is that a hundred years ago , on this very day , Einstein published his theory of general relativity , which is the most beautiful science theory to me .
another reason is , as you can see , 25 years ago , my daughter , the most beautiful girl in the world was born .
what is the common@@ ality between the beauty of my daughter and the beauty of the theory of general relativity ?
what is scientific about them ?
this is the first point I want to make today .
in other words , the question we are asking is what is beauty ?
this is a question that has been pursued by philosophers for more than two thousand years , from the great philosopher Socrates to his student Plato , and Plato &apos;s student Aristotle , on to Kant and H@@ egel , etc .
it is called the Gen@@ i@@ uses &apos; Dou@@ b@@ t .
so let &apos;s see what the modern answer to this millennium @-@ old question is .
of course , there exist multiple answers .
let &apos;s take the answer by aesthetics experts summarized by Professor Zhu Li@@ yuan of F@@ ud@@ an University as an example .
professor Zhu thought that he finds it hard to give a personal answer , but as Plato has said : what &apos;s Beautiful is Di@@ ffic@@ ult , he would think the same .
moreover , Professor Zhu added that he felt that this saying is words of wisdom .
what &apos;s Beautiful is indeed Di@@ ffic@@ ult .
personally , I would like to say that What &apos;s Beautiful is Fem@@ ale .
suppose we are in a classroom , when I was lec@@ turing , Xiao &apos;an or An Xia@@ ox@@ ue , one of the audience today , asked one question , &quot; Dear professor , how high is the sun ? &quot;
since I am a professor of astronomy , this is considered an appropriate question .
I would reply : &quot; my dear , how real am I ! &quot;
Xiao &apos;an goes on to ask , &quot; How many stars are there up in the sky ? &quot;
again , I would reply : &quot; there are millions and millions of them . &quot;
this situation may remind you of a song by a beautiful singer Yang Yu@@ ying telling a similar story .
if I keep answering her questions in this manner , Xiao &apos;an will definitely feel very frustrated .
these are some typical examples of irrelevant answers .
in my opinion , &quot; What &apos;s Beautiful is Di@@ ffic@@ ult &quot; is an example of irrelevant answers .
what is Beauty ?
&quot; what &apos;s Beautiful is Di@@ ffic@@ ult &quot;
I am not sure how you perceive this pair of question and answer , but I myself find it problematic .
why ?
because this is not scientific .
in what way ?
avoiding the question is not our way .
as scientists , we find out the underlying cause of it and we answer it right to the point .
therefore , what do I think of this question ?
in fact , I have been thinking about it for nearly 30 years .
I want to do aesthetics in a scientific way .
the famous physicist , Mr. Peng H@@ eng@@ wu , once said , &quot; Although the physical world is ever changing , it is very sincere . the same phenomena will always occur under the same conditions . &quot;
I believe the same goes for aesthetics .
I believe that although the world of beauty is ever changing , for example , we have beauty of all kinds present today ; it is by no means without any rule .
then , if I were to answer the question , I will start with the question itself first .
Einstein not only taught us what general relativity is , but also the scientific way to do research .
he said that coming up with a good question is far more meaningful than solving several problems .
so what is beauty ?
I think this question needs to be re@@ wor@@ ded .
I think it can be re@@ wor@@ ded as what makes an aesthetic object , which may refer to human , scenery , cuisine , art and science , beautiful to us ?
in other words , what is the criterion of beauty in a general sense ?
this question is re@@ phr@@ ased .
in this was , if the criterion of beauty in a general sense can be established , then we would be able to understand &quot; what is beauty &quot; or &quot; the essence of beauty . &quot;
of course , a more academic way to put &quot; the criterion of beauty in a general sense &quot; would be , in my words , &quot; the law of beauty in a general sense , &quot; as I intend to establish a law of beauty in a general sense .
so what are the specific steps ?
I adopt syl@@ log@@ ism , the default practice in natural science research .
as for the research procedures , there are three specific stages .
first , we induce .
we compare different types of beauty and find out what is common among them .
then we testify .
that is to say , we accumulate more examples , and examine as many examples as possible to testify the reliability of the common law we have established .
if some examples are against this law , we need to adjust it accordingly .
next , we falsi@@ fy .
we try to find out a coun@@ te@@ re@@ x@@ ample , something that is beautiful but is against this common law .
in this way , I arrived at the law of beauty in the general sense .
the law can be defined as &quot; flaw@@ less and uncommon . &quot;
objects with these two qualities are thought to be beautiful .
&quot; flaw@@ less &quot; refers to its value .
qualities such as being powerful , natural , reasonable , intact , authentic and kind .
&quot; uncommon &quot; refers to properties such as being peculiar , exotic , excellent and pos@@ h while &quot; common &quot; refers to qualities such as being un@@ sophisticated , raw , fake and so on .
gentlemen , I strongly suggest you avoiding these &quot; common &quot; items on my list when dep@@ icting your girlfriend or wife , you might get killed or strang@@ led for this .
therefore , the key to judge what is beauty lies in this .
what is aesthetic qu@@ oti@@ ent ?
why do we develop divergent aesthetics qu@@ oti@@ ents ?
aesthetics qu@@ oti@@ ent is the ability to judge beauty , to determine whether an object is flaw@@ less on a value level and whether it is uncommon through our experience .
therefore , differences in our values and experiences lead to divergent aesthetics orient@@ ations .
those who find a object or person flaw@@ less and uncommon will see beauty in it .
you experience beauty when you find something flaw@@ less and uncommon .
beauty van@@ ishes when you begin to feel the opposite .
therefore , there is no beauty , which is objective , universally applicable and eternal .
beauty is ever changing .
here is another example .
these are some pictures that I posted on my We@@ Chat Mom@@ ents yesterday .
as we all know , the sky in Beijing has been very clear for the past few days .
many have posted pictures of blue sky and white clouds .
yesterday I posted several pictures of the morning glow and the white clouds .
and I commented &quot; Why bright as the morning glow , clear as the blue sky , fewer will be amazed by this scenery again ? &quot;
this is because the blue sky and white clouds have been the norm for a while , although they are still flaw@@ less , they are no longer uncommon anymore , so people cease to find them beautiful .
therefore , I went to say , &quot; Smo@@ g ! tell me gently when will you come back from your vacation ? &quot;
I asked such a question .
one of my friends commented jo@@ kingly : &quot; if your post were seen by a scientist , you might be misunderstood as verifying your aesthetic theory at the cost of the health of the general public . &quot;
I quickly replied that I did not mean it that way .
I added , desperate to get my point across , that I prefer the &quot; not so uncommon &quot; blue sky and I would never want anyone to suffer from smog issues .
another friend &apos;s comment is even more surprising .
he said , &quot; The smog has been away for quite a few days , I miss it already . so how is the weather today ? &quot;
so that is what happens when you keep a &quot; bad &quot; companion .
and here is a further example .
this example is about Prof. He Ze@@ hui , my mentor .
together with the autumn scenery in Tsinghua Park , she stands as the epit@@ ome of beauty to me .
this is what I posted on my We@@ Chat Mom@@ ents on November 2@@ 2nd .
two events happened on that day .
the first was a meeting at Tsinghua University in commemoration of the 6@@ 9th anniversary of the publication of Prof. He Ze@@ hui &apos;s outstanding research work .
but Prof. He passed away a few years ago .
please look at this photo on the left side of the screen . the little girl in it was Prof .
he in her younger years .
obviously a real beauty .
on the right side is a picture of her in the later years .
we can see she was still glorious .
therefore , to me Prof. He is the epit@@ ome of brilliance , beauty and morality .
such a beauty is the ultimate beauty .
the autumn scenery in Tsinghua Park is breath @-@ taking and flaw@@ less ; it is right in its prime .
and this kind of beauty usually resides in a natural environment .
the snow scene is beautiful , especially the first snow .
on that very day , Beijing had a heavy snow@@ fall .
these two events are both flaw@@ less .
what &apos;s more , they rarely happen together .
the autumn scenery and snow scenes are rarely seen together .
the snow will melt in warmer days and the autumn scenery may be over if the snow comes too late .
the snow scenes together with the autumn scenery are of the most beauty .
this is an extreme example of being flaw@@ less and uncommon .
so on that day , everyone was busy posting photos on We@@ Chat Mom@@ ents .
this is the reason .
likewise , a beauty of brilliance , beauty and morality is extremely rare , and so is extremely beautiful .
my example has suggested that what &apos;s beautiful is flaw@@ less and uncommon .
next , let &apos;s move to the beauty of science .
we already clarified on the science of beauty .
let &apos;s go on to talk about the beauty of science .
as we know it , science investigation is full of surprises .
being unexpected is being uncommon .
I do astronomy .
take astronomy as an example .
we know that most ground@@ breaking studies in astronomy are accidental and unintended .
I did a rough counting .
of a dozen or more Physics Nobel Prize winners in Astr@@ onomy institutes , only one wins because of the intended research results ; the rest of them win by unexpected results .
given the time limits , I will just give another example though there are plenty of them .
this story also related to a beauty .
in 1967 , Madam Bell discovered the radio pul@@ sar .
look at this young girl ; this is Madam Bell as a graduate student .
at that time , she was studying inter@@ stellar sc@@ in@@ til@@ lation , a phenomenon already known .
but by accident she discovered the radio pul@@ sar , periodic radio signals .
the photo on the far right was taken this summer in Hawaii . I met Prof .
bell there who had been an old acquaintance .
we chat@@ ted for a while .
we can see from the photo she is still stunning .
she is another representation of brilliance , beauty and morality .
this kind of women deserves our respect and admiration .
here are a few more photos that we may consider beautiful .
left is a photo from biology , dep@@ icting the S@@ cler@@ ot@@ in@@ ia s@@ cler@@ oti@@ orum spo@@ res .
in the middle is a photo of a finger po@@ king the soap bubbles .
at the far right is a photo of a galaxy .
these photos are thought as beautiful .
why ?
the phenomena are natural so they are flaw@@ less ; they cannot be seen with the naked eye so they are uncommon .
these phenomena happen a lot , but they are invisible to us , so we are amazed at the sight of them .
again , this explains my point .
these photos of science phenomena are no exception .
let us move to Einstein &apos;s general theory of relativity .
I mentioned earlier a hundred years ago on November 25th Einstein published the theory of general relativity , the most beautiful scientific theory ever .
General relativity builds on New@@ ton@@ ian mechanics ; Newton published his theory in 16@@ 87 .
this theory looks simple today .
Einstein extends Galileo &apos;s Law of In@@ er@@ tia to Newton &apos;s First Law and Second Law and gener@@ alizes Newton &apos;s third law , which are Newton &apos;s original works , as with the universal grav@@ itation .
in this way , we are able to account for Ke@@ pler &apos;s Three Laws .
this is the essence of his theory .
how is this &quot; flaw@@ less &quot; ?
well he gave a unified account of all the known observations and experimental data at the time .
this is flaw@@ less .
this is &quot; uncommon &quot; because this is the first quantitative and systematic scientific theory ever .
he predicted the existence of Neptune and this prediction was later verified by observation .
and the discovery of Neptune in turn established the legitimacy of Newton &apos;s theory of classic mechanics as the first natural science theory .
Newton &apos;s theory of mechanics was beautiful and flaw@@ less for his time .
however , some people do not see it that way , for example Einstein .
Einstein believed that Newton &apos;s Law of Universal Gr@@ av@@ itation is flawed in two aspects .
first , the theory is flawed .
Einstein believed that the instantaneous action in Newton &apos;s theory violates the Special Theory of Rel@@ ativity .
therefore , he went on to ask what is the nature of gravity ?
it is flawed in its applicability .
Einstein examined the prec@@ ession of the peri@@ hel@@ ion of Mercury in detail .
he believed that this could not be explained by Newton &apos;s theory of gravity .
so he wondered the applicability of Newton &apos;s theory of grav@@ itation .
these are two huge flaws for Einstein .
therefore , Einstein proposed the theory of general relativity that made up for the shortcomings of Newton &apos;s theory .
Einstein &apos;s theory is flaw@@ less . in this theory gravity is the consequence of the curvature of space @-@ time caused by the uneven distribution of mass .
the curved space @-@ time determines the movement of all matter , light waves included .
this theory is flaw@@ less in its applicability . it approxim@@ ates Newton &apos;s theory in the weak gravitational field and works more accurately than Newton &apos;s theory in the case of a strong gravitational field .
that is to say , General relativity is comparable to Newton &apos;s theory .
what &apos;s more , it can account for phenomena that cannot be explained by Newton &apos;s theory and works more accurately .
therefore , in this sense General Rel@@ ativity is flaw@@ less at that time .
this theory also needs to be uncommon to fit our definition of the law of beauty .
this is another example of flaw@@ less beauty . as we have discussed it explained the essence of gravity in theory and made up for the in@@ accuracy of Newton &apos;s theory in applicability .
a very good case is the P@@ recession of the peri@@ hel@@ ion of Mercury .
this is completely in@@ comprehensible by Newton &apos;s theory .
according to General Rel@@ ativity , as highlighted here the problem was neatly solved .
this made up for a major flaw in Newton &apos;s theory .
moreover , General relativity is uncommon because it is the first theory that connects matter with space @-@ time .
so we have talked about that Newton &apos;s theory was the first quantitative and systematic scientific theory at that time , and the theory of general relativity was the first one to connect matter with space @-@ time and the first one to reveal the curvature of space @-@ time in the material world .
space @-@ time was thought to be flat but now it is proven as curved .
moreover , this theory lead to the discovery of new types of celestial bodies and a series of new phenomena , black holes , cosmic expansion , gravitational deflection , gravitational red@@ shift , gravitational waves , etc. included .
most of these predictions have been observed and verified .
others still need verification .
I will give you another simple example .
about the deflection of light in the gravitational field of the Sun , a phenomenon which verified the prediction of general relativity .
according to General relativity , light rays of a distant celestial body will be defl@@ ected in the gravitational field of the Sun .
this prediction was later confirmed by experimental observations .
this verification completely demonstrated the superiority of General relativity over Newton &apos;s theory and got it more widely accepted .
is General Rel@@ ativity still flaw@@ less today ?
if we want to prove it as the most beautiful scientific theory ever , we first need to discuss whether it is flawed .
in the sense of applicability , it may feel hard to tell .
of course , this is not the fault of Einstein .
we feel difficult to judge its applicability because we have not truly understood it .
is it flawed theoretically ?
we know it is in conflict with some ideas in quantum theory .
I hope that Professor Pan may help us to solve this conflict in future .
at this moment , we are not yet in the position to decide whether quantum theory or general relativity is wrong .
in the case of sing@@ ularity , Einstein denied the existence of black hole predicted by his own theory , but he believed that it is possible to avoid sing@@ ul@@ arities .
quantum physic@@ ists believed that the avoidance of sing@@ ularity in quantum theory impossible .
however , none of these efforts has been successful .
I myself have done some research on sing@@ ularity .
my research shows that there is actually no sing@@ ularity inside the black hole .
we do not need new laws of nature .
instead , we need have a better understanding and application of General Rel@@ ativity .
this is me time @-@ traveling to report this result to Einstein a few years ago .
flaw@@ less !
therefore , Einstein &apos;s theory is still the most common yet flaw@@ less science theory for us today .
we are still expecting uncommon phenomena predicted by the general relativity .
for example , gravitational waves .
rumor has it , or news has it , that gravitational waves have been detected .
if that is truly the case , that &apos;s something deserving a Nobel Prize .
of course , we are looking forward to more surprises brought by this theory .
so what is the driving force of social development ? what is the nature of scientific and technological innovation ?
let us give an answer using our law of beauty .
there is no beauty that is universally applicable ; beauty is of diversified forms .
as we have discussed in this speech , the vitality of beauty comes from its diversity .
there is no end to beauty .
so , by pursuing beauty , we are actually driving our society forward .
as practitioners in engineering , we know that technological innovation is about re@@ med@@ ying weakness , and the ultimate purpose of scientific innovation is to find what uncommon .
therefore , my conclusion is this : the driving force of social development and the essence of technology innovation is the pursuit of beauty .
this is the end of my speech .
thank you !
hello everyone !
I &apos;m Yu Xi@@ u@@ hua .
today my speech is entitled &quot; Po@@ etry Is Not Something Bey@@ ond . &quot;
Wang Gu@@ o@@ zhen once said something about how besides our daily life we also have poetry and something beyond to pursue .
these words tr@@ icked , and are still tr@@ icking , many people .
luckily for me , I &apos;m not his fan , and so I &apos;ve never been tr@@ icked .
indeed , there is something beyond .
but that doesn &apos;t mean it is always good .
we might reach the far @-@ away fair@@ yland , only to find that , instead of blooming flowers , piles of waste are greeting us .
I have seen Wang Gu@@ o@@ zhen once on TV .
it was amazing to hear an old man at his age still using such rhetorical language to talk about the world beyond .
but sure , Wang Gu@@ o@@ zhen was a very good poet .
when he drew parall@@ els between poetry and the world beyond , it was difficult to ref@@ ute him , for a man can be pen@@ n@@ il@@ ess , but the world beyond is always there accompanying him .
so is poetry .
so that &apos;s Wang Gu@@ o@@ zh@@ en@@ .@@ With this simple dic@@ tum , he had his identity as a poet s@@ oundly secured .
my dear brother Feng Tang once said , &quot; I guess no one would deny I am a poet after I wrote sentences like &apos; Spring brigh@@ tens the world , but pal@@ es before you &apos; . &quot;
speaking of which , anyway , I sincerely wish that I was not remembered for that poem entitled &quot; I Cros@@ sed Half of China to Sleep with You . &quot;
though it might be everyone &apos;s wish to do that , to cross half of China to sleep with somebody .
poetry actually doesn &apos;t have much to do with the world beyond .
there is something beyond in poetry , but poetry is not located in the world beyond .
it is , and must be , linked with our actual life .
people who write poems understand that .
I always tell others that , if someone can &apos;t remain true to himself , lets himself down and is as negligible as a grain of dust , then what &apos;s the point of his affec@@ tation ?
and the joy brought by affec@@ tation , just like the most beautiful scenery , will wear off in our mind .
but poetry should not be an affec@@ tation . it links us with our life , and is part of life itself .
we can &apos;t imagine a farmer to write about the bust@@ ling city life .
nor is it possible for an office worker to describe how the bar@@ n@@ yard grass looks .
however , we can &apos;t , and shouldn &apos;t , refuse imagination .
without imagination mankind would never have been able to land on the moon .
and there is the moon , and the entire universe in poetry .
in one &apos;s imagination there is not only something beyond , but also something even beyond that .
poetry is like a path leading into an endless world beyond .
and here its role un@@ folds .
poetry means using words to make imagination concrete .
it seems as if a door has been opened for us to discover the secrets of the universe .
so poetry cannot just be written .
any cur@@ sory attempt would be ridic@@ ul@@ ed by poetry itself .
a poet must be scrupulous , and also think .
devotion and thoughts are both necessary .
those who equate any combination of lines with a poem must be as naive as those who think they are winning the Mah@@ j@@ ong game whenever they draw 13 tiles .
I always think that a poet should , more than anyone else , be a philosopher .
his philosophy does not have much to do with what we learn from the philosophy textbook .
it is always the thoughts in a poem , rather than a refreshing sentence , that will influence us .
those philosophical thoughts are only effective when they are combined with our life and feelings and strike a chord .
so if one wants to write good poems , he must keep learning and thinking .
that &apos;s the most basic work for a poet .
those who think being a poet is easy are either too silly , or just speculative .
in real life there is no room for speculation .
nor should there be speculation in poetry .
we write poems because we love them .
nothing will da@@ unt me so much as the thought that I am letting myself down .
as for me , I am known to you by several labels , such as cerebral pal@@ sy poet , or country@@ woman poet .
and rest assured , I hate those who call me country@@ woman .
or grass @-@ roots poet .
I never respond to or ref@@ ute those labels , for I am a kind person .
I can understand that they are actually necessary for publicity .
it &apos;s like , for example , the title of some We@@ Chat article which might read &quot; Look ! this woman is naked ! , &quot; but when you click on the link and open the article , you see some pup@@ pies instead .
but here I must emphasize that poetry has no labels .
it should not in any way be labeled .
any label attached to poetry is misleading , is disturbing and misunderstanding it , and is merely a short @-@ sighted self @-@ appro@@ bation .
nowadays two labels for poetry are quite popular : the academic poetry and the grass @-@ roots poetry .
well , the academic poets might have received better , more systematic education .
they might even be educating people with their systematic knowledge .
their knowledge has led them to a higher rung on the ladder .
but what does that have to do with poetry ?
if more knowledge and better education are equal to good poetry , then the Nobel Prize award ceremonies might have been cr@@ ammed with Chinese winners .
no , actually I am not right about that , for Chinese people are so proud .
we don &apos;t think too much of the Nobel Prize .
the grass @-@ roots poets are those who live among the under@@ class .
it means that they have lower social status and living standards .
but I never feel it &apos;s a bad thing at all to live among the grass @-@ roots .
nor is our life or soul inferior to that of anyone else .
I believe all the people are equal in being proud , so long as we understand and love our life .
but of course it &apos;s not easy to understand and love life , like I mentioned earlier , you just don &apos;t win the Mah@@ j@@ ong game because you have draw@@ n@@ 13 tiles .
all those divisions and labels , under close scrutiny , are actually not so important .
they are merely a pas@@ time in some people &apos; boring life .
or else how should they spend the rest of their life ?
but poetry itself never changes just because it is labeled differently .
what people think or encounter is different , then what they feel will also be different .
hence their poems are also different .
so we have to allow for the existence of some divisions and labels , so long as they exist on a small scale .
but if anyone goes too far in that way , I should say he is hop@@ elessly ignorant .
there is another thing I want to talk about here .
the other day , someone left a message on my blog , which I translated as : Yu Xi@@ u@@ hua , you can stop writing poems right now !
I wonder what he meant .
was he telling me that my poems were getting worse and worse for his taste ?
or that I should resign and not cling to the so @-@ called fame I &apos;ve earned ?
I could agree with neither though , especially the second .
no one is writing poems to gain fame and fortune .
I don &apos;t know other people , but I &apos;m sure I am not that kind of person .
when one starts writing a poem , the moment he takes up a pen , he has already disp@@ elled uti@@ lit@@ arian thoughts from his mind .
that is a poet &apos;s natural consciousness .
material things may change the external environment , but they rarely have a chance to alter the world in our mind .
just think , if one &apos;s inner mind is so susceptible to external forces , then how can he persist in his dreams , especially the un@@ profitable dreams about poetry ?
poetry for me is a spiritual journey , which soo@@ thes my heart and brings me peace of mind .
when a poet is writing , he is actually refreshing and repairing himself .
when one is attached to something and grows along with it , he might also , in the process , receive affection in return from that thing .
that will be enough .
and that &apos;s all I feel about being a poet .
and all I want to say today .
thank you !
I was born on January 28 , 1940 .
my mother told me that Shanghai January 28 In@@ cident happened on the same day , a day not to be forgotten .
my earliest childhood memory was the shelter of Chongqing .
at that time , all that I could see was the cave .
outside the Japanese plane was bombing .
inside there was the sound of bombing and the p@@ aled faces .
those p@@ aled faces behind the candle stroke me deeply .
it taught me that lagging behind leaves one vulnerable to attack .
I went to Beijing to go to university in 1957 .
the first patriotic education class was on the ruins of Yuan@@ ming Yuan .
I looked at the ruins and knew about how the Anglo @-@ French Al@@ lied Forces salv@@ aged the Yuan@@ ming Yuan for the second time in 1900 .
this concept of &quot; lagging behind leaves one vulnerable to attack &quot; was reinforced .
well , it was in 1957 , 56 years ago , far away from now .
looking back in 1957 , 1900 seemed a distant past .
if you think about it , even 1957 has gone away .
another 50 or more years has slipped by since 1957 .
however , time has changed .
different is the situation .
the era of humiliation has passed .
China now stands proudly at the center of the world !
what occurs to me is what stance China should take at the center of world .
I want to share with you my view today .
I believe self @-@ confidence is much needed .
I want to share with you three stories .
the first story happened in 2005 .
I went to Los Angeles for a conference held by the American Society of Civil Engineers .
at this meeting , representatives from all over the world met together and discussed about natural disaster prevention and collaboration .
I went on behalf of the China Civil Engineering Association .
the trip was exhausting , first from Puerto Rico to New York , where I talked with the editor of the Journal of Civil Engineering , and then from New York to Los Angeles .
I made it to the scene in quite a hurry , just around nine o &apos;clock before the meeting started .
after arriving at the scene , I found that the host was Professor Feng Mark , who was from Princeton .
he was very happy to see me , saying , &quot; While you are here , would you do a speech for us as a keynote speaker today ? &quot;
I came to this meeting on behalf of the China Civil Engineering Society .
it did not give me the task to do a speech , but now you want me to do one as a keynote speaker on such a short notice .
this task is very demanding .
it is quite uncommon .
I have never done such a thing before .
therefore , My first instinct was to reject it in a polite way .
nevertheless , a question occurred to me at this very moment .
I replied , &quot; Mr. Feng Mark , I was just wondering are there any other keynote speakers ? &quot;
he said , &quot; Yes , there are several of them . &quot;
I asked , &quot; Where do they come from ? &quot;
he replied , &quot; There is one from Japan . &quot;
when I heard there was going to be a keynote speaker from Japan , I changed my mind .
times have changed .
if there is a Japanese speech , then there ought to be a Chinese speech as well !
what &apos;s more , the Chin@@ ses keynote speaker ought to do a better speech than the Japanese speaker does !
therefore , I made up my mind and replied , &quot; Mr. Feng Mark , I will make an exception today and receive your invitation , but I have one favor to ask . would it be possible that I give my speech after the other keynote speakers do ? &quot;
he asked , &quot; Why ? &quot;
I replied , &quot; I am totally un@@ prepared . I need some time to prepare my p@@ pt . &quot;
however , in fact , it did not take me long to prepare the p@@ pt .
I just wanted to listen to the Japanese speaker first .
therefore , I listened in the audience after finishing my p@@ pt .
the conference began .
the Japanese was the first to speak .
in his speech , the Japanese speaker talked about Japan &apos;s achievements on integrated natural disaster prevention in areas such as earthquake , typhoon , earthquakes , t@@ sun@@ am@@ is , and so on .
the speech was great .
they had done a lot of work .
however , during the whole speech all he did was numer@@ ating what they did in Japan , on and on .
it suddenly daw@@ ned on me that the Japanese speaker were not confident enough so he was desperate to highlight their achievements .
therefore , I changed my topic at the last minute .
originally , I had planned to talk about the achievements made by China in infrastructure .
I changed my topic into Contribu@@ tion , Achiev@@ ement and Chall@@ eng@@ es facing us .
after listening to the Japanese speaker speaking , I thought I needed to focus more on the problems we had encountered .
because as a major power , China has a leading role in the world .
therefore , it was not appropriate for me to focus only on what China had achieved , making no mention of what needed to be improved .
I wanted to take a longer view and look at things judic@@ iously .
therefore , when I was on the stage , I talked about both achievements and challenges , with the challenges as my focus .
what challenges ?
the population problem .
we have a large population .
of course , I talked about problems such as aging and gender disparities , scarcity of some resources , insufficient per capita resources , pollution and natural disasters as well .
I listed the challenges facing China one by one and expressed our willingness to exchange experiences with other countries .
when I finished my speech , the audience applauded and some of them lined up to shake hands with me . I had not expected such an enthusiastic response .
this is a picture of the audiences lining up .
sitting in the middle of the front row was Professor Feng Mark .
among them , there were some acad@@ em@@ icians and distinguished professors such as Professor Ann and Frank Paul .
this was in 2005 .
I asked them afterwards , &quot; Why are you so interested in my report ? &quot;
these experts told me , &quot; We seldom have the chance to hear from a speaker coming from the mainland China , let alone to talk about their challenges in such an honest way . &quot;
I said , &quot; What is special about this ? &quot;
he said , &quot; This shows the Chinese are very confident . &quot;
this experience taught me that if we Chinese want to be seen as confident by the international community , we need to speak not only of our achievements but also of the challenges facing us .
moreover , we need to take these challenges seriously and work to solve them .
when we are giving a report on our academic achievements , we tend to emphasize our contributions .
if we can see it from another perspective , in addition to our contributions , we focus more on the challenges .
it will be seen as a manifestation of greater self @-@ confidence .
this is the first story .
here comes the second story .
a while ago , several students from Beijing came to me for an interview .
they asked , &quot; Mr. Liu , we want to hear your opinion on this . &quot;
on what ?
he asked , &quot; What is the shortest path to self @-@ realization for the young people ? &quot;
I asked , &quot; What do you mean ? &quot;
I mean how to attain self @-@ realization as soon as possible .
I asked , &quot; which is your doubt , self @-@ realization or the shortest path ? &quot;
this student must have thought that we do not speak the same language .
&quot; well , I mean how to attain self @-@ realization as soon as possible . &quot;
therefore , I said , &quot; do you mind if I re@@ word your question in a more straight forward way ? you were asking how a person can rise to the top as soon as possible , right ? &quot;
the classmate replied , &quot; Yes , that is another way to put the question ! &quot;
this aspiration seemed to me very different from that of our generation .
I said , &quot; if you ask me , an honest answer would be the best way to rise up is to go working at the grass @-@ roots level . &quot;
I told him that I went to university for five and a half years and graduate school for another five and a half years .
that was 11 years in total .
I was assigned to work at a third @-@ tier city after graduation .
in that remote city , when other colleges came to know that I had went to a graduate school , I was assigned to be in charge of the revolutionary movement of our institute .
my salary was a few yuan higher than the average . at that time , the practice of graduate diploma has not yet to be adopted in China .
therefore , I spent a few weeks writing critique articles before Mr. Cao came to me .
he said , &quot; X@@ ila , with your academic background , my advice to you is that you go working at the grassroots level . &quot;
at the end of this conversation , he added , &quot; right to grassroots level , it is a better choice . &quot;
therefore , after we had this conversation , on December 1st , 1968 , together with two students from Tong@@ ji University , I went to the No.@@ 3 processing plant on Jiang@@ ong Road , Ha@@ o@@ z@@ ik@@ ou Street , in N@@ ei@@ jiang city of Sichuan province .
when the workers there came to know the three new@@ comers were college graduates , they asked , &quot; Where would you sleep ? &quot;
we replied , &quot; we will sleep where the other colleagues do . &quot;
&quot; ah , it is crowded enough here . &quot;
we replied , &quot; No , we will sleep here as the others do . &quot;
well , where did the others sleep ?
on the work@@ bench of the sh@@ acks where the steel were stored .
&quot; fine , you can sleep here ! &quot;
we laid the bedding , lied down on the bench and covered ourselves with quilt .
overhead there was a serious leak on the roof . we could even see the moon from the hole . I still remember it was on the night of December 1st .
we settled down in that sh@@ ack .
however , it did not take long for the other workers to see our determination to work here .
therefore , they took us to sleep in their dorm and moved their baggage elsewhere to make room for us .
afterwards we continued to work there .
finally , in 1976 , we won the National Science Conference Award .
we continued to work on the theory .
later , I went to the United States and won A@@ SCE &apos;s Raymond C. Re@@ ese Research Prize in 1985 .
this was the first time this prize was given to a Chinese .
however , it was in that processing plant where our work started and developed .
I learned a lot from working with the colleagues there and came to realize that if we were confident with ourselves , we should take the difficult road and accumulate experience from working on the ground .
working on the ground is a great opportunity for us .
I want to show you another picture here .
this is a picture of a textbook for complementary education given to me by a foreign professor at an international conference .
you can see it is quite thick .
reading it , I found one of Chairman Mao &apos;s quotes .
during the Cultural Revolution , we used to have Chairman Mao &apos;s quotes printed on the textbooks , but usually just on the first page , not on every one .
it surprised me to find the quotes on the inner pages of the textbook as well .
the quotes went , &quot; All genuine knowledge originates in direct experience . &quot;
it said all genuine knowledge originates in direct experience !
I had been to the United States for many times .
in my conversation with some American professors , they expressed similar concerns .
what were we worrying ?
we were worried that people spent so much time working in the virtual world that some of them even chose to date in the virtual world .
over time , people may suffer from mental health issues and forget what it is like to live in the real world .
my view is that we need to have the self @-@ confidence to pursue courses of the greatest value with our best resources with an eye to solving real @-@ world problems .
this is the second story .
here comes the third story .
last year in December , as a member of the delegation of the China Association for Science and Technology , I went to Kyoto for the World Engineers Convention .
the meeting was a huge success .
at the end of the meeting , the president of the Japanese delegation asked , &quot; Professor Liu , would you do a speech on behalf of all the foreign guests ? &quot;
I felt that this invitation showed their approval for China , so I gladly accepted it .
the president himself talked about China briefly in his speech .
he mentioned two things in particular .
the first thing he mentioned was China &apos;s high @-@ speed rail , which has a top speed of 350 kilometers per hour .
he thought this speed had its problems .
of course , I knew the high speed had its problems , but I wanted to hear his view on it .
however , he just stopped there .
the second thing he mentioned was that China was no longer a developing country .
&quot; is not developing country . China is a developed country . &quot; in his words .
&quot; it is a developed country . &quot;
the president was nice to say so but it was obviously an over@@ statement .
no wonder he invited me to do the speech on behalf of the other foreign delegations .
so in my speech , I said , &quot; Mr. President , first , I would like to correct one point regards what you said about China . China is still a developing country . we are still faced with many challenges , such as population issues , resource issues , pollution and natural disasters . &quot;
&quot; we hope to learn from the rest of the international community . we are willing to learn from the developed countries their good practices , but we are also mindful that we do not go through the same process of trial and error .
with China &apos;s status , some messages have to be sent clearly .
I went on to say that China now stood at a joint .
what does this joint do ?
it works to bridge the gap between the east and west .
China stood on the joint of transforming from a developing country to a developed one .
we have the responsibility to learn from the West even though the East holds the engineering technology and data .
we have our own strengths .
we are fully confident towards the future
these were the three stories .
I hope , at this moment , you all have a better understanding of self @-@ confidence .
self @-@ confidence means that we see not only our own achievements but also our weakness and challenges .
we need to enhance our self @-@ confidence .
with self @-@ confidence , we will have the courage to work on the ground to get first @-@ hand and the most valuable information to advance our society .
we must be confident so that we will not get carried away by vanity .
we must stay calm , for the next century will be the century of &quot; great rejuven@@ ation of the Chinese nation &quot; !
thank you !
about one week ago , I carried out an investigation among my friends on We@@ Chat , and I called it &apos; What are the top three things that you want now ? &quot;
I sent the questionnaire to the chat group of my company , of which the employees were mostly males born after 1985 and in the 1990s .
two days later , I received more than two hundred replies , and many were quite interesting .
after sorting out these two hundred responses , I discovered the top five things that my young friends long for .
guess what is number one ?
what they want most now are apartments , likely because recently the price of residential property has been rising dramatically .
the second is money .
nowadays people are straightforward , and they will plainly say , &quot; I want money . &quot;
the third is health .
the fourth are cars .
well , the fifth is a little bit of a surprise to me , as many respondents wrote &apos; a beautiful woman &apos; in the fifth blank , and I guess that &apos;s probably because most of my co@@ workers are male .
there are certainly some interesting answers .
for example , one person only filled one blank out of three , and it read , &quot; I want a desirable father . &quot;
he probably thought that with a good father he could have all five things above .
among over two hundred replies , only three mentioned what I expected from the investigation .
do you know what that is ?
happiness .
then it struck me that perhaps young people in modern society believe that they will be happy as long as they possess the above @-@ mentioned five things .
as an entrepreneur , I have been contempl@@ ating over the past three years how we can truly possess something , and that &apos;s also what I want to talk about today .
three years ago , with preliminary plans for a second startup , my partner and I decided to go to Silicon Valley to conduct research and investigations .
although we had a lot of thoughts then , an unexpected experience changed our original intentions .
before departure , we booked a hom@@ est@@ ay on the international website Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , and it was very novel for us that we could stay at someone &apos;s home rather than a hotel .
when we arrived at San Francisco , it was an old couple that greeted us .
and much to our surprise , we slept under the same roof with them , as they provided us two vacant rooms in the house .
in China , it &apos;s un@@ imaginable to put up two strangers .
so we asked the old couple , &quot; Why would you entertain such an idea ? why are you willing to do so ? &quot;
&quot; we have vacant rooms as it is , &quot; they explained , &quot; and apart from the additional income that we can earn , we &apos;d also like to make friends with people from all over the world ; it &apos;s a pleasant experience . &quot;
we came back with thoughts and questions , and then we began to search on the Internet trying to find out what this pattern was .
then we found that in western countries , people have already been sharing their possessions with others , like their houses , cars , their time , or even their skills .
as we know now , a new economic system has developed from these platforms for sharing , called the sharing economy .
and the sharing economy is a simple concept .
what if there are idle resources while people &apos;s demands continue to grow ?
should we build more houses , or manufacture more cars ?
this would not be sustainable .
we have to share our surplus resources with those in need .
well , you might wonder , can we bring such a brilliant idea to China ?
speaking of how to introduce this pattern to China , we thought of people &apos;s biggest assets : houses , first , and then cars .
as mentioned before , we cannot accept the idea of having strangers staying in our own house .
it would take a long time to open our mind for this .
but how about cars ?
can we share our cars ?
when we went through the investigations and statistics for cars , we noticed an amazing imbalance between demand and supply .
300 million people have acquired driving licenses in 20@@ 13 while only more than 80 million of them own a car .
as forec@@ asted by the China Association of Autom@@ obile Manufac@@ tures , there will be 1 billion driving license be@@ arers within the coming ten years .
but do you know the maximal car capacity based on all the existing transportation facilities ?
it &apos;s only 300 million .
in other words , at present 200 million people have driving licenses but have no cars , and in the future this figure will be 700 million .
what can we do about this ?
currently , it &apos;s difficult to par@@ take in the license @-@ plate lottery in Beijing , and it &apos;s impossible to apply for a license plate in Shanghai .
I can hardly imagine under such circumstances that there will be 200 million more cars on the road and around my neighborhood .
again what can we do ?
the only solution is to offer our unused resources - 100 million private cars - and share them with others .
so we made up our minds to put this idea into practice .
our family and friends , however , opposed and doubted us when we first shared this idea with them .
they thought that it would be impossible in China for people to share their private items , like their cars , with strangers .
it &apos;s un@@ practical , and no one would do such a thing .
I once stayed in America for a while , and I noticed that young Americans live a life without much burdens after graduation .
they never hasten to buy a car or a house , and so you may wonder , how do they live ?
they rent cars and houses .
for example , perhaps now I live in a house at the seaside , then tomorrow I will move to a celebrity &apos;s house , or today I will drive this car , and tomorrow I will rent another one .
they won &apos;t buy these things until they can afford them .
well , do you think this is possible in our country ?
I believe the young men among us have a lot to say about this , especially those living in Shanghai .
when a young man pays a visit to his soon @-@ to @-@ be mother @-@ in @-@ law for the first time , he will rarely win her approval to marry her daughter if he says that his car or house is rented .
so how do we measure someone &apos;s value , especially that of a young person ?
we do so by what one owns .
well , this is quite the opposite from western countries , as they measure a young person &apos;s value by what he has experienced , and what kind of life he lives .
back then , we thought , why don &apos;t we bring some changes to China ?
why not challenge our traditional values ?
at this time , we encountered another problem , namely , we were challenged by the awkward situation of Chinese people not wanting to share their cars .
why ?
as the saying goes , &apos; forgive me for not sharing my car or my wife &apos; .
we repeatedly heard people say that it &apos;s unlikely for Chinese people to share .
we wondered what would it be like if we provided an opportunity for people to change ?
at the end of 20@@ 13 , we launched a platform for car @-@ sharing , the first of its kind .
two years later , we found that more and more people gradually accepted the sharing economy and began to share .
here are a few inspir@@ ational stories I &apos;d like to share with you .
I have a close friend who is a professor at a university , and we all call him professor Qi@@ u .
he bought an Aud@@ i Q@@ 5 in 2010 , and three years later , it was still in very good shape .
we were in desperate need of cars when we launched the platform .
so guess what we did ?
we called our family , relatives and friends one after another , and asked them , &quot; Can you support me ? can you register your car on my platform ? &quot;
they all said , &quot; Cer@@ tain@@ ly , I am very glad to do so . &quot;
&quot; you can take a picture of my car , and put related information on your platform on the condition that you won &apos;t lease out my car . &quot;
we thought , well then , let &apos;s take our first step .
professor Qi@@ u was one of them , and he offered his Aud@@ i Q@@ 5 .
three days later after we launched our platform , we received a phone call from a customer .
he said , &quot; I really want to rent this Aud@@ i Q@@ 5 . but the owner ignored me even though I sent him a message . so can you please talk with him about this ? &quot;
then we asked him , &quot; Why do you want to rent it ? &quot;
as we know , the Aud@@ i Q@@ 5 is quite a luxurious car .
he told us that he was a senior executive in a state @-@ owned enterprise .
with subsidies from this SO@@ E for car ren@@ t@@ als , he typically would go to traditional car @-@ renting entities .
but now he wanted to have a try on our platform , considering its high cost performance .
I have to tell you , Qi@@ u charged six hundred Yuan a day at that time .
this was a great value for an Aud@@ i Q@@ 5 rental .
when we figured out the customer &apos;s intentions , I called professor Qi@@ u .
as soon as he answered the phone , I said to him that we received an order from that customer .
he replied without a second thought , &quot; Wei@@ yu , I cannot , I will not lease out my car . &quot;
I didn &apos;t give up , and I persistently explained to him all the guarantees , including the insurance details for about half an hour .
in the end , he probably didn &apos;t want to hurt my feelings , so he made a concession , &quot; Fine , I will do you a favor then , Wei@@ yu . &quot;
you see , as a favor from him , he permitted me to lease out his car .
so the customer rented it for five days .
I was ap@@ prehensive about this order until five days later I got a phone call from Qi@@ u .
he spoke to me excit@@ edly , &quot; Wei@@ yu , I &apos;ve met this man before , we worked together in a research project once , and it &apos;s amazing how I know your customer ! he is nice , and he returned my car on time . &quot;
&quot; I feel great , as I also earned RMB 3,000 . &quot;
after this phone call , I felt relieved .
in less than two weeks , he called me again voluntarily and asked me , &quot; Wei@@ yu , any more orders ? I have waited for more than one week . &quot;
what a huge change of his attitude in such a short time ! it had only been two weeks or so !
the next story I want to share with you is my own experience .
as CEO of the platform , I had to personally experience all of its procedures shortly after its launch so as to continuously improve them , so each weekend , I would rent a lovely car .
since a Be@@ et@@ le was once my dream car , I ordered one on our platform one weekend .
when I met its owner , a handsome young man , he patiently explained to me the information about his car , and then he handed me a sheet of paper , much to my surprise .
this is the piece of paper that he gave me .
he had written down everything there is to be known about his car on this A@@ 4 paper and told me , &quot; If you have any problems , read this piece of paper . &quot;
I was quite shocked , and then saw him off as he left .
when I nearly finished reading , I noticed the last sentence , &quot; Your life is far more important than this car , so if in danger , please first make sure you and your passengers are safe . &quot;
in other words , he told me that in case of danger , I should secure my own safety and never mind the car .
I was so moved by his words that I kept this piece of paper this whole time .
I found myself unable to return his car to the agreed location as I was going to finish the rental , because I had an important meeting .
so I called him and asked whether he could take his car himself or not , which he agreed to without hesitation .
when I returned the car , I realized that the volume of fuel was less than it should be , and that I must therefore refund him as required by the platform .
so I took out 20 Yuan from my wallet and said this was the price difference for the fuel .
he flushed the moment he saw me hand the money to him and said , &quot; No , it &apos;s totally unnecessary , it &apos;s not a big deal , keep it . &quot;
and then he tent@@ atively asked , &quot; Can I have your We@@ Chat ID ? &quot;
certainly , I said .
so we exchanged our We@@ Chat ID@@ s .
after we left each other , he found out that I was the founder of At@@ z@@ u@@ che .
now , we are close friends .
who said that we Chinese cannot share ?
who said that owners won &apos;t offer up their cars ?
who said that we Chinese don &apos;t trust others ?
as long as we communicate with each other personally , I believe we can solve most of our problems effor@@ tlessly .
now I also want to tell a story about one of our ren@@ ters .
at the end of last year , we built a focus group for our loyal ren@@ ters .
one of them told us a piece of unexpected news at the beginning of our focus group , saying that he had sold his car .
we were stunned ; why did he sell his car ?
he then continued to recall his awful experience cont@@ ending for a parking spot every night when he came back to the neighborhood where he lived .
I am not sure whether you have had the same experience or not , but I have before .
so what did he suffer in order to have his own parking spot ?
it took a year for him to buy a parking spot in the neighborhood where he lived , and he installed a parking lock the next day .
but when he came back that night , he found the lock was picked , and the spot was occupied by the car of someone else .
he was driven mad by this , and he lost sleep that night .
the next morning , he waited there until the occupying car left , and then he parked his car back in his parking spot .
guess what he did next ?
he parked his car there for a month , not once leaving his parking spot uno@@ c@@ cupied .
he thought by doing this , no one would encro@@ ach upon his spot .
one month later , however , he began to reflect , &quot; Why do I do this ? &quot;
&quot; why do I waste my resources and assets ? &quot;
so he became determined to sell his car and never again be upset about parking spots .
what kind of life does he live now ?
well , from Monday to Friday , he leisurely goes to work by tr@@ am car and experiences no traffic jams ; on the weekend , he rents a Bu@@ ick business cou@@ pe if going out with the whole family , or an Aud@@ i or BMW in case of romantic occasions with his wife , which is quite high class .
he told us that he feels life is very pleasant now .
so when what we possess becomes a heavy burden for us , what &apos;s the meaning of having such things ?
finally , I &apos;d like to share a story told by one of our loyal customers on the platform .
last May , he called us , and shared a story that shocked my colleagues at at@@ z@@ u@@ che .
he said that his son , who is only three years old , said to him , &quot; Pap@@ a , you enrolled in At@@ z@@ u@@ che and rent out your car , so I want to rent mine , too . &quot;
then he asked his son , &quot; Why do you want to do that ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t use it , &quot; his son explained .
&quot; well what &apos;s your rental price ? &quot; he further inquired .
&quot; one coin a day , &quot; the child said .
&quot; why one coin ? &quot; his papa wondered .
&quot; then I can play on the kid@@ die ride at the entrance of the supermarket , &quot; the child said .
it was only one coin per ride on the kid@@ die ride .
this is a very simple thought .
that &apos;s the story of a child and his car .
we then provided a new channel on all of our platforms for little children to share their &apos; cars &apos; .
the first day we launched it , all the registered &apos; cars &apos; were rented out .
so what truly are possessions ?
do you insist in pursuing ownership over things that you don &apos;t have ?
or do you just change the way you live , to embrace a life without many property burdens , so as to grasp more opportunities to experience far better and more worthwhile things in life ?
meanwhile , if you already own something , is it really necessary to hold on to it ?
is it possible to open up your mind and try to share what you own with others ?
new modes of ownership will bring you different value , more joy and happiness .
so what truly are possessions ?
the answer , in a word , is to be rewarded more by not bothering yourself with actual ownership .
thank you all !
my topic today is Principles of Research .
in fact , every one of us has a strong curiosity when we are first born .
so , an eternal topic is about where we &apos;ve come from , where we &apos;re going , what the future holds for us , or what the future holds for humanity as a whole .
so , when you think about it , you may feel fear and discomfort , for example before you go out into the society or before you go to college or whatever , you may get upset .
many religions are born when people seek freedom , freedom , peace and security in their hearts .
I read a book written by Van Lo@@ on years ago because the Bible itself is difficult to understand .
van Lo@@ on wrote a book named The Story of the Bible .
it tells why Christianity was accepted by so many people .
because at that time , everyone had a very hard life and people were unequal .
some were no@@ bles and others were slaves .
however , the appearance of Bible showed people that whether a noble or a slave , they were all a child of God who created them .
it told people that they were equal and siblings , whether they were white , black or asian .
everyone was equal .
hearing this , the poor suddenly realized that they were actually the same and love equally by God .
it brought great relief to their soul .
this seems to me a very influential spiritual liberation in human history .
it &apos;s actually the same with Buddhism .
Sid@@ d@@ har@@ tha , also known as Sak@@ y@@ am@@ un@@ i , was living a great life when he was young , but once he went out of the palace , he suddenly saw that many people were suffering from poverty , hardship and death , so he wanted to find a way to deal with these fears , and then Buddhism was born .
the thing is , all this can easily be achieved during the pursuit of a free mind and inner peace .
all you need to do is to believe in it .
unfortunately , with the development of science , C@@ oper@@ nic@@ us , Galileo , Ke@@ pler and others discovered new knowledge through astronomical observations .
after Galileo used glass to make teles@@ copes and observe celestial phenomena , people accumulated a large amount of celestial data .
in 16@@ 87 , a man wrote a very important book called Mathem@@ atical Principles of Natural Philosophy .
that man was Isaac Newton .
he based everything on calculus and unified them with Newton &apos;s law of motion and the law of gravity .
the uniformity brought a new liberation of minds .
we can see many independent phenomena , such as when I let go a small ball in my hand , it will fall down ; such as the stars are moving in the sky and so on .
Newton believed that all these phenomena could be explained by the force of gravity .
Newton must have felt very satisfied .
he believed that all the phenomena in the sky that were so sacred could be easily explained by mathematics and by calculus .
then , a new revolution was born .
in fact , since ancient times , we have been studying various phenomena , including magnetism , electricity and light .
based on that , in 18@@ 64 , Max@@ well , the scientist , came up with the Max@@ well &apos;s equations .
with his equations , he unified many independent phenomena , such as the existence of electricity , magnetism , light .
this brought us a second spiritual liberation .
both theories tell us that a lot of things can be predicted , but on the other hand , you will find a lots of things unsatisfactory .
according to the laws of New@@ ton@@ ian mechanics , as long as we know the initial conditions , we can use the calculus equations to calculate .
we can then calculate how the particles make up the individual . this individual can be Pan Jian@@ wei , President Zhang Jie or any of you .
in that sense , who among you here today is going to be an entrepreneur or a university professor has nothing to do with personal effort in some sense .
because our fate was determined long ago by forces and equations .
it was not until the beginning of the last century , with the advent of quantum mechanics , that this problem was satisfactorily solved .
quantum mechanics tells us a basic principle .
that is , in daily life , it is impossible for me to be in Beijing at the same time when I am in Jia@@ ot@@ ong University .
as I have shown in the pictures , when I &apos;m here , I cannot be there .
it &apos;s impossible for me to appear in several places at the same time .
there is a principle called quantum super@@ position in quantum mechanics .
it tells us that in a universe , when you don &apos;t have any information about where an object is , the object could be everywhere at the time .
that can be calculated with wave function .
let me explain .
for example , I went to Frankfurt for a visit and then came back to Shanghai .
after returning to Shanghai , I found that I had been to Frankfurt 10,000 times , probably many times during the trip I was asleep , but also many times I was awake and knew my route .
so if when every@@ time I were asleep , there are people around me of course , suppose that there were not a single machine in the entire universe that could detect which route I had taken .
then since there are two routes , one passes by Moscow , the other Singapore , when I woke in Shanghai and people around asked me where I had come from , I would have a mixed feeling of the cold and the heat and I would be wondering which way I had taken .
if I stayed awake during the journey , I would have a clearer idea of the route and know where I come from .
quantum mechanics tells us that detecting an objective system with a very fine probe can have an effect on its whole process .
from this perspective , it represents a very positive philosophy .
you may then want to integrate quantum mechanics and relativity .
as I mentioned , classical mechanics doesn &apos;t answer the question of where we came from and where we go .
the world seems to go on forever .
we seem to be eternal , and time seems to go on forever .
by combining quantum mechanics with relativity , we can explore the origin of the universe .
about the origin of the universe , let &apos;s first assume how big the universe really is .
now we can see about a few thousand stars in the night sky , as shown here .
this is actually a very small part .
there are probably hundreds of billions of stars in the galaxy .
the universe we know is about 10 billion light years wide , and within this universe , there are hundreds of billions of galaxies .
from this point , you will find that the universe is so grand and you will be amazed by the vast@@ ness of the universe .
this sense of awe is necessary .
why ?
when science breaks down religious beliefs , we behave as if we can do whatever we want .
then once you are amazed by the vast universe and you are in awe of it , you will have some new feelings .
it was because of these processes that our lif@@ es evolved .
about 100 million to 200 million years ago , mammals emerged .
after a long period of evolution , hom@@ in@@ ids emerged a million years ago , and then hom@@ o sap@@ i@@ ens emerged a few hundred thousand years ago .
after the hom@@ o sap@@ i@@ ens , ten thousand years ago , modern man finally appeared .
it &apos;s basically the history of our entire world .
after so many years of scientific exploration , we are gradually answering the questions that have existed since the birth of mankind .
what will the future of mankind look like ?
we still don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s a good chance that this depends on the situation of the exploration of dark energy .
one possibility is that the universe will experience a big bang , then it will expand first before contracting .
another possibility is that it will expand forever .
some believe that the universe will continue to chill and the universe will experience a heat death .
therefore , many astronomers claimed that we are at the best age of the universe .
many people often ask , &quot; Are we the only living system in the universe ? the only system that allows life ? &quot;
of course , there are multiple views .
regardless of these divergent opinions , by all means , the mother universe has gi@@ vin birth to us , that is how we exist as individuals in the first place .
according to John Archi@@ bald Whe@@ el@@ er , it is no piece of cake for us to have eyes evolved and then explore the world with them .
from the Buddhist point of view , this is a kind of fate .
there is a deeper question .
as you may have noticed , there are many parall@@ els between the Bible , Chinese creation myths and the current big bang theory .
but there is a very important question that remains un@@ answered , which is why people have consciousness and thoughts that allow them to understand the world .
our point is that , with the development of quantum mechanics goes further , what impres@@ ses us most is that this provides us with a means to understand the universe .
knowledge of the universe has brought us many useful things , such as computers , information science , energy science , life science and material science .
they are all based on the applications of quantum mechanics laws .
with the development of this science , we can gradually gain an active control of these tiny qu@@ anta .
at present , there is a hot topic in the discussion among people .
people are worried that artificial intelligence will defeat human beings ?
till now , I think that we are very safe , this is just my personal opinion , maybe some of you here disagree .
but personally , I think we are very safe and we don &apos;t need to worry about being overtaken by Arti@@ ficial Intelligence for now .
let &apos;s come back to classical mechanics .
we know that classical mechanics is determin@@ istic .
it claims that everything can be measured accurately and that measurement has no effect on it .
the same applies to computers , where every piece of information and every program can be copied .
in addition , the computer has a big weakness .
it has no free will .
for example , there are two computers and two bottles of water .
if I were a machine and someone else told me that , &quot; Pan Jian@@ wei , fetch a bottle of water . &quot; now I &apos;m a robot .
if the distance between me and the two bottles of water is the same , if the energy I need and I will consume when fet@@ ching the water are completely identical , if all these are not set beforehand , then I will crash .
in the face of such a simple problem , even the most powerful computer could not make a simple judgment , if there are no human intervention or pres@@ etting .
I think that the generation of human consciousness may be explained by random@@ ness and wave function collapse in quantum mechanics .
that means as we learn more about quantum control and interactions , it may not be long before we discover the secrets of human consciousness .
I think the most amazing thing is that the universe has evolved from a non @-@ living state to the present state , and this process can in turn help us understand the world .
in fact , the topic today , &quot; Principles of Research , &quot; is from Einstein &apos;s speech at Max Pl@@ anc@@ k &apos;s 70@@ th birthday .
in his speech , he said that people always pursue cru@@ elly in order to satisfy their stomach .
I am sure that all of you are smart enough to do that .
however , Einstein didn &apos;t think it was enough to make you a complete person .
as I said , religion is a rather convenient solution , but science tells us that religion is unreliable .
Einstein learnt about the laws of physics at a very young age , so he knew there was no real heaven .
what is really reliable is our understanding and knowledge of the world through our observations and research .
this knowledge is eternal and independent from our existence .
the liberation that comes with understanding of the world will ultimately lead us to spiritual freedom and peaceful mindset .
I think that for all the scientists , the primary purpose of research is to acquire the spiritual freedom and a inner peace .
thank you !
this is a cloud above Feng@@ xian and there is nothing abnormal about it .
just imagine what if this very common cloud is composed of various questions .
here we may as well call it the &quot; Q@@ Cloud &quot; as in a cloud of questions .
this is a picture of the brain .
look closely , you will find that the cloud resembles the brain to some extent .
but do you know that to make such a cloud artificially - even though it can be seen every day - is an arduous work .
as another example , we meet many people every day so we have seen brains everyday , yet can we build a brain manually ?
unfortunately , it is more formidable .
during the last decade , a research team was obsessed with brain simulation .
this is Chris Eli@@ as@@ mith , a neuro@@ scientist from the University of Waterloo , Canada .
he has buil@@ te a project called Sp@@ au@@ n .
in the project , he built the simulation of a functioning brain with 2.5 million simulated neurons .
this brain is able to complete a series of tasks - from simple reasoning , to drawing and to some precise calculations .
Henry Mar@@ k@@ ram , the founder of Blue Brain Project , who is more passionate about brain simulation than Chris , has led a project much more challenging .
as he claimed , the project would create a simulation of the entire human brain within a decade .
on January 23 , 20@@ 13 , the European Union funded the Project to the tune of 1 billion euros .
such a project is also known as &quot; the space plan &quot; in the sector of artificial intelligence .
while I am thinking that the brains of everyone here are actually evolved from a prototype 100,000 years ago , and the recorded history of human civilization is merely 10,000 years .
each human brain , weighing about 1.@@ 4@@ kg , is made up of 86 billion nerve cells .
why do people spend so much time building a virtual electronic brain ?
then let us step back and think more objectively , even if such brain is built ultimately , it is no more than an individual creation .
there are almost 600 of you here today and if we assume that the average brain age of everyone here is 30 years old , then we will possess 18@@ ,000 years of brain age , which is 80 million years more than the entire human civilization .
therefore , the knowledge system embodied in this venue is rather large and complete .
what if we connect every brain in the hall ?
here I propose a new plan , a &quot; Connec@@ ted Human Brain Project . &quot;
so , is it possible for the brain to be connected together ?
many of us here may work as teachers .
if every teacher here had been engaged in teaching for ten years , then we would have 6,000 years of teaching experience .
even if Confucius is still alive , he would only earn 2,500 years of that .
provided that all the teachers unite to do something for education , how powerful the brain would be ?
therefore , I reckon that the connected brain project may be more realistic than a virtual brain project .
next , I will briefly demonstrate the feasibility and necessity of the connected brain project .
how do we connect human brains together ?
in the past , such demanding task may be done through indirect communication .
for instance , when I write a book , whoever read the work will enter my thinking space .
as it comes to the era of mobile Internet , it seems to be much easier to connect human brains together .
people are able to talk and communicate with each other by telephone , all these lay a solid technical foundation for human being to implement a connected brain project .
the first question for a connected brain project is that we need to create a &quot; Q@@ Cloud &quot; first .
our brains may be connected when all of us here think about the same question .
then if we use one connected brain to ponder all the questions , a so @-@ called &quot; Q@@ Cloud &quot; would be created .
such a &quot; Q@@ Cloud &quot; should contain elements like cloud storage , cloud computing , cloud processing , cloud sharing and cloud push .
in which what matters most is that clouds can interact with each other .
at present , the connection between knowledge has been streamlined by our knowledge engineers , which may greatly boost the evolution and development of the cloud itself .
in this context , it will be much easier for a &quot; Q@@ Cloud &quot; to be built when myriad people use the connected brain to think .
now let me share a simple case to introduce how the &quot; Q@@ Cloud &quot; will be realized .
I once led my students to carry out a research .
on what ?
the ants .
three students were interested in ants , so what about ants that interested them ?
they wanted to know what did a ant nest look like .
the ant nest we usually see is just a small hole , so they post the question on the platform of &quot; Q@@ cloud , &quot; &quot; Who knows the structure of a ant nest ? &quot;
some other students were not interested in ant nests so they were thinking about a different question .
they pon@@ dered whether the nests built by the same ants were identical or whether ant nests will differ when they were built by different ants .
so they also submitted the question on the &quot; Q@@ cloud . &quot;
there was another group a students who focused on what kind of environment ants favored , whether it was dry or wet , and what kind of temperature .
such questions were also posted on the platform .
as an increasing number of such questions were posted , the cloud platform would collect all the ant @-@ related questions on each terminal and pus@@ he them to teachers or students interested in this topic .
then a &quot; Q@@ cloud &quot; has taken shape .
in return , more and more teachers as well as students post their questions about ants on the platform .
on this platform , we can see someone may be absorbed in the behaviors of ants such as how ants move their nests , why ants fight and queue up .
while others may be fascinated by the structure of ant nests like how the nests &apos; property management work .
when numerous questions were raised collectively , a ant @-@ them@@ ed &quot; Q@@ cloud &quot; took form .
by virtue of the &quot; Q@@ Cloud , &quot; students are able to share their questions , researches and data with each other , thus accelerating the development of ant @-@ related researches .
with constant upgrading on its own , the &quot; Q@@ Cloud &quot; may become a brain shared by lots of people .
that is a &quot; Q@@ cloud . &quot;
the born of the &quot; Q@@ Cloud &quot; and the knowledge that came with it have brought up a new question : can we turn it into an &quot; Innovation storm &quot; that prosper@@ s the industry .
as educators , we do hope to turn this cloud technology or the &quot; Q@@ Cloud &quot; into an educational process , which is also the born of an &quot; Innovation storm . &quot;
with respect to this issue , mo@@ ors offer a technical model for the transformation from the &quot; Q@@ Cloud &quot; to an &quot; Innovation storm . &quot;
what are mo@@ ors ?
you may have never heard of it , but MO@@ OR is short for Mas@@ sive Open Online Research .
it is a massive online research and development open access platform .
in 2003 , Professor Pav@@ el P@@ ev@@ z@@ ner of the University of California in San Diego launched for the first time a course dedicated to bio@@ inform@@ atics studies through a platform called Cour@@ ser@@ a .
you may be not familiar with MO@@ OR , however , I bet you are acquainted with MO@@ O@@ CS or the massive open online courses .
generally , there are three platforms for MO@@ OC .
it was Professor Pav@@ el who first claimed that the platform was designed to conduct researches rather than disseminating knowledge , that &apos;s why he renamed it as MO@@ OR .
moor is different from MO@@ OC , yet they are connected to each other .
here is a brief explanation .
most people are familiar with M@@ oo@@ c .
in terms of the content , it often presents existed problems , with more focus the reproduction of a course ; while MO@@ OR emphasizes thinking about new and unknown problems .
MO@@ OC focuses on inheritance and construction , yet MO@@ OR highlights innovation and development .
MO@@ OC centers on receptive learning while MO@@ OR gives priority to research @-@ based study .
fourthly , MO@@ OC attaches great importance to the results .
as we all know , MO@@ OC adopts the mode of high @-@ selection and high @-@ exclusion .
it is very likely that only a few hundred out of 100,000 people pass the final test of the course as the definite answers to questions account for a relatively large proportion .
however , MO@@ OR centered on the research @-@ based study .
it lays more emphasis on the research process rather than the inheritance of the past knowledge .
therefore it is more research @-@ oriented .
fif@@ thly , MO@@ OC has clear assessment objectives for most time .
you pass the course when meeting the correspondent demands .
whereas with a major emphasis on the process of innovation , MO@@ OR is more about a in @-@ depth and evolving journey , without a fixed objective .
these are the major differences between MO@@ OC and MO@@ OR .
why MO@@ OR is of great value to our education ?
maybe we can analyze this from the perspective of human cognition .
for human cognition and the known world , namely how humans pass the knowledge of our ancestors to fut@@ ur generations , we call it the known world because there are answers known .
the knowledge teachers hold is merely of subset and the teachers would like to impart all their acquired knowledge to the students .
in the last year alone , the figure of newly established Internet education companies reached 2.5 every day .
most of the enterprises are obsessed with teaching methods - how to pass knowledge on to students more effectively , how to make students understand on a more thorough and solid basis - with a view to earn higher test scores .
however , they barely touched the unknown sector .
as we all know , it is impossible to understand the unknown world with educational courses alone , so scientific inquiry activities are bound to be implemented .
the problems faced by MO@@ OR or &quot; Q@@ Cloud &quot; are exactly the unknown world .
it is our hope that , all people could make concerted effort to study and explore the unknown world .
moor is just designed for such courses .
in this regard , mo@@ ors are particularly valuable for basic education in China .
look at this picture .
a pupil at grade five wrote &quot; Baidu knows &quot; on the answer sheet for the problem he felt elusive so he wrote &quot; Baidu knows . &quot;
surprisingly , he got a full mark for the question because technically the answer itself is correct .
we can know the answer by virtue of Baidu search .
for instance , &quot; What is the role of the root , &quot; we can ba@@ id@@ u the answer .
yet , if the answers to all the test questions prepared by the teacher can be filled after you ba@@ id@@ u them , the examination paper itself is not as challenging as it should be .
therefore , for human being , we hope to organize the students to study in a more creative manner .
against this backdrop , the &quot; Q@@ cloud &quot; is endowed with unique value .
just upload the most complicated and arduous questions to the cloud .
let &apos;s say everyone here proposes one question , then we will get 600 questions in total .
if every question is of some sort of value , we will obtain 600 good questions .
provided that each good question is able to draw attention of 60,000 brains , the entire society will exercise all @-@ round innovation and the era of mass innovation is just ahead .
for it is shown that the more attention a question gains , the more possible it will have breakthroughs .
just as the case of Ta@@ obao that was not well @-@ received in the early stage and grew up in the buzz .
nevertheless , it is a very good way to attract s@@ warms of consumers to put forward their doubts , questions and complaints on the platform .
eventually , Ta@@ obao becomes a fairly perfect on @-@ line shopping system .
by the same token , if everyone here posts your most v@@ exing problems on the cloud , such problems may attract some solutions from various areas .
therefore , everyone from entrepreneurs to house@@ wives and to students , can upload your doubts to the cloud .
these questions will invoke all the people to think , to explore and to study together .
I believe that &quot; Q@@ Cloud &quot; is able to take shape with myriad questions in this era .
and these &quot; Q@@ Cl@@ ou@@ ds &quot; will eventually lead to the innovative practices of everyone .
at this moment , they are successfully transformed into an &quot; Innovation storm , &quot; facilitating the growth of every student .
this is the core value of the &quot; Q@@ Cloud . &quot;
the question is the &quot; Q@@ Cloud &quot; will not certainly spontaneously transform into the &quot; In@@ nov@@ ative storm . &quot;
it requires that all educators to constantly sit hun@@ ched over desks and lap@@ tops .
I think in a Internet era , the following supports are essential to convert the &quot; Q@@ Cloud &quot; into an innovative course for all students .
first , it requires an open , free and online environment accessible to all users .
secondly , it demands personalized content , specialized learning process and team @-@ based growth .
on this basis , the &quot; Q@@ cloud &quot; also needs big data support , intelligent management , mobile Internet thinking and social network thinking , which are crucial guiding principles for the construction of &quot; Q@@ Cloud . &quot;
on top of that , it should profit from the combination of science and artificial intelligence so that it could conduct emotional motivation and navigation , as well as favorable collaboration with the nature of children .
rather th@@ ant just thinking about how to import knowledge into the students &apos; brain more effectively .
it certainly also requires an evaluation mechanism that supports the pr@@ atical resources .
in addition , we prefer to see the &quot; Q@@ Cloud &quot; itself continuously evolve and develop based on the learner model , in a bid to fully tap the role of knowledge engineering in the evolution and development of knowledge itself .
as a teacher , what I care more is about how to involve the students in the process of innovation in the form of course .
so the transformation of a &quot; Q@@ Cloud &quot; to an &quot; Innovation storm &quot; requires everyone &apos;s continuous attention , joint exploration and concerted efforts to promote research and practices for the generation , development and resolution of questions .
I hope that very educator here is willing to contribute his or her wisdom and strength to the development and implementation of the &quot; Q@@ Cloud . &quot;
then a large curriculum system will take shape throughout the entire society .
such curriculum system , ubiquitous , will drive the growth of every student .
at that time , the fate of every learner will be closely tied to the innovation of our whole nation .
we y@@ earn for that day to come as soon as possible and we hope that all of us can devote ourselves to the progress of the &quot; Q@@ Cloud . &quot;
thank you .
in 2015 , I brought my little girl , a typical generation Z , to her first cross @-@ country half marathon .
she was also the youngest runner in this extreme endurance challenge , which gathered conte@@ stants from across the world irrespective of their ethnicity or nationality .
there were two things I did in 2015 that made me proud .
the first thing was that I put my kid through an uncommon challenge .
and I &apos;ll talk about my motivation in the latter part of this speech .
the second thing was that I had my identity changed in 2015 .
I quit as a manager , also a senior executive with 12 years of working experience , in a listed company .
then I joined the entrepreneurship wave and founded my own business .
and I &apos;d attribute the two interesting moves I made in 2015 to a very unusual research report I finished between 2012 and 20@@ 14 .
during the two years , I found a whole new world unfolding before me .
today I &apos;d like to take this precious opportunity to share something in the report with you .
what the report presented jol@@ ted me into new thoughts about my future , our children &apos;s future , and our nation and country &apos;s future .
the research , un@@ published , was entrusted to us by a central department .
it lasted one year and a half , and involved seven doctors and post @-@ doctors from seven different sectors .
and it &apos;s comforting to know that , two of our suggestions in the report were adopted and implemented by the government to deal with different issues in a different way .
first , they have largely helped improve China &apos;s birth control policies .
second , they have boosted the momentum of entrepreneurship and innovation .
actually when we finished the report , we didn &apos;t expect so many changes would occur in policy @-@ making in no more than one year .
that was a great comfort for the seven of us researchers .
but numbers , appalling numbers , are my focus today .
our research was first launched because of the sixth national census in 2010 .
this census presented some troubling figures that would haunt my mind and remind me of how terrible a situation our kids would be stuck in when they are at my age .
according to the figures , the post @-@ 8@@ 0s in China amounted to 228 million , while the post @-@ 9@@ 0s and the generation Z respectively totaled 171 million and 122 million .
there was a 20 % to 30 % decrease per decade in the number of the new@@ bor@@ ns .
such rapid decrease is very rare or even unprecedented in the world , especially in countries with a massive population
against this dismal background , we conducted a one @-@ year @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ long research about the changes seen in China &apos;s demographic structure , labor force quality and efficiency .
we also touched on the topic of where China will be going in the following 30 years .
now I &apos;d like to share some of the results with you .
the first thing is that China &apos;s demographic structures , including that of its new@@ bor@@ ns , are managed with artificial efforts .
under artificial birth control , there might be birth peaks , or even bans on giving birth to children .
this artificial birth control results in a fluctu@@ ating population with several peaks .
from 1966 to 1974 , over 300 million new babies were born .
among whom I myself was a member . the years 1968 , 1969 and 1970 saw the first population peak .
the 3@@ 10 million new population was to become the major source of China &apos;s large production and consumption dividends during the first three decades of its reform and opening @-@ up .
the second population peak occurred between 1985 and 1996 , with 180 million new babies born , out of the previous baby bo@@ omer generation , as you can guess .
when will the third population peak come then ?
it might come when the generation Z becomes parents , and it might produce a population of only 94 million . that is hardly 100 million .
let &apos;s forget about the third peak , and just focus on the first two peaks .
and by in@@ ferring from these two peaks we got some very exact numbers .
there will be a sharp decline of effective labor force from 2030 to 20@@ 33 .
that &apos;s to say , we baby bo@@ omers born between 1966 and 1974 will all have to withdraw from workplace , by retiring at 60 years old .
but of course there is a big chance that our retirement will be delayed .
right , we &apos;ll then have to work a few more years .
the truth is , retirement can be delayed due to shortage of pensions , but the delay does do no actual good to the entire society .
let &apos;s calculate , if at 60 years old , around year 20@@ 33 , we , the entire 3@@ 10 million population , withdraw from workplace , then what kind of society shall we face ?
in 20@@ 33 , or at the latest in 20@@ 34 , we &apos;ll have to let 700 million people provide for another 700 million people .
how do we know that ?
around 20@@ 33 , there will be some 4@@ 40 million over @-@ 60 @-@ year @-@ olds , and 240 million people that must be taken care of , including the 90 million @-@ plus disabled and 100 million @-@ plus minors .
that brings the total number of depend@@ ents to about 6@@ 80 million .
according to predictions , China &apos;s population base of 14@@ 00 million might hardly increase in future .
hence basically we can infer that the dependency ratio of China might reach 1 : 1 ( 700 million feeding another 700 million ) , a standard indicator in dem@@ ography .
this dependency ratio is also of significance for the study of demographic structures and production .
for example , the G@@ ini coefficient of a country we frequently mention may indicate the production , creative and innovative capability and the burden of a nation , a ethnic group , a country or a certain population .
we compared China with 54 countries which have also experienced a 1 : 1 dependency ration .
so what did we learn ?
over twenty of the developed countries are basically suffering a drastic decline in their economic and GDP growth .
the growth rate could be extremely low for decades , and sometimes it might verge on zero .
some of the developing countries achieved the 1 : 1 dependency ratio even before they got rich , and now they all , with no exception , fall into the middle @-@ income trap .
but the bigger problem for us is that , all the countries we compared with China only have a population of tens of millions .
even though their dependency ratio is 1 : 1 , it only means tens of millions will provide for another group of tens of millions .
but here in China we &apos;ll let 700 million people feed another 700 million people .
we have no historical experience in that .
only one country of all with a 1 : 1 dependency ratio bears some resemblance to China and thus might provide a useful reference for China .
it is Japan .
for over 20 years Japan &apos;s dependency ratio remained 1 : 1 .
it &apos;s also an aging country whose economy has been stagnant for more than 20 years .
its population has surpassed 100 million .
that means , about 50 million Japanese people have to feed another 50 million Japanese people .
OK , but I guess , compared with Japan , our burden is far more formidable .
and there is something even more terrible .
when we were doing our research , we po@@ red over Japan &apos;s population data and studied all the patterns its economic growth had assumed .
and we found that it took Japan only 20 years or so to shift from a fast @-@ growing economy which made the best use of young population to an aging country .
it was a short cycle indeed .
when Japan entered the aging period between 1992 and 1993 , when it declared that its dependency ratio had almost reached 1 : 1 , 65 percent of its GDP was being propelled by its ability to transform the scientific and technological achievements into economic growth .
some of us here today perhaps understand how the economy , or macro @-@ economy , works . and you might have noticed that though Japan has sunk into an economic stagnation , the standard of living of its people is not sacrificed .
on my way up here just now I took a close look at the cam@@ c@@ orders and cameras there in the back , and found that almost all our filming and photograph@@ ing tools here are made in Japan .
and Japanese cars , und@@ aun@@ ted by their US rivals , still dominate the US automobile market .
that is Japan . a severely aging country whose economy has been in stagnation for over twenty years .
but what happens to China today ?
using Japan as a reference , we &apos;ve found something threatening .
when Japan &apos;s dependency ratio hit 1 : 1 , 65 percent of its GDP was boosted by its ability to transform the scientific and technological achievements .
but in today &apos;s China , among the top ten GDP drivers , which pro@@ pel over 60 % of its GDP , almost none is related to such a transforming ability .
as we , especially I , can see , the No. 1 economic driver in China is something I &apos;ve worked in for over twenty years : the real estate industry .
but in some sense , this industry is consuming land and resources without producing future benefits .
it is actually kidnapping China &apos;s economic development .
such comparisons about numbers and the economic structure left us in a panic .
there are only 15 , or at most 18 years left for us before the dependency ratio hits 1 : 1 .
it will be a big challenge for us to , within this period , truly transform the economic structure and let science and technologies lead the economic development .
why must we complete the transformation within the 15 years ?
why does our window only last 10 to 15 years ?
that is decided by the creativity of our entire population .
a Harvard study about the population creativity of different countries revealed that , all the disco@@ vere@@ rs , invent@@ ors and promot@@ ers of the important inventions , innovations and the guiding sciences and technologies are young people aged from 20 to 40 , 25 to 40 being their golden time .
but when a country , like China , is suffering a drastic decline in the young population , how can we be sure that , when it reaches the dismal 1 : 1 dependency ratio , it will have enough creativity ?
that &apos;s what alarmed us when we finished our report .
and there is something even more terrible that that .
when we were studying the 700 million bread @-@ ear@@ ners , we set up another indicator that measured their valid ability to feed the 700 million depend@@ ents .
the seven of us , who specialized in seven different fields , spent three to four months in analyzing the data and finally came up with our respective answer .
the figures were terribly grim .
the lowest rate of valid feeding was 30 % .
what does that mean ?
it means 200 million people will have to provide for another 12@@ 00 million people .
the figure 30 percent almost rendered us speechless .
we complained to its sub@@ mit@@ ter that if such a figure became true , then there might be no point doing the research .
maybe we &apos;ll just leave things to fate .
the highest result was 70 percent , which means there would be 500 million bread @-@ ear@@ ners .
now I &apos;ll give you a chance to guess , that person who said 30 percent , which sector did he come from ? the seven of us came from seven different sectors that are : science , education , industry , internet , finance , medical care and national defense .
I don &apos;t mean to offend anyone here , but he worked in education .
so we asked this post @-@ doctor in education , &quot; Why are you so sure that only 200 million of the 700 million bread @-@ ear@@ ners will be useful ? &quot;
and he explained to us , &quot; 500 million of the 700 million have been born , but you should know that those 500 million people also include children from the poor regions , migrant workers &apos; children , left @-@ behind children , abducted children and criminals &apos; children@@ . bl@@ ah bl@@ ah bl@@ ah ... &quot;
&quot; how can those people be counted on to feed other people ? &quot;
he insisted , &quot; It will be pretty great that they can feed themselves . &quot;
but we disagreed with his over@@ generalization .
we thought 40 percent might be a more reasonable figure .
though we dismissed the figure 30 percent as being ill @-@ founded , we accepted the figure 70 percent as something quite probable .
what will that be like , when 500 million people have to feed another 900 million people ?
do you know how many people today are earning bread for others in today &apos;s China ?
we &apos;ve already known from Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ iang &apos;s government work report that , in today &apos;s China , 900 million people are providing for another 500 million people .
but in 15 or 18 years , the situation will be reversed : 500 million will have to feed another 900 million .
that &apos;s really a terrible thing .
one day in the summer of 20@@ 14 , when I &apos;d just finished the research report , I went back home and found my daughter doing her homework .
then I couldn &apos;t help wondering how the figures in my report would have anything to do with her .
she will turn 30 in 15 years , around 2030 , exactly the time when she will have to face a country with a 1 : 1 dependency ratio .
I mentioned earlier in my speech that 180 million babies were born bet@@ we@@ en@@ 1985 and 1996 .
these 180 million people I wish you could really pay attention to .
speakers like Wei Yu just now , belongs to this 180 million people .
they are now in their prime time , aged from 20 to 30 years old .
and they are fighting together with us post @-@ 6@@ 0s , all the post @-@ 7@@ 0s and some post @-@ 8@@ 0s .
now is the best time for China &apos;s labor force , and only ten golden years of it are left .
once the ten years pass , much more burden will be placed on the shoulder of the labor force .
so , if within the next ten years , the 180 million young people could fully engage in the transformation of Chinese economic structure and truly pro@@ pel scientific innovation and technological development , then they might help China successfully get through the population crisis that &apos;s to come in 15 to 18 years .
when I was preparing my speech , the organizer asked me what topic I would choose .
I said I &apos;d like to talk about the education of children .
but most importantly , I wanted to tell the next generation of young people that whatever they do , they must strengthen their sense of innovation and competition , and always h@@ one their sword , for they have no choice .
to sum up , I think those alarming figures indicate the beginning of a worst era for human beings , but they can also her@@ ald a best era in which we might feel lucky to live .
we might have never imagined that we will one day step into a great but unpredictable age of transformation full of uncertainties , and we are also facing harsh challenges .
so what shall we do in such a transitional period ?
what legacy can we leave to our offspring , and how shall we respond to the call of the age ?
shall we choose to be abandoned by time , or shall we just plunge into the tide of great transformation ?
this is an age where we can make a difference .
let &apos;s work together for a happy ending .
thank you .
I know this place at my finger@@ tips , the venue of Expo 2010 .
six years ago , I did a great number of interviews here .
and today , my topic is also related to the theme of the exposition , &quot; Better City , Better Life &quot; .
but is it true that a better city brings a better life ?
hence , I named my speech &quot; Cooperation or Con@@ fron@@ tation , &quot; which may be odd to you .
six years ago when Expo 2010 was widely publicized , there was another grave news which you may forget , and the news was lasting for a whole year .
the news happened to a quite well @-@ known company , F@@ ox@@ con@@ n .
at that time , over a dozen F@@ ox@@ con@@ n &apos;s employees jumped to their death one after another .
not only at its headquarters in Shenzhen , but also at its plants in many other regions , such as Lang@@ fang , Hebei and Sichuan , many of its employees jump off a building .
as a journalist , I wanted to look into the news so I paid a special visit to F@@ ox@@ con@@ n .
we all know that all the plants of F@@ ox@@ con@@ n in spite of different locations share the same feature , the huge number of workers .
I visited one of its plant in Shenzhen and found a surprising number .
there were 4@@ 20,000 employees .
4@@ 20,000 workers lived and worked in a giant F@@ ox@@ con@@ n plant .
we often suspected that F@@ ox@@ con@@ n might be cruel to its workers , offering them slender salaries , forcing them to manage heavy workload , or ruling them with an iron fist .
however , I would like to tell you , the suspicion against F@@ ox@@ con@@ n is dis@@ proved .
F@@ ox@@ con@@ n in fact offers great benefits to many employees .
it even prepares very professional swimming pools for many employees , and free art centers , cost @-@ effective can@@ teens , many convenient cinemas and stores as well , so that plenty of employees can enjoy a better life .
while many media were talking about the potential deprivation that F@@ ox@@ con@@ n did to its workers , I carried out an in @-@ depth investigation and came to a conclusion .
of course my conclusion couldn &apos;t cover all the reasons behind the jumps , but I think it may be one of the factors .
have you noticed that the majority of the 4@@ 20,000 residents of the F@@ ox@@ con@@ n city were post @-@ 8@@ 0s and post @-@ 9@@ 0s .
to my knowledge , people who live in such city for long would know nothing but competition and confrontation .
a real nice city should have the feature of being age @-@ friendly .
literally , it means being nice to all age groups .
an age @-@ friendly city should consist of elders , young adults and children .
if the senior find it desp@@ on@@ dent , the moment when they see children , they see hope .
if they are pessimistic about their life , on the verge of breakdown , young adults would realize that everyone can ride out the storm when seeing elders .
being age @-@ friendly is an important philosophy of governing communities as well as cities .
my aunt passed away , hmm , two months ago .
she used to be cheerful and helpful , willing to help neighbors with all kinds of problems .
she played a very active role in her community .
later , arranged by the family , she lived in a nursing home .
I met her after she had been in nursing home for six months , and she seemed like a different person .
she sighed : &quot; Luo Xin , human are doomed to die , and I will die sooner or later . &quot;
she said so because two of her four room@@ mates had gone successively .
the death indeed had an impact on her .
likewise , the 4@@ 20,000 , or even millions of , young workers in F@@ ox@@ con@@ n were trapped in a similar situation .
the young residents may be haunted by competition , for they can &apos;t see elders or kids but only competitors .
the only ambition of competitors is to win .
probably , the victims felt abandoned and valu@@ eless due to a lost opportunity , a lost game or even the criticism from leaders .
do you know what is the greatest pain for human beings ?
it is not death .
the first is feeling guilty , and the second is feeling abandoned and valu@@ eless .
therefore , the city we are going to talk about today is the current physical environment we live in , a visible city .
when you stand in front of an enormous plant or a towering building , do you ever feel that you are so small and of no account ?
if you are asked to choose between New York and Hawaii as a place of residence , I bet most would prefer the latter .
there , in Hawaii , without many high rises , people may retain their human dignity .
in 1961 , famous Jane Jac@@ obs , an American @-@ Canadian lady , published her book , The Death and Life of Great American Cities .
in her work , Jane Jac@@ obs for the first time criticized metropol@@ ises and non @-@ age @-@ friendly cities .
she argued that those cities are un@@ favourable to human survival .
for instance , Jane Jac@@ obs visited many CB@@ Ds specially .
she realized that CB@@ Ds were packed with workers at daytime yet empty at nights . no one stay in CB@@ Ds over night .
furthermore , many service providers , and small and middle @-@ sized companies as well , saw CB@@ Ds as opportunities .
thus , restaurants , print stores and laun@@ dries entered CB@@ Ds .
unfortunately , before long , restaurants , laun@@ dries and other service providers left CB@@ Ds .
why ?
everyone , do you know why ?
not only the high rents but also the periodic traffic in CB@@ Ds resulted in their withdrawal .
most people go to CB@@ Ds by day for work and leave after 5@@ pm .
look , this is a CB@@ D in Beijing , D@@ ab@@ ei@@ y@@ ao .
during the Chinese New Year holidays , D@@ ab@@ ei@@ y@@ ao keeps this status for ten days .
hence , a lot of small and middle @-@ sized companies in CB@@ Ds can generate revenue with high mark@@ ups , but they can only do it once a day .
restaurants , laun@@ dries and print stores can make money during days but have nothing to do at evenings and nights .
there are many small restaurants in urban residential areas .
those restaurants offers not only lun@@ ches but also dinners , midnight snacks and even break@@ f@@ asts .
the restaurants in CB@@ Ds realized that in spite of high profits the business hours is too short .
in other words , in terms of a special concept in the property development industry , their average revenue per unit area is too low .
Jane Jac@@ obs thought that was why the life in many American cities , such as Chicago and New York metropolitan area , was expensive but lifeless .
she also suggested that now that there are many streets and squares in cities and these streets and squares should serve workers by day and all citizens during non @-@ working hours , including the old and the young .
young adults could have a walk with their parents and kids on the streets or in the squares .
nevertheless , many streets have only one function , serving commu@@ ters .
they just lead commu@@ ters to office places .
cities have another feature .
this is a photo of the Red Square in Moscow taken by me .
we all know that every city has squares and squares play a special role in cities .
they are the embodiment of the city .
but Jane Jac@@ obs believed that many urban squares didn &apos;t fit in with human needs .
Mr Liang Sic@@ h@@ eng once said to Mao Zedong that the idea of Tian@@ anmen Square was viable , but the size was too big .
he reckoned that except for political purposes such a big square could not offer any benefits to ordinary citizens because it didn &apos;t meet human needs .
the Red Square is not big but still suitable for various military par@@ ades .
I took the photo with a wide angle lens .
if you visit the Red Square by person , you may be surprised by its small size .
it can &apos;t even rival any square in China .
but the Red Square is full of vitality , surrounded by plenty of ancient buildings .
don &apos;t you feel pleasant when you live in and walk around in the building ?
meanwhile , today &apos;s cities lay too many emphas@@ es on expressway which is prepared for vehicles .
what about pedestrians ?
what about bicycles ?
what about electric motorcycles ?
and what about motor@@ bikes ?
no , they are not the service objects of expressway .
the point is that many major expres@@ s@@ ways actually undermine the only remaining links in cities .
the Madrid of Spain built a ring expressway circling the old city .
many thought the ring expressway hindered the communication between residents .
say , a grandpa lived in this area , while his grandson lived in another area .
they couldn &apos;t visit each other as frequently as they used to do because of the ring expressway , thus leading to the weakening ties between families and friends .
the Madrid government responded to the public &apos;s appeal , removed the ring expressway and built an underground expressway so that the ties in the city was recovered .
there is an avenue in Shanghai which I regard as a failure , the Century Avenue .
if you go across the avenue , guess how long does it take ?
one minute .
Beijing built two avenues tra@@ vers@@ ing from east to west to achieve rapid transit .
one is Li@@ ang@@ guang Avenue ; the other is Ping &apos;an Avenue .
the two avenues were commercial zones of great significance in Beijing , for they went through Qi@@ anmen , Hu@@ gu@@ o Temple , Dru@@ m Tower and Bei@@ hai .
after the completion of the two avenues , however , all the shops along the two streets were going out of business ; they had few customers .
no one would pull over just for ice cream .
hence , have you noticed that the natural forms of an old city play an important role in our life ?
why do human need cities ?
Cheng @-@ shi , the Chinese counterpart of &quot; city &quot; consists of &quot; cheng &quot; which aims for confrontation and &quot; shi &quot; which is for cooperation . hence , the word &quot; city &quot; contains two mutually contradictory meanings .
hence , the word &quot; city &quot; contains two mutually contradictory meanings .
in ancient times , cities were built for confrontation , so buildings like the Great Wall , bar@@ bic@@ ans , Round City and Fujian T@@ ul@@ ou were built .
ancient human relied on cities to defend against enemy and survive .
therefore , the design logic behind ancient cities didn &apos;t take living quality into consideration .
the city of Chang &apos;an in Tang dynasty was a complex with many lanes and alleys .
it was a great city with many residents .
however , in fact the city was not appropriate for living .
it was a place accommod@@ ating imperial palaces , government organs and key figures , and some civilians .
did you see the two black dots here ?
what do they stand for ?
they were the only two markets with special permission in Chang &apos;an , the East Market and the West Market .
trading in other areas was forbidden so as to avoid terrorist attacks and safeguard the stable society .
this kind of city restricted human activities and stressed on defence .
the form of cities changed in Song dynasty .
the work , A@@ long the River During the Qing@@ ming Festival , show@@ cases the view of Di@@ an@@ li@@ ang . the city also had city walls but most lay@@ outs in the city were formed naturally .
what is the largest contributor to urban development ?
market economy .
market economy allows cities to grow at their will , though under the guideline of city planning .
but in a city which conforms to market economy , all walks of life , including ped@@ lars and men@@ ial servants , can build connection with others and the connection between people are close .
the most important criterion for a good city is that the city can lower the cost of cooperation and communication .
don &apos;t underestimate it .
if you live in different cities , your behavior varies with cities .
in a city where people are closely connected , you speak and behave in a corresponding way .
today &apos;s Shanghai has no city walls .
the only cities walls are in City God Temple and have been left unused for long .
Shanghai is the only city in China that develops on the basis of market economy and has few city walls .
thus , we can see that various activities take place in Wa@@ itan .
the life of Shanghai people is strongly tied to commerce , so the cost of their transportation and communication is lowered .
do you know the reason why people can maintain long @-@ term cooperation is not the value of individuals but the time they have spent together .
yes , admit it .
you cry after break@@ up due to your wasted time .
you love your children because of a great deal of time you have spent on them .
you cooperate with your business partner for long thanks to your trust over the time .
likewise , a nice city should have splendid history as its endorsement .
people feel a@@ we@@ struck in front of time @-@ honored historic buildings .
no one is arrogant on that occasion , for they will realize that the figures of much influence in the history are gone , so will they sooner or later .
hence , in that environment , people respect others and dispel the sense of superiority in reverence .
do those cities lack urban planning ?
of course not .
do cities develop naturally or artificially ?
I think their development are both natural and artificial .
for example , this is the downtown of ancient Roma .
you will see that ancient Roma was just roughly planned .
its government designed a central living room for the city so that residents could communicate in the city center , at the col@@ os@@ se@@ um or bath@@ houses .
I have to mention someone , Le Cor@@ busi@@ er .
people who study architecture view him as a great architect .
that &apos;s un@@ disputed .
yet , he made a fundamental mistake .
he participated in the formulation of the Athens Charter and expected to make cities functional in 19@@ 25 via the Athens Charter .
as you know , today &apos;s cities are functional ; they consist of CB@@ Ds , residential areas and administrative office areas .
all of them stem@@ med from the Athens Charter .
Le Cor@@ busi@@ er expected to industri@@ alize citizens in this way and offer convenience to vehicles , so he though everything should make the way for expressway .
this is the Paris that Le Cor@@ busi@@ er planned .
he hoped to build a vehicle @-@ friendly Paris where all residents live in high rises .
the city should have a great number of skyscrapers and green belts ; that was the ideal city for Le Cor@@ busi@@ er , which fitted in with a era of vehicles and industry .
luckily , his plan was denied , or we would never have today &apos;s Paris .
but his idea of functional city has affected architects , for at least a century .
a real well @-@ performing city should be diversified .
I don &apos;t go against functional areas , but I think it is more important to integrate residential areas , living areas , office areas and commercial areas to decrease the cost of transportation and communication as much as possible , or to gain the most with the least cost .
the solution to traffic jam is not just traffic dispersion or the construction of parking lots .
the problem of traffic jam lies in urban design .
therefore , the problem of cities is actually the problem of designers .
OK , let &apos;s have a look at the cities in China .
I visited Yin@@ chuan , Ningxia one year .
it is a city with small population , but roads there have ten lanes .
most lanes are in idle .
I visited De@@ zhou , a town of Yin@@ chuan .
to my surprise , there are roads with 12 lanes .
well , the local authority may be proud of it ; those cities seem to be able to rival Shanghai and Beijing with their wide roads .
but those cities are full of competition .
can you see any cooperation from its urban design ?
hence , I would like to point out that the reason why we preserve ancient buildings is not only they are the carrier of memory and feelings but also they are related to our daily life .
I just came back from the University of Pennsylvania in the US .
the more than 200 @-@ year @-@ old campus retains all ancient buildings .
in the university , people respect the truth and look forward to the future because of history .
plus , if a city makes money by demol@@ ishing old buildings and selling new ones , what kind of craf@@ ts@@ manship can you expect from the city ?
let &apos;s say , a man has bought a new house , and the appreciation of the new house largely exceeds the income he earns by hard working .
if the return on one @-@ hundred @-@ year hard working were less than the appreciation of one @-@ square @-@ meter property , do you think there would be craf@@ t@@ smen in the society ?
craf@@ t@@ smen are not fostered by roman@@ ticism but systems .
without time @-@ honored streets and lanes , without historical herit@@ ages , where can artis@@ ans go ?
above all , it is historical herit@@ ages that offers citizens the opportunities to communication .
do you know what differs culture from civilization ?
ah , in the English word &quot; culture , &quot; the pre@@ fix &quot; cult &quot; means harvest .
and in the term &quot; civilization , &quot; what does the pre@@ fix &quot; civil &quot; mean ?
it means citizens or urban dwellers .
so , the most significant difference between modern society and agricultural society lies in citizens .
citizens should participate in public affairs .
but without the room for public affairs , how can citizens participate in public affairs ?
one characteristic of the Chinese is that we pay much attention to household affairs and state affairs .
well , about household affairs , we may be clear how much a wash@@ basin is sold or how much cheaper are eggs .
as for state affairs , we may talk about the change of the Pol@@ it@@ bur@@ o Standing Committee , the war in Syria and the ambition of North Korea .
but do you have the awareness of public space ?
audiences , how many of you have attended owners &apos; meetings ?
do you know the heads of the owner committees ?
a few know it .
how can we be citizens without attaching importance to public space ?
raising the awareness of public space depends on the environment and local authorities .
cities should provide citizens with leisure facilities .
otherwise , without living space or public space where people communicate with others , cities would only be connected to families .
do you think this will happen to Spain ?
Spain has been building Cast@@ ells ( human towers ) for 400 years .
building Cast@@ ells has requirements for venues . and at those venues , the Spanish look back to the past and look forward to the future .
the city wall in Xi &apos;an is known to all , but do you know how the city wall was retained ?
it is an absurd story .
when the city wall was about to be torn down , the head of the Northwest Bureau in Xi &apos;an voiced an objection and claimed that the city wall could resist nuclear bombs .
and the senior leadership believed the claim , so the city wall survived .
during the Cultural Revolution , the city wall was in danger again and survived again .
do you know why ?
at that time , all universities , colleges and mining companies were carrying out revolution , so there was no access to large equipment , or even no one could operate large equipment .
those who were capable were the target of the Red Gu@@ ards .
thus , the Red Gu@@ ards tried knocking down the city wall with sp@@ ades and pick@@ axes .
the Red Gu@@ ards were aggressive to persons but posed few threats on buildings , which is a good thing .
after digging the city wall for days , the Red Gu@@ ards found the city wall was too solid to be demolished , so they gave it up at last .
that &apos;s the second survival of the city wall in Xi &apos;an .
fortunately the city wall was retained ; the city wall has became a major tourism revenue resource of Xi &apos;an .
the city wall , along with the mo@@ at , contributes 25 % to the annual tourism income of Xi &apos;an .
ancient buildings are valuable .
the following story is very irritating to me .
Mr Yu Yang , a senior actor , was going to Jinan by train for business .
on the way , someone said : &quot; we have arrived . &quot;
Mr Yu Yang said : &quot; no , we haven &apos;t . &quot;
why did he say so ?
he said : &quot; I know Shandong like a book . the Jinan Railway Station was originally built by F@@ is@@ cher . it has an amazing bell tower . the bell tower with a large roof which looks like a hat is very beautiful . I haven &apos;t the bell tower yet , so we can &apos;t be at the Jinan Railway Station . &quot;
yet , the man told him the old railway station has been torn down .
on hearing that , Mr Yu Yang froze at his seat , completely dum@@ b@@ founded .
why was the old railway station removed ?
in 1992 , Jinan was going to expand its railways .
but there was little room for expansion .
over the strong objections of experts and scholars , the then leadership of Jinan and the Ministry of Rail@@ ways still decided to tear down the old railway station .
a leader even said that the &quot; green hat &quot; built by Germans always reminds him of the invasion of the world led by Hitler , which was humiliating .
as a result , the former largest railway station in Asia was destroyed and replaced due to an in@@ advisable decision .
don &apos;t sign .
it is lucky that he didn &apos;t work in Shanghai , or the buildings at Wa@@ itan would be such a big humiliation to him .
someone may ask about the reasons for protecting old buildings , now that old buildings don &apos;t meet the needs of modern life .
let me answer the question .
Mr Yu Qi@@ u@@ yu told me that he met someone who used to live in an old building .
the man said : &quot; you call for the protection of ancient buildings all the time but do you know the inconvenience of living in old buildings .
why don &apos;t you live in an old building which has neither toilets nor sufficient water supply and is scor@@ ching hot in summer ?
you want to protect old buildings for the aesthetic value , but the old building leads to our poor and pathetic life .
I can &apos;t wait to demol@@ ish it . &quot;
quite a few people agree with the view .
but , actually , old buildings are never the root of poverty .
an elabor@@ ately restored old building are valuable assets , even high net @-@ worth assets .
I am a host of the programme , &quot; Dream Home , &quot; at the Dragon TV .
my biggest task is to visit old buildings and restore and enhance them as much as possible with designers .
can we enhance the sewerage ?
can we improve toilets ?
can we give a new look to the old buildings ?
the reconstruction of old buildings offers people new living environment which presents the memory of the past as well as the outlook on the future .
don &apos;t resent buildings ; don &apos;t resent old buildings .
they are not the obstacles to better life .
Shi@@ k@@ umen is rare in Shanghai now , and the number of shi@@ k@@ umen will keep decreasing with the development of Shanghai .
all my friends who came to Shanghai would praise the city for the high rises .
Shanghai dwellers would ex@@ claim over the great changes in Shanghai .
but they can &apos;t think of anything to say except for the praises for the city 。
because they find the development of Shanghai is hardly related to their daily life .
civilization is based on the premise of respecting culture .
in the end , I would like to share three say@@ ings with you to reconsider the definition of culture and civilization .
the cooperation in a city originates from the city &apos;s respect for its history .
only in a city which respects the past can citizens communicate rationally .
yet , author@@ itarianism and extreme con@@ su@@ mer@@ ism undermine human reason .
in the city where con@@ su@@ mer@@ ism and author@@ itarianism co @-@ exist , human reason must be weak , so people there focus more on competition than cooperation .
Nor@@ bert Eli@@ as had three arguments about culture and civilization .
he deemed culture made people distinctive while civilization made people alike .
culture runs through your veins , so you can grasp it without study .
and your behavior reflects your culture .
civilization requires learning and practice .
culture remembers history , while civilization looks forward to the future .
I hope that our culture and civilization can be highly united .
thank you !
hi , I &apos;m Tan Jian@@ feng .
my topic today may make you a little nervous .
OK , let &apos;s get started , now .
do you know him ?
the story of Edward S@@ now@@ den brings cyber@@ security into our focus .
it really matters to us .
we used to think that security was the business of the country and the government , not the citizens .
I &apos;d like to tell you now .
it is our business , indeed .
here are some figures .
recently , the news of credit card insecurity has been spreading in We@@ Chat Mom@@ ents .
you may have also seen many of such posts .
in particular , there is a striking headline , &quot; A Verification Code Can Ru@@ in You . &quot;
let me tell you .
your cellphone is not safe , because danger could come from text messages .
because there are telecom sc@@ ams .
let &apos;s take a look at some figures released at the China Internet Conference last year .
the direct loss of insecure phones is RMB 8@@ 0.@@ 5bn , and this figure is for China alone .
at the end of 20@@ 14 , Inter@@ pol also released some figures , which were global .
for the first time , this figure exceeded the global total drug sales and reached USD 3@@ t@@ n .
this figure is the annual GDP of India in that year .
we call it &quot; black property . &quot;
let us return to figures of China .
according to the latest statistics in 20@@ 16 , do you know that every day , 5,000 @-@ 8,000 ph@@ ishing sites are updated , and every half day , the Chinese users click on them 100 million times ?
feel scared ?
what kind of device do you think you &apos;re using ?
Americans call it a time bomb , or a drug you can &apos;t quit because all it takes is five minutes , just five minutes .
look at this sentence .
in the age of big data , parents don &apos;t necessarily know their children better than businessmen do .
in 20@@ 14 , there was a case in the US .
a teenage girl went to Amazon &apos;s website in search of nail polish suitable for pregnant women , so Amazon sent her products for pregnant women based on big data analysis .
Amazon was sued by the girl &apos;s parents later , and the parents won .
why ?
when using big data , actually we expose our privacy .
according to the latest data from Harvard University , as long as someone has your gender , age and blood type information , they can find 8@@ 1.7 % of your privacy without knowing your name .
I have drawn a watch here .
I believe that many of you are using smart watches .
in fact , there are successful cases abroad , in which hackers use data from your smart watch &apos;s tilt angle to determine the password you entered at the ATM .
so , is bi@@ ometric verification safe ?
a lot of people now think bi@@ ometric verification is safe because the &quot; password &quot; are our body parts .
okay , answer this .
do you know the worst part about bi@@ ometric verification ?
in fact , bi@@ ometric verification is not safe .
maybe you believe that it is safe because your physical characteristics are unique .
however , all the online identity verification is achieved through comparison .
once that data is intercep@@ ted , it &apos;s gone .
if you are blessed with twelve fingers , you have two more chances than others .
but can you afford to have endless plastic surgery in South Korea ?
last year , a star &apos;s house was stolen by a driver through face scanning .
here is an offline example .
guys , keep your cell phone in a safe place while you &apos;re sleeping or drinking too much .
why ?
many phones are now powered on by fingerprints .
when you fall asleep or drink too much , someone else can unlock it .
what &apos;s more , if he has malicious intentions , he / she can store his / her fingerprints on your phone , and then , he / she can check your phone at any time .
this is offline security .
security is even harder to ensure online .
bi@@ ometric verification is not as safe as you might think .
in fact , bi@@ ometric verification should be used locally , such as your home entrance , or the arm@@ ory and bank vault you see in popular American movies .
your fingerprints are not uploaded .
you may ask why your fingerprints are usually collected when going abroad .
that is for counter @-@ terrorism .
your fingerprints will not be uploaded to the internet .
so , remember , the cyberspace is not safe .
especially after you upload your unique biological characteristics onto the Internet , sorry , there is no security for you at all on the Internet .
the future is the era of big data .
the internet is inseparable from cell phones , computers and other devices that inter@@ connect every details of our life .
people should pay attention to safety , and start from the devices around .
a camera attached to an AP@@ P could make your life a live stream .
everybody &apos;s using We@@ Chat .
it can figure out your friends , your friends &quot; friends and draw a clear map of your friend circle .
Ali@@ baba can analyze your income , your investments and your shopping habits .
Baidu knows where you went if you are using its AP@@ P .
big data brings us a lot of convenience , but we also need to remind ourselves that the convenience is achieved at the cost of exposing our privacy .
security and convenience are incompatible , at least for now .
people in the cyber@@ security industry have been working on it .
convenience doesn &apos;t necessarily mean security .
convenience probably means no secrets .
what we ordinary people care about the most is not the secrets , but the money in our pockets .
black property is now eye@@ ing on your money , not the information in your text message .
for hackers , there is no absolute security .
accidents happen all the time .
our real online world is actually un@@ protected .
this picture is a good illustration of the current state of the internet .
our internet is a mir@@ age built on a desert .
Internet gives us a lot of convenience , but we don &apos;t have the control over the underlying core technology .
by April 20 , China had been connected to the internet for exactly 22 years .
without core technology , we are now faced with many problems .
on April 19 , President Xi held a symposium on cyber@@ security and talked about the need to strengthen the research and development of core technologies and put our products and core technologies into use .
only then can we have a chance to improve our present situation .
he who knows not how to fight knows not how to defend .
I &apos;ve spent a little bit of time today talking about some really scary things .
I would like to give you some tips .
first of all , did you bind credit cards to e @-@ bank ?
if so , I am sorry to inform you that it is only a matter of time before your card is h@@ acked .
you may be familiar with HT@@ T@@ PS if you use the internet .
the &quot; S &quot; part is closely related to your bank account .
it is for an Op@@ pen@@ SS@@ L function , called Sec@@ ure Soc@@ ket Layer .
the &quot; Hear@@ t@@ bleed &quot; bug in 20@@ 14 resulted in the theft of databases from many Chinese websites , including a well @-@ known website based in Shanghai .
media said that people who had booked hotel or tickets on that website should replace their credit card .
why ?
it &apos;s very simple .
take a piece of paper and a pen , write down your credit card number and the three @-@ digit check code .
take the credit card away .
can you pay online with this paper ?
the answer is yes .
of course , you can .
many websites record your card number and check code to provide you with convenient services .
recently you must hear of the news .
SMS verification codes are also insecure , or we should say , it is not safe at all .
here is a tip .
if you are binding a credit card to e @-@ bank , choose one with lower quota to reduce the risk .
in fact , cyber@@ security work is to reduce the risk , because risks can never be eliminated .
in addition , I believe that many of you are using your credit card on PO@@ S terminals .
I suggest you cancel the password you use on PO@@ S terminal consumption .
people may ask , &quot; Is@@ n &apos;t it unsafe not to have a password ? &quot;
I think people who have a credit card usually have a Visa or Master card as well .
if you have spent some time or bought things abroad , you will find that you are only required to enter your password when swi@@ ping a Uni@@ on@@ Pay card .
visa or Master card consumption does not require a password , is it right ?
am I right ?
well , what I &apos;m trying to tell you is that it &apos;s actually safer to not have a password .
and thirdly , everybody is using cell phone .
many have two .
let me tell you the right way to use two phones at the same time .
I &apos;m not talking about two internet @-@ connected phones that handle work and personal affairs separately .
you can use one phone to surf the internet .
do not put your contacts or sensitive photos in it .
and use another phone with no internet access to make calls .
put your address book in the second phone .
why ?
I believe that many of you have heard of the nude picture scandal of Hollywood stars . the photos were leaked in early 2015 .
as long as your phone is connected to the internet , it can &apos;t keep secrets .
these three tips are to let you know that cyber@@ security is a contradiction .
there is no absolute safety , and there is no absolute safe technology .
technology is always ancillary .
don &apos;t assume that anti@@ virus software will keep your computer safe .
it &apos;s like the human body .
which appeared first , vaccines or viruses ?
therefore , technology can only be an aid .
promoting cyber@@ security requires raising the security awareness of the whole nation .
I am hoping that you can pass this to more people around you , especially the elderly .
no matter who you are , no matter it is text message or We@@ Chat message , do not click on an un@@ confirmed link .
just don &apos;t .
your phone may have been hit by a Tro@@ jan , and you just don &apos;t know it .
if Tro@@ jan Horse virus is on your phone , the credit card number and password you enter will be sent to the h@@ acker .
after the Eigh@@ teenth National Congress of the CPC , President Xi has said : &quot; without cyber@@ security , there is no national security . without information@@ ization , there will be no modernization . &quot;
cyber@@ security is the foundation .
only by consolidating cyber@@ security can the infinite prospect of internet development be realized .
the road ahead is long .
we will and we have to embrace the internet , but we have to be vigilant all the time , too .
you can use the internet , but you need to be careful .
remember , your data is also your property .
thank you !
Brad Pitt and Angel@@ ina Jolie , filed for divorce .
some of my friends seemed more affected by the sudden shock than Pitt and Jolie .
what can we expect of marriage anymore ?
can we continue to have faith in it ?
the reason why they broke up , as the media has revealed , is disagreement over parenting .
God !
if you look around you , you will find nine out of ten couples have disagreement over it .
in my view , comparatively speaking , Shanghai men do a better job in this regard .
the northern men are b@@ ossi@@ er at home , who sometimes bring workplace pressure home and become a &quot; nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ist &quot; at home .
Shanghai men disagree with their wife too .
but if they and their wife could not reach an agreement , they are usually more willing to make concessions .
after all , the wife gives birth to the baby .
just step back and think from a broader perspective .
generally speaking , disagreement over parenting can be resolved by concessions made by one or both sides .
however , in the case of Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang , no man , not even Shanghai man , can tolerate the disgrace .
therefore , on the Internet , netiz@@ ens have all rallied around Wang , with topics like # Wang@@ Don@@ t@@ C@@ ry .
we see many We@@ Chat posts of cute babies , with topics like # my baby just turned three months and a bunch of cute baby photos .
some girls may call themselves &quot; baby &quot; and make a We@@ Chat Mom@@ ent with topics like # Baby in a bad mood .
God !
one of my doctoral students ,
who is taller than me , will make a We@@ Chat Mom@@ ent with topics like # Baby stay strong or # Baby don &apos;t cry right after he was criticized for his dissertation and a group of people will &quot; like &quot; and &quot; comment &quot; on the post .
it seems that our society is now so infanti@@ li@@ zed that the entire society succum@@ bs to child@@ like behaviors and dis@@ courses .
so my argument is that Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang divorce incident is more than a simple celebrity divorce scandal .
it signi@@ fies a societal change in our core ethical entities .
some of us may still remember the Peng Yu case in Nanjing that year .
it was more than an individual dispute .
after the case ,
in the post@@ - Peng Yu @-@ case era ,
there was a fundamental change in the ethical principles within the whole society .
my argument today is that the Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang case had the same impact .
one of my friends , who is an entrepreneur ,
told me that he immediately un@@ fri@@ ended a few people suspected of becoming &quot; Song Z@@ he &quot; after this incident .
I think he was truly afraid .
many people , for example my friend , despite their success in the society .
can become a victim at any time , another Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang and the person piti@@ ed by others .
this is what I call the post @-@ Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang era .
many of us will agree that love and trust are the two foundations of a marriage .
so what happened in the post @-@ Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang era ?
let us first talk about trust in the post @-@ Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang era .
why is trust so important ?
there is no doubt trust is important .
there is a fundamental issue concerning trust , that is , it includes risks , the risks of being betrayed .
let us give you a simple example .
suppose you are going to go on a business trip for two days
and ask one of your friends or neighbors to take care of your dog for you .
in this case , you can do nothing but trust him and will take care of your dog properly .
however , what if he fails your trust ?
what if he deliberately star@@ ves your dog ?
the dog cannot complain , right ?
your friend may do it un@@ intentionally , he may simply have forgotten .
trust means you have no choice but to believe that he will keep his promise .
in modern society ,
law and political science provide a way to avoid such a risk of trust by signing a contract between the two parties , forming a contractual relationship .
if one side breaks the promise , there will be a legal consequence .
however , apparently it is impossible to use a contract to avoid risks in every situation .
the society cannot function without trust .
the cost of cooperation become un@@ reasonably high .
imagine a wife has to check all the phone records , Q@@ Q and We@@ Chat messages , bank and Ali@@ pay transfer records of her husband every day ,
this kind of life is unthink@@ able .
therefore , the most fundamental role of trust is to help you remove the burden of constant checking up the others .
Fuk@@ u@@ y@@ ama , one of my favorite scholars ,
said that China is a low trust society .
a key sign of a low @-@ trust society is that people trust only their family members , the immediate family members .
more than 70 % of the privately @-@ owned companies are family @-@ owned companies .
with the wife or mother of the owner as the finance manager .
we do not trust others .
the same goes with the owner of larger companies , for example Wang Jian@@ lin .
he also wishes to hand over the company to his son , Wang Sic@@ ong .
we do not know whether he will have his wish come true yet , but it is a clear that this is a family @-@ managed company .
which shows little trust for outsiders .
Fuk@@ u@@ y@@ ama is very worried about such a mode .
as an old saying goes ,
wealth does not last beyond three generations .
why ?
if you use only family members .
you will not be able to introduce other talents into your company .
this is why wealth does not last beyond three generations
after the Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang divorce scandal , the situation has worsened .
I call it from low trust to no @-@ trust .
our trust towards the nuclear family members is ruined .
besides the Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang incident , there was another similar case , the cheating scandal of Zhang J@@ iz@@ hong &apos; wife .
both Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang and Zhang J@@ iz@@ hong have their own companies and both of their wives were placed in the most critical position because they do not trust outsiders .
but sati@@ ric@@ ally , the biggest hit came from the inside , from those who were most close to them .
so the first question is in the post@@ - Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang @-@ divorce era , do you still have the courage to enter marriage ?
do you still have the courage to trust your spouse who sleeps next to you ?
this is the question for us .
similarly , do you still have the courage to fall in love again ?
are you still willing to love again ?
from a psycho@@ analysis perspective .
let us first analyze what is love and what is not .
in fact ,
in many intimate relationships ,
we mistake many other things as love .
a female friend of mine , who is a celebrity in Shanghai .
had many failed intimate relationships and was wounded time after time .
however , she told me that she still believes in love .
she said she does not care whether the other party owns a car , a property , or has a deposit .
all she cared is how she feels towards him , whether she has a crush for him .
this thinking is pure , right ?
however , is this love ?
we need to ask this question first .
why do we have a crush for someone ?
in psycho@@ analysis , there is a term called fantasy .
what does it mean ?
it means that we have a pre@@ conceived notion of an ideal partner in our mind , or a fantasy scene .
this fantasy scene may be shaped by the culture we live in .
nowadays , a prince charming may look like a South Korea celebrity with single eyelid or a young character with a high nose from a Hollywood movie .
or a mature and consider mid @-@ aged man , like Wu Xi@@ u@@ bo , who happens to share my su@@ r name .
this is quite interesting .
with this pre@@ conceived image in the mind .
if we meet someone who very much resembles Wu Xi@@ u@@ bo , we will irresis@@ ti@@ bly have a crush on him and fall in love with him .
in many cases , love @-@ at @-@ first @-@ sight actually can be explained by fantasy .
however , fake love goes nowhere .
it does not last .
why ?
because even Wu Xi@@ u@@ bo is a different person from the characters that he played on screen .
what we see are scrip@@ ted characters played by him .
suppose you are in a romantic relationship with Wu Xi@@ u@@ bo himself , not a substitute who resembles him .
your experience of living together will soon fly in the face of his &quot; good man &quot; image .
you will begin to doubt whether you were blind to have chosen such a man and live with him .
this is why the romantic relationship of many celebrity couples do not last , ah , be it in Hollywood or in China .
the question is the same .
it is not because they have all met a morally bad person .
for example , Chen He and Wen Zhang , although their wives are beautiful , this still does not stop them from cheating on their wife .
why ?
in fact , a perfect lover is only perfect because of the distance between you two .
if you are together all the time , you see him or her with morning breath and un@@ washed face .
you will soon find him or her not perfect anymore .
she may look like a tired woman who has past her prime .
in addition , she may be a little spoiled , not easy to live with .
this is what will happen if we mistake fantasy as love , unhappiness and heart broke .
what is my suggestion on how to distinguish between fantasy and true love ?
my suggestion is love at the second sight .
love at first sight is unreliable .
fon@@ dness from familiarity cannot be considered as love at all due to the practical considerations involved .
what is love at the second sight ?
after you have been with each other for some time .
you will come to see many of his / her shortcomings .
you may find it hard to bear some his shortcomings , but you still love him / her .
this may be true love .
this is called love at the second sight .
psycho@@ analysis offers another way to tell what is true love .
that is to say , if you really love someone .
your first thought at the sight of him / her is not a sexual one .
he / she does not immediately arouse your sexual desire .
love and sex , or desire , are two completely unrelated channels .
when one switch is turned on .
the other is automatically turned off .
many of the men who are here today may have the same feeling .
we lose heartbeat over a look , a smile , and a fli@@ pping of hair of our beloved .
if a bunch of men gossip about the chest and hip size of a woman .
they have definitely not fallen in love with her .
I have to refer back to the friend of mine here , the celebrity in Shanghai .
she had any failed romantic relationships but she still believed in love .
I never told her my understanding about why so many of her relationships did not work .
she has a great personality and attractive appearance .
how comes she had so many failed relationships ?
as I see it , she herself is one of the reasons , or her cultural identity in specific .
she loves to wear clothes that are rather closely fitting and would look sexy in even a suit .
she surely has the capital to dress so .
however .
the problem is I was there with her at several parties and have seen the looks of many men on her .
she always has many pursu@@ ers .
the problem is how to make the relationship last .
are these men she met all bad people ?
of all the relationships , has she never met a good guy ?
some of her previous boy@@ friends got married later .
but not with her .
so here is a piece of advice for girls , the way you dress is more important than you think .
not all boys are bad guys .
but the way you dress may determine which switch is turned on and which is automatically turned off .
this is the conflict between love and desire .
so , what is love ?
you may agree with me being in love means being in an unusual state .
the very expression &quot; fall in love &quot; suggests this is a state that we have no control over .
all of a sudden , you meet someone , your heart beats faster ,
you have no thought for tea or rice , and you are out of your mind .
if you are a researcher like me , you may forget about your unfinished thesis completely .
in most cases , you do not act this way because you want to .
it is as if a force controls you .
your beloved is all over your mind .
it is impossible to focus and work .
on the other hand , desire is more related to our biological instinct .
one night stand is a common thing for young people in the cities .
in the morning , they put on their clothes , and go back to work .
there is no impact on their normal life .
this is desire .
a completely different thing from love .
but the problem today is that more and more urban youth choose to avoid love and pursue desire .
no one will be very envious of Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang , who married Ma R@@ ong , the first girl he ever loved .
however , many people will envy Chen Gu@@ anxi secretly even though they may still call him a bad guy .
why fewer and fewer people embark on the road of love ?
because there is price for love .
in love , we expose our vulner@@ abilities to each other .
love entails an absolute trust between each other .
we just talked about trust .
but trust does not necessarily include love .
we can also trust our friends or family members .
on the other hand , love means an absolute trust .
let us think about what we are like when we are in love .
when you love someone .
you give him the absolute power to destroy you .
back to the case of Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang , I am no fan for gossi@@ ps .
but I do think Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang really loved Ma R@@ ong and had absolute trust towards her .
that Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang suffered so much is not such a pity .
this is the price for love , the risk of love .
the key question to aks is that in this post @-@ Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang era .
are you still willing to fall in love again ?
would you rather be Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang who had loved and got heart@@ broken or Edison Chen who had many girl@@ friends and lived a happy life ?
this is a question for us to think about today .
as we have discussed , the first thing we mistake for love is fantasy .
the second is desire .
the third thing is even more familiar to us , material well@@ being .
the talk is no more than a pl@@ ati@@ tude , so familiar to most of us .
marriage is actually about selling ourselves at a good price .
in dating , many people will indirectly en@@ quire the other side whether he / she owns a property or has the deposit for the down payment .
why have dating platforms become so popular and successful ?
in my view , it is because they have completely norm@@ alized what we did indirectly in the past .
when we search for a match on the platform .
we will condition the target to someone who is taller than 1.@@ 75 meters and owns a property and a car .
those who are shorter than 1.@@ 70 meters will be ruled out from the target groups .
what about those without a property ?
you no longer need to ask about it indirectly in dating .
the search engine will do the job for you .
our life is a bald commerci@@ alization .
this is quite similar to shopping online .
what you do on a dating website is similar to shopping on Ta@@ obao .
there is no big difference .
in both cases , we first search for what we want by keywords .
then , we browse the search results one by one .
in addition , in both cases ,
we choose by looking at the pictures and reading the textual introduc@@ tions and we have to pay for it .
in the case of &quot; shopping &quot; on a dating platform , we pay for the &quot; stamps , &quot; the chance to meet the one we have picked .
this is in every sense a process of selling ourselves .
by registering on such a platform ,
we are putting ourselves on the shelves ,
same as other products .
this is a common practice in our time .
we have so many dating services , dating live shows , and dating websites .
but we are actually drifting farther and farther away from love .
will a marriage without love and trust work ?
if we look around ,
we may find examples of marriages based on material needs or marriages in which two people choose to marry each other to take what he / she needs from the other party .
maybe one party in the relationship wants beauty and the other wants money .
there is a chance that such a relationship will last and will not break the way Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang &apos;s did .
so , I call it a personal choice .
you are aware of the possibility that this marriage may last or end at any time for the same reason it began .
for example ,
if you or your partner meet someone richer or more beautiful .
as Ma R@@ ong met Song Z@@ e , who do look more handsome than Bao@@ q@@ iang .
you may become another Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang .
as we have discussed today , love and marriage are in systematic conflict .
love is an abnormal state
while marriage is a normal state .
so how do you norm@@ alize an abnormal state ?
it takes works ,
many extraordinary efforts .
the year before last year , there was a very good movie called G@@ one Girls , directed by David Fin@@ ch .
there is a line in it , &quot; you can &apos;t get lazy . &quot;
do not ever get lazy in marriage .
do not stop spending time and energy on it .
in this psycho@@ analysis , we believe , as you may agree or disagree , separation is the natural tendency .
if you do not make deliberate efforts , separation is inevitable .
we choose to come together .
this is a deliberate choice .
it takes efforts to stay together .
Al@@ ain B@@ adi@@ ou , a contemporary French philosopher , once said , &quot; loyalty to love makes us subjects . &quot;
we do not directly become subjects .
it is through ethics , time , and especially loyalty to love that we become so .
today we analyzed the vulnerability and risks of love in the post @-@ Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang era .
love may lead you to something worse than what Wang Bao@@ q@@ iang had experienced .
however , whether to believe in love again is a personal choice , your own choice for your life .
find the answer by yourselves .
thank you !
hello , everyone .
I &apos;m glad to make a speech here and share with you my views on the topic today .
please let me introduce myself first .
I &apos;m Tang Yin@@ gh@@ ong , a father of an 18 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
and I &apos;m a column@@ ist for psychology , the founder of Psy@@ E@@ yes , and also a we @-@ media writer .
my daughter asked me a question about half a year ago , &quot; Dad , will you force me to find a boyfriend or get married in the future ? &quot;
I was surprised at the time .
for my part , I have never thought that I will intervene in my daughter &apos;s life when she is a grown @-@ up .
never thought about it .
but I can understand my daughter &apos;s concerns .
because her friends , relatives , TV series and online discussions are all sending her a message that young people like her are placed in a situation that their parents will force them to get married someday .
so today we will discuss , is it a common scene in China that parents tend to force their children to get married ?
T@@ ec@@ ent &apos;s news program &quot; F@@ acts &quot; launched a survey last month .
the survey was designed to find out Chinese views on love and marriage .
one set of data in the survey reflects the situation of parents forcing their children to marry nowadays .
the result showed that among the over 10,000 single people who were surveyed , 70 % of whom were once forced to get married by their parents .
I also conducted a similar survey on my official We@@ Chat account .
which also confirmed such a result .
among hundreds of readers surveyed , 69 % of the respondents revealed that they were urged to get married .
from the perspective of social psychology .
we can explain this phenomenon in part from the perspective of the collec@@ tiv@@ ist culture represented by Chinese people and the individu@@ alistic culture represented by the American people .
OK , let &apos;s continue .
then in this individu@@ alistic culture represented by the United States .
there is a clear boundary between self and others .
the relationship between parents and children are no exception as well .
so what are the rights of parents ?
and what are the rights of children ?
parents and children will respect each other &apos;s rights within the boundary .
in the culture of collec@@ ti@@ vism , there is no clear boundary between children and parents , self and others .
parents and children are in fact closely related to and emotionally dependent on each other .
it can be seen that in China not only parents tend to force their children to get married .
but in turn , grown @-@ up children sometimes interfere in their parents &apos; marriages .
in addition , the vast majority of the developing countries actually have a similar collec@@ tiv@@ ist culture to China .
the American movie called &quot; My Big Fat Greek Wed@@ ding &quot; shows that a Greek daughter &apos;s wedding is not just her own personal business .
but the business of her entire family .
its movie poster also typically represents such a scene .
in the collec@@ tiv@@ ist culture , there is a whole family behind the wedding for the bride .
then what does the groom who has been affected by the individu@@ alistic culture represent in the wedding ?
what is the role of the groom ?
just himself .
besides , we can also explain why Chinese parents are tending to force their children to marriage from other angles .
later we will talk about behavior with Chinese characteristics .
the culture of forcing children to get married is also with typical Chinese characteristics , which we can try to analyze .
first , from a psychological point of view .
Chinese parents are inclined to treat their children as an expansion of themselves rather than independent individuals .
therefore , they usually put their expectations , un@@ fulfilled wishes , un@@ eas@@ iness and fear on their children .
in their opinion , they have the responsibility to tell the children their experience in finding the life partner and give the guidance to their kids &quot; marriage .
or , to put it another way , if a Chinese couple didn &apos;t intervene in their child &apos;s marriage and their child married a bad one .
what does this mean to the couple ?
they will surely think they are responsible for the miserable marriage .
this explanation is from a psychological point of view .
secondly , from the angle of sociology , it is not just an option but an all @-@ too @-@ common scene for Chinese parents to intervene in their kids &quot; marriage , under the current social background .
Chinese parents are used to it .
kids are always an eternal topic when Chinese parents chat with their relatives , colleagues or neighbors .
if a pair of Chinese parents don &apos;t intervene in their children &apos;s private affairs , they would appear a bit weird compared with others .
yes , very weird .
therefore , for Chinese parents .
it &apos;s not whether they are willing to interfere in their children &apos;s marriage or not , then what is that ?
it is a must for them to do , as they have learnt such a custom under the current social system .
thirdly , we can probe into it from an economic point of view .
for most Chinese parents , &quot; to bring up children for the purpose of being looked after in old age &quot; is not just an ancient saying , but also a social reality for the time being .
whether it be parents of working @-@ class in urban areas or parents engaged in farming in rural areas .
they will only expect their children can take care of them and financially support them if their old @-@ age pensions cannot be guaranteed .
from this we can see that Chinese parents &quot; intervention in their children &apos;s marriage is .
in a sense , an attempt to ensure their quality later life .
it is especially for those who have done everything and almost spent all the money they have to bring up their children .
so what should they get in return ?
it should be the guarantee for their later years in life .
so undoubtedly , the marriage of their children is very important for them .
finally , we can demonstrate such a culture of forced marriage with Chinese characteristics from the perspective of political science .
in a sense , this kind of intervention and control by Chinese parents to their children is a reflection that their marriages were once affected more or less by the national policies in the past .
for most parents born in the 1950s or 1960s .
when they got their marriage registered at that time , they needed to show a letter of introduction from their working units .
and when they wanted to get divorced , their working units would also act as a medi@@ ator .
of course , you don &apos;t need such kinds of stuff anymore when registering marriage now
and only nine yuan will enable you to get a marriage certificate at the local civil affairs bureau .
but 30 years ago .
a letter of introduction was a must for marriage registration .
apart from this , the national policies also affected their child@@ bearing plans .
it was the couple &apos;s responsibility and obligation to observe the family planning policy at that time . the nation would control how many children they have , the method of contraception and when they have children .
that &apos;s why I said Chinese parents &quot; intervention in their children &apos;s marriages is a sort of reflection that their marriages were once affected more or less by the national policies in the past .
in fact , the culture of forced marriage in China may sometimes make people in other countries of collec@@ tiv@@ ist culture jaw @-@ dropping .
let me give you a familiar example . there is a famous match @-@ making corner in Shanghai &apos;s People &apos;s Park .
I visited there yesterday .
in fact , the match @-@ making corner was packed with elderly parents looking for suitable boy@@ friends / girl@@ friends for their kids , rather than young people looking for their destined loved ones .
not only in Shanghai , there are similar scenes in Chengdu and some other Chinese cities .
apparently , it is not just an intervention by parents . so what is it like ?
it is a participation in a &quot; game &quot; !
so what kind of Chinese parents are more inclined to actively take part in a &quot; game , more willingly to be involved in child &apos;s marriage ?
after all , not all Chinese parents favor such a practice .
in my opinion , the phenomenon of the marriage intervention or the forced marriage is more likely to occur under a kind of family structure .
that family structure is also shown in some familiar Chinese TV series .
it is an original family structure of mother @-@ dominance and father @-@ compromise .
in such a family structure , Chinese @-@ style forced marriage is more likely to take place .
from the perspective of sociology of culture .
the expectations for the role of traditional women are pretty much the same both in traditional Chinese and western cultures .
so what should a traditional woman look like ?
social norms require traditional women to be passive , tender , and obedient .
however , there are completely different social expectations for men .
what should men be like ?
they should be active , proactive , aggressive and brave .
but with the development of China over the past decades .
all people ( both men and women ) , in a sense , have been encouraged to develop passive , tender , gentle and obedient personalities .
relatively speaking , it will in turn suppress some of the personalities of being active , proactive or brave .
so in a family structure of a traditional strict father and gentle mother .
if the role of the strict father is suppressed , then the mother will naturally turn to be strict .
the reason why such a phenomenon occurs is that , from a biological point of view , women have the instinct of protecting their children .
it is not the case that women should be passive and tender as required by the traditional culture .
as such personalities are not naturally born but imposed on by the society .
as we all know , among most of the mammals in nature , the female mammals in their lac@@ tation period are far more aggressive and dangerous than the hungry male ones .
can you still remember in the movie &quot; The reven@@ ant &quot; what Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ ri@@ o encountered ? ( 此@@ 处@@ 演@@ 讲@@ 者@@ 应@@ 该@@ 是@@ 要@@ 说 《 荒@@ 野@@ 猎@@ 人 》 ( 20@@ 15@@ 年 ) ， 《 荒@@ 野@@ 生@@ 存 》 里@@ 没@@ 有@@ 迪@@ 卡@@ 普@@ 里@@ 奥 )
a lact@@ ating female bear .
therefore , human beings are no exception .
human beings are a species of mammals , and women are born with the instinct of protecting their children .
so when the role of the strict father is suppressed , what will be the role of mother ?
the mother will naturally turn to be strict in the family .
those popular Chinese TV dramas , in which there are ti@@ ger@@ like @-@ mothers and cat@@ like @-@ fathers , reflect such a phenomenon to a large extent .
here comes the problem . most of the young people may feel so frustrated about it .
then how can they prevent parents from forcing them to get married ?
in the survey conducted on my official We@@ Chat account , 69 % of the respondents revealed that they were once urged to get married by their parents .
another set of figures shows that around 70 % of the respondents said that they would never compromise or follow parents &quot; wishes to get married .
under such a condition , parents and children will come to a dead end .
as I mentioned before , under an original family structure of mother @-@ dominance and father @-@ compromise .
what kind of children are they more likely to bring up ?
in such a family structure , the daughter is very likely to acquire some characteristics of the mother and become dominant .
this kind of girls is called as &quot; tough girls &quot; nowadays .
and the son is probably to be raised to be a &quot; mama &apos;s boy &quot; or the so @-@ called &quot; giant baby . &quot;
my daughter is now a senior high school student , and it is common to see girls behave stronger than boys in high school classes .
we can imagine that if a girl brought up in such a family structure of a strong mother and a weak father mar@@ ries a boy from a similar family , then what will happen ?
they will again form a similar family structure that is a strong wife and a weak husband .
how can we get rid of this situation ?
so I &apos;d like to give some advice to young people from a psychological perspective .
this is the theory of communication analysis called P@@ AC in psychology .
it divides the communication or mutual influence between adults into three basic modes , namely P@@ AC .
P stands for P@@ arent , A for Ad@@ ult and C for Child .
though the P@@ AC theory generates from the family mode , it can not only be used for communication within the family .
but can also be widely used in interpersonal communication in workplaces and daily life .
so in a typical family structure , what kind of attitude do parents usually hold ?
a parent attitude .
if the parents have their own characteristics and attitudes , how should we communicate with them ?
the typical characteristic way of their communication is that they tend to ask you to do what they want you to do and you must do that .
they would never consider what you really feel .
then what attitude do children usually take when communicating with their parents ?
they usually deal with it in a child way .
the typical child way is that I hope , I wish or I beg other people to do something .
they don &apos;t make up their mind or set high requirements for themselves to do things in a better way .
instead , they just ask or wish their parents to give them more understanding or not to impose too much pressure on them .
they don &apos;t think about what they can do themselves .
the communication mode of adults is relatively mature .
so what are the characteristics of this communication mode compared with P and C ?
it is characterized by the fact that communic@@ ators will put themselves in others &quot; shoes , leaving adequate le@@ eway for each other .
if a pair of parents can communicate with their children in an adult way , things would turn much better .
although they might still give their children suggestions about marriage , it won &apos;t become a kind of pressure .
likewise , if children can deal with the forced marriage in an adult way .
they will talk to their parents calmly about their true feelings and thoughts while saying they totally understand parents &quot; good intention .
for most young people , they definitely know the good intentions of parents .
when I was a teacher in college .
I often asked my students , &quot; is there anyone who doesn &apos;t spend money of your parents ? &quot;
a scan@@ ty few .
almost all of them rely on their parents .
for instance , they need their parents to buy them a house or even afford a wedding .
so I told them , as an adult , you must know that since your parents have spent money on you ( no matter houses or wedding ) .
they are controlling shareholders and certainly have the right to voice their opinions on or even intervene in your affairs .
therefore , if parents and children communicate with each other in their own way ( P@@ arent @-@ way and Child @-@ way respectively ) , conflicts will undoubtedly occur and can &apos;t be solved .
then what to do ?
how to deal with it ?
first of all , parents or children must learn to use Ad@@ ult @-@ way to communicate .
then who is more likely to stand out to use Ad@@ ult @-@ way ?
obviously not parents , because they have developed their habits over the past decades and they have become accustomed to treating their children in the P@@ arent @-@ way .
then only the children take the lead in changing their roles , making themselves a mature adult and behaving like a grown @-@ up .
that is to say .
when you become mature .
you will be able to influence your parents .
in this model , the Ad@@ ult @-@ way is a mature communication way , while P@@ arent @-@ way or Child @-@ way is immature .
it should be clear that parents dominate in the parent @-@ child relationship when children are under@@ age .
and when they grow up , children should dominate in such a relationship .
when you become a mature adult as soon as possible .
you will have the chance to change the thoughts of your parents .
specifically speaking , you will be able to prevent the deep @-@ rooted culture of the forced marriage .
and you could also avoid becoming such a parent in the future .
in a sense , we should change the culture of the forced marriage , which is unreasonable and unfair to young people .
the key to changing it is in the hands of children ( young people ) rather than in the hands of parents .
only when you learn to communicate with your parents in an Ad@@ ult @-@ way and face the pressure imposed by parents as a mature grown @-@ up .
you may say you help yourself and your parents grow together .
thank you .
on April 4 , 20@@ 16 , 6 @-@ year @-@ old Zhu@@ ang@@ z@@ huang came to the hospital for a vaccine shot .
he was anxious , and soon , he burst into a rage of tears .
Zhu@@ ang@@ z@@ huang &apos;s mother told him over and over again : &quot; Zhu@@ ang@@ z@@ huang , come on out , we can go home after the shot . it &apos;s not as painful as you imagined . we can get ice cream on our way home . &quot;
not convinced by his mom , Zhu@@ ang@@ z@@ huang kept on crying , shaking his head and crou@@ ching under the table .
the mother @-@ and @-@ son stan@@ do@@ ff lasted over an hour .
my name is Cheng Qi , and I &apos;m a child life specialist .
in my daily work at the hospital , I help children like Zhu@@ ang@@ z@@ huang to overcome healthcare @-@ induced anxiety .
many parents and colleagues think that I am good with kids .
however , this doesn &apos;t mean that I possess any superpower .
but rather the fact that understanding and communicating with children is challenging for most people .
how should we talk to children then ?
the process of communication is similar to holding a ring of keys without knowing which one can make a child open up his or her heart .
I want to do a small poll here .
by a show of hands , who among you has a driver &apos;s license ?
who has attended CE@@ T @-@ 4 or CE@@ T @-@ 6 ?
I can see many people have driver &apos;s licenses and CE@@ T certificates
how many of you here have children ?
we must get a license to drive .
we think English is important .
therefore we sit the CE@@ T @-@ 4 and CE@@ T @-@ 6 exams .
let me ask you this one question : how many people here today have the certificate for parenting ?
isn &apos;t it scary to know that there is no qualification required for such a major responsibility ?
that &apos;s right .
we have not been systematically trained to be mothers and fathers .
therefore , people tend to freak out when they hit some stumbling blocks in child @-@ raising .
3 @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ anti@@ an &apos;s mother has been bothered by a problem .
September 1 was a new school year .
however , Ti@@ anti@@ an refused to go to the kindergarten .
she cried her heart out every day at home until she lost her voice .
Ti@@ anti@@ an &apos;s mother tried to reason with her , saying that mommy needs to work .
therefore , she must go to the kindergarten .
the mother went on explaining that at kindergarten , Ti@@ anti@@ an would have many toys and friends to play with , and the teachers there would love her very much .
her mother &apos;s words did not sit well with Ti@@ anti@@ an . in an emotional breakdown , she told her mom : &quot; I won &apos;t go to the kindergarten . I just don &apos;t want to ! &quot;
what should we do in this situation ?
we should play one more game first .
now please close your eyes .
imagine you are in an elevator .
you are going up one floor , two floors , and three floors .
suddenly it stops .
now , you are alone in the dark with no cell phone signals .
you can open your eyes .
how did you feel just now ?
you felt nervous and anxious .
that is exactly how the kids feel when they are in an unfamiliar setting , such as in a hospital or at school .
we call it the model of information processing in a strange environment .
it is like when you are in an elevator which comes to a sudden halt , and you have limited information about the situation .
the lack of information prov@@ okes a high degree of uncertainty .
when you have minimal control over how things are going , you will intu@@ iti@@ vely perceive the surrounding as threatening .
naturally , you will be under emotional stress .
at this time , someone appears and feeds you a lot of rational and logical information .
it &apos;s like two people are arguing , and then a third person jumps out and tries to end the fight .
is it helpful ?
not likely , as such problem @-@ solving method is inefficient .
what should we do when kids are in an environment they perceived as dangerous or when they are in a state of anxiety ?
what if your house is on fire .
what would you do ?
some parents will stand aside , attempting to figure out why the house caught fire in the first place .
will it help ?
no , it &apos;s counter@@ productive .
our priority should be to put out the fire .
what I am trying to tell you is that when children are emotionally anxious , we need to address their feelings first and foremost .
okay , let &apos;s go back to Ti@@ anti@@ an &apos;s case .
when her mother encountered such situation , she took my advice and told Ti@@ anti@@ an this : &quot; Ti@@ anti@@ an , I know you are nervous and don &apos;t want to go to the kindergarten . mommy is here ; I am right here with you . &quot;
Ti@@ anti@@ an was still upset at first .
after a while , she started to realize that her mother understood her feelings .
eventually , she cal@@ med down .
we have s@@ ooth@@ ed her .
that was the easy part .
when children are experiencing mood fluctuations , parents should console them and help them deal with their emotions .
what &apos;s the next step when the kids are stable ?
we need to find out the cause of the fire .
most of the children are able to describe the reasons behind their anxieties or worries , or at least , parents can figure it out themselves .
for example , kids will tell their mothers that they don &apos;t want to go to kindergarten because Ms. C@@ andy is so strict . &quot;
or they will say , &quot; Mom , I don &apos;t want to go to the hospital . I hate the smell of disinfec@@ tant . I am scared . &quot;
however , sometimes , parents need to prepare for the unexpected .
in July this year , Hu@@ an@@ huan &apos;s mother has reached out for my help .
Hu@@ an@@ huan used to be an ex@@ tro@@ vert .
however , he &apos;s been having difficulty in participating in group activities after recently getting enrolled in an international school .
the teachers and parents have encouraged him , given him more attention , care as well as praises , but he was still reluctant to join the others .
I started to talk to the kid .
as the session proceeded , he gradually opened up to me .
he told me he wanted to take part in those group events but was afraid that he might forget his mother tongue as he must speak English during the activities .
do you remember the story about the 6 @-@ year @-@ old Zhu@@ ang@@ z@@ huang I told you earlier ?
Zhu@@ ang@@ z@@ huang wasn &apos;t frightened by the needles .
as he later conf@@ ided to me that he feared the injection might drain his blood@@ 0 .
turning him into a vampire .
children are full of wild ideas that they are afraid of or don &apos;t know how to express .
it has reminded me of a cat@@ ch@@ phrase : my heart is hurting inside .
in cases like this , we encourage mothers to help their kids .
we have advised Ti@@ anti@@ an &apos;s mom to say .
Ti@@ anti@@ an , please don &apos;t cry , tell me what &apos;s wrong .
for kids that are eager to express .
we should allow them to speak up .
in some cases , it is the parents who are blocking their children &apos;s communication channels .
for instance , this summer , nine @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ lan came to the ER to seek treatment for a head wound .
Lan@@ lan &apos;s mother told the doctor that she wished her daughter to undergo local anesthesia rather than general anesthesia .
the doctor agreed , but articulated reservations that Lan@@ lan &apos;s nervousness may compromise the safety of the operation if she was locally anes@@ the@@ tized .
Lan@@ lan was indeed extremely anxious .
when I saw her , she curled up in the corner of the ER , shi@@ vering .
however , her mother said the following words .
Lan@@ lan , what &apos;s the matter ?
tell me now !
you know what , the pain is not that bad .
do you remember going to the dentist &apos;s the other day ?
that injection was really painful , and yet you have overcome it .
mommy trusts you . you can do this .
ignoring her mother , Lan@@ lan insisted that she wanted to go home .
I slowly walked towards Lan@@ lan and sat next to her .
then I started to talk to her .
under my guidance , she began to relax and speak to me .
I said to her : &quot; Lan@@ lan , I know you are scared . your body is shaking . I am worried about you . can you tell me what you are afraid of and how can I help you ? &quot;
bit by bit , she explained her concerns .
she said , &quot; Ms. Cheng , I fear the anes@@ thetic needle would poke my eyes blind , and then I won &apos;t be able to see anything . &quot;
upon knowing her worries , I cleared her concerns immediately .
she was relieved , saying that she wouldn &apos;t be nervous at all had she known that earlier .
she was sitting steady like a rock during the surgical su@@ ture later .
both her mother and I wanted to understand her fear and help her .
Lan@@ lan &apos;s mother asked what her problem was and urged Lan@@ lan to tell her .
what does this conversation sound like ?
it &apos;s like there are two fire@@ balls .
one is in exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating pain , and the other constantly asks him : &quot; how are you feeling ? tell me . tell me . &quot;
what will the first fire@@ ball think ?
it thinks : &quot; I &apos;m in a world of pain . why can &apos;t you see that ? &quot;
in the end , one refuses to talk , and the other is clu@@ eless .
their communication is going on a downward spiral .
I notice the audiences are laughing .
I think you have associated the story with lovers &apos; quarrel .
when the ladies are mad at something .
the guys will say , &quot; What &apos;s wrong honey ? just tell me . what do you want me to do ? you need to tell me ! &quot;
the more guys talk like this , the ang@@ rier the girls get .
now , they just give you the silence treatment , and the communication between the couple has broken down .
what would I do in this scenario ?
I would begin my sentences with &quot; I see , &quot; &quot; I noticed , &quot; &quot; I want to help you &quot; and &quot; I am worried . &quot;
the phrase &quot; what &apos;s wrong &quot; may make people feel uncomfortable , as it has a slight hint of accusation .
if you replace &quot; what &apos;s wrong &quot; with &quot; I noticed , &quot; it will bring the two parties closer in a conversation .
that is what we called the &quot; I Statement &quot; strategy .
so next time , when you encounter communication blocks with either your child or your partner , it &apos;s highly recommended that you should try the I Statement strategy .
I work at a hospital .
I see many kids coming to get injections or draw blood , or even have sur@@ ger@@ ies .
the process of medical counseling is the facilitation of communication .
as a child life specialist , my job is not only to help children to share their minds .
but often we are there to prevent or minimize pedi@@ atric healthcare @-@ induced anxiety and trauma .
I know that many psychological traum@@ as occur during childhood , and the wounds cut deep into our hearts beyond words .
many people have wondered why I choose this profession .
that is because I have been through a similar traumatic experience .
when I was in third grade , I was pushed into an operating room without anything explained to me beforehand .
I was strapped on the operating table , with a black mask over my face .
all I heard was the cl@@ ang@@ ing sound of the surgical instruments .
the doctor put me on local anesthesia and sed@@ ative .
one minute , five minutes , ten minutes , fifteen minutes passed , a nurse came over and asked me , &quot; Little girl , why aren &apos;t you asleep ? why are you still conscious ? &quot;
I did not answer her .
now in retrospect , her words were accus@@ atory .
it &apos;s hard to blame me for not wanting to talk to her .
I remember that I was frightened and sleepy , but I was afraid that once I fell asleep , I would never wake up again .
the threat of death terrified me .
however , the doctor and the nurse did not understand my fear , nor could I express it to them .
the only thing I could do at that situation was to use every ounce of strength in my body to fight the overwhelming drow@@ s@@ iness .
all of a sudden , I felt a sharp pain .
hyster@@ ically , I asked the doctor : &quot; what have you done ? &quot;
&quot; nothing . &quot; he replied .
later I heard the doctor said to the nurse : &quot; the kid is not cooperating , we need to put her on general anesthesia . &quot;
just like that , I underwent full @-@ body anesthesia .
the last thing I remembered was that I shouted for my mom three times before I was out .
this traumatic experience left a psychological scar in me , as I am still afraid to go to the hospital .
during my adulthood , there were several times that I was running a fever as high as over 40 degree Celsius .
but I would rather stay at home than go to the doctor &apos;s .
when I started to work at the hospital , I saw Ni@@ uni@@ u being forced to get medical treatment last August , and I truly understand his fears .
as a kid , Ni@@ uni@@ u has limited compreh@@ ending capacity and knowledge .
however , parents don &apos;t understand their concerns .
maybe that &apos;s because they don &apos;t know that children have a quite different perception of the world than that of the adults .
the episode of medical care and the physical pain that comes with the treatment might seem more like a death threat to children than a remedy for illness .
parents want their kids to act as they wish .
be it in schools or at the hospital .
however , children also have the right to know .
that &apos;s why we need to inform and help them to accept the situation .
it will be more appropriate to describe the process as finding the best way to help kids deal with the situation rather than as communication .
parents need to learn how to communicate .
how to figure out an effective way to help their kids so that children like Ni@@ uni@@ u can get medical care happily .
nobody is an isolated island , neither are the children .
we need to understand our children , and there is no shortcut for that .
all we need is a little more patience and the willingness to explore different ways of communication .
the last thing I want to tell you is that doctors can save a lot of young lives .
as child life specialists , our duty is to help kids to live a wonderful life they are entitled to .
thank you all !
hello everyone .
I &apos;m Zhang Ling@@ yun , an associate professor from Jing@@ de@@ zhen Cer@@ amic Institute .
I specialize in pottery making .
it has been 20 years since I started learning pottery in university .
time really flies .
back during my university years I just abhor@@ red pottery .
for at that time in Jing@@ de@@ zhen I never found any piece of pottery that could spark my interest .
the streets there were brim@@ ming with monotonous , dull porcelain bottles or porcelain plates .
some looked like productions of the Qing Dynasty , some of the Ming dynasty or the Yuan Dynasty .
but modern porcelain products were never found .
later I went to the US , and was surprised to find that pot@@ ters there made their pot@@ teries in quite a different manner .
their pottery making was un@@ brid@@ led , giving clay completely free play .
only then did I realize that clay actually could create endless possibilities .
and after learning ceramics for several years , I also found that in some sense clay connects to men .
they both are soft , plastic and fragile .
in my class I usually remind my students that &quot; the way you treat the clay will decide how the clay will repay you . &quot;
it &apos;s very much like when two young people are in a relationship .
if one of them negl@@ ects or cold @-@ shoulders the other .
then the latter is sure to give the former a hard time in return .
when I was in the US , one of my American friends one day wore a T @-@ shirt with such words printed on it .
&quot; clay is everything . &quot;
everything in the world is born out of the earth and finally returns to the earth .
I instantly felt I was enlightened .
I began to see clay as the most important thing in the world .
and it was since then that I have developed a special respect and love for the pottery that is made from clay .
there was an exhibition of my ceramic works in Beijing last year , which was titled &quot; C@@ lay is everything . &quot;
I &apos;ll show you some of the exhibited works .
my focus was maj@@ or@@ ly placed on ceramic vessel making in recent years .
these are some of my ceramic works that were displayed in Beijing .
these are blue @-@ and @-@ white porcelain .
we all know that Jing@@ de@@ zhen became famous for its blue @-@ and @-@ white porcelain .
whose history could be traced back hundreds of years to the Yuan Dynasty .
when making my own blue @-@ and @-@ white porcelain cups or other vessels , I prefer to use abstract patterns on them .
this collection is quite interesting .
because all the ceramic works here were fired in a completely different method from what we ordinarily use .
I made them when I was in Japan .
first we dug a large hole on the mountain and filled it with rice hus@@ ks .
then we buried the clay mol@@ ds that had been fired to a temperature as high as 1000 ℃ in the rice hus@@ ks .
after that we covered the hole with Japanese pine and let it burn for eight hours .
the next day , as the ashes cooled down , we lifted out the ceramic vessels .
whose surface would already have been marked by hap@@ haz@@ ardly formed colors and lines .
my first trip to Japan was in 2011 .
when two of my pottery works were included in an ceramics exhibition that was held by 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art , Japan .
during my stay in Japan I was struck by the fact that , unlike in China , the motherland of pottery , in Japan , people were showing overwhelming respect for pottery .
pottery had perme@@ ated into every corner of the Japanese society .
whether it was in the grand@@ est hotel in Tokyo , or in the obscure restaurants of Shi@@ gar@@ aki town near Kyoto , pottery vessels of special aesthetic value and taste were always popular .
anytime we walked into a restaurant .
we would be first served with a large plate holding cups varied in shape and texture , which were for the sake or tea drinking .
I remember getting particularly excited every time , for I could pick the most beautiful one for myself .
Liu Z@@ ong@@ y@@ ue , a famous Japanese folk art theor@@ ist , once said , &quot; Cr@@ ude objects will invoke people &apos;s crude manners with life . &quot;
I take that as the perfect interpretation of the spirit of the vessels .
just think , are vessels not , besides our family members , the things that we spend most of our time with ?
they are used at dinners from morning to night , and even find their way to the intervals such as the tea time .
and vessels also bear upon our temperament .
let &apos;s take a look at this picture .
I bet at home you , or your parents , are using such kinds of plates and bowls ?
those who &apos;ll say yes please raise your hand .
and I guess more people than we think are still using them .
last year , I visited a very famous modern artist in China , whom I have been wor@@ shi@@ ping since I was a little girl .
I was shocked when I saw that he , too , was using such vessels , &quot; Se@@ eing such vessels in your house made my heart sink , &quot; I told him .
you should know that he is really a great artist .
and he replied , &quot; Well , I know they are ugly , but I just can &apos;t find anything really beautiful in China . &quot;
as for myself .
well , I will make vessels by myself , or use those crafted by my Japanese friends or those I &apos;ve bought from across the world .
with those beautiful vessels around me , I develop a special passion for cooking and dish washing .
each day seems to be a great blessing for me .
the sight of the vessels is just so pleasing .
now suppose , if every day we could eat dinners with such beautiful vessels , wouldn &apos;t it be possible that we &apos;ll invariably feel happy ?
and why do I love washing dishes in particular ?
because when the water is pouring down on the bowls .
they &apos;ll present a different yet ver@@ itable beauty not seen at their usual time .
the beauty of vessels .
as I see it , should not be only defined as an external beauty .
beauty in the literal sense is actually very vain .
the beauty of vessels should mean that a life is struggling its way to a perfect end .
just think about it .
from making a clay mold , to drying , gla@@ zing and firing it .
the process of making a pottery work could be as arduous as life itself .
I &apos;ve made many trips abroad in recent years and met a lot of excellent pot@@ ters .
and here I &apos;ll be very glad to introduce some of them to you .
this is Mit@@ su@@ o Sh@@ o@@ ji , who is now a professor and doctoral supervisor in the University of Sydney .
he went to Australia from Japan at a very young age and became the first student of Kaz@@ uo Y@@ ag@@ i , the pioneer of modern Japanese ceramics .
and I respect him a lot .
one famous Japanese restaurant in Sydney is using vessels all made by Mit@@ su@@ o Sh@@ o@@ ji .
once I was having supper with Mr .
Mit@@ su@@ o Sh@@ o@@ ji at his home .
the exqu@@ is@@ it@@ eness of his arrangement of food and vessels amazed me .
leaving his house that night I thanked him for such a lovely dinner .
and his response was , &quot; That &apos;s nothing . we dine like that every day.@@ Next time you come to Sydney , do live in my house , and you can have such dinners every day . &quot;
only then did I realize that such exqu@@ is@@ it@@ eness had become part of his life .
vessels can reflect the daily life of a person or a family .
and more than that , they also bes@@ peak the character of their poss@@ essors ,
just as Hei@@ de@@ gger once said , &quot; The thing one holds partly represents his personality . &quot;
there are some other young Japanese pot@@ ters that I want to introduce here .
this is O@@ sam@@ u Ko@@ j@@ ima , who is plain @-@ looking , or rather , too plain @-@ looking .
but he is really a very talented pot@@ ter .
he has won a lot of international ceramic prizes in recent years .
but he is very poor and has to work in a bak@@ ery for a living , for few people can understand his art .
he is a very strange person , never catering to popular taste .
I remember once when I was visiting him in his house .
I saw his three @-@ year @-@ old son eating a cake out of a wood @-@ fired , cr@@ ud@@ ely @-@ beautiful plate .
I couldn &apos;t help thinking how terrific it was that aesthetic education could be so un@@ noticeable and beauty could be so effor@@ tlessly felt by children at such a young age .
this is T@@ et@@ su@@ ya I@@ shi@@ y@@ ama , a friend of mine whom I &apos;ve known for years .
he is now a young , prominent figure in Japanese ceramics .
and he is also the protagon@@ ist of a very peculi@@ arly interesting story .
I wrote a story about him last year which was published by The Great Out@@ doors .
T@@ et@@ su@@ ya I@@ shi@@ y@@ ama &apos;s parents are both extreme Christians .
since childhood T@@ et@@ su@@ ya I@@ shi@@ y@@ ama had been told by them that one day the Earth would be destroyed , and so would all the human beings .
God would then come to bring them all to heaven . diligence and study were thus not so necessary .
so T@@ et@@ su@@ ya I@@ shi@@ y@@ ama id@@ led all the way through primary school and high school .
the thought of learning never occurred to him .
he lived every day believing that the Earth would vanish one day and God would pick them up and take them to heaven .
later , as could be predicted , he failed to be admitted by any university .
then he became a tree prun@@ er .
actually even then he had already developed an intense interest in ceramics .
he even spent a large amount of money in buying ceramic vessels .
then one day he said to himself , &quot; Maybe I could make my own ceramics . &quot;
thus he began his experiment , which , over the course of ten years afterwards , gradually unfolded as the start of a journey that finally transformed him into an outstanding pot@@ ter in Japan .
he must have encountered a lot of hardships during these ten years .
but he never mentions a word about them .
his biggest regret is that he , blin@@ ded by his parents &apos; words , gave up reading and never had a chance to go to the university .
so now sometimes when he is visiting his parents .
he will behave as if challenging them , asking &quot; So when exactly is the Earth going to be destroyed ? &quot;
and his parents will always answer , &quot; So@@ on . it won &apos;t be very long . &quot;
( chuck@@ le )
this man is Ki@@ y@@ ot@@ su@@ gu S@@ awa , a representative of Japan &apos;s wood @-@ fired school of ceramics .
he is possibly over 70 years old by now .
I remember when I first met him in Japan .
he was always working on some large ceramic work , which sometimes could reach 3 meters in height .
but one night I found him making a small cup in his ceramics studio .
first , he shaped the clay .
then he molded it with his hand , giving it little t@@ weak@@ s .
I was sitting across from him then , watching him adjusting the mold with great patience all the time .
and I was deeply moved .
I told him that I had never imagined he would make small objects such as cups .
he replied with a smile , &quot; Cu@@ ps are very important . we have to use them every day . &quot;
I guess his dedication to the making of a ceramic cup was because of the awe he felt for the earth .
and it is the same awe that enables Japanese people to out@@ strip their Chinese peers in ceramics .
daily utensils always denote what height the civilization in a certain era has reached .
Chinese ceramic vessels , after being elegant in the Song Dynasty , humble in the Yuan Dynasty , diversified in the Ming Dynasty and exquisite in the Qing Dynasty , however .
end up being treated with indifference today .
that is terribly discour@@ aging and up@@ setting .
but I still think it is the best of times in history for Chinese ceramics .
blank spaces in aesthetics and creation will actually render the potential of the future unpredictable .
and the unknown space is always far broader than the known sphere .
thank you !
what is the topic I want to share with you today ?
it is nature .
maybe you have seen this picture .
I know that many of you have heard about this project .
they are &quot; Nu@@ ts Brother , &quot; both online celebrities and qualified as artists to some extent . they did a performance art in 2015 .
they used a vacuum cleaner to suck up dirt and dust in the air on the Chang &apos;an Avenue .
and they also did the same thing in other public places .
as we all know .
the vacuum cleaner is used to clean the floor .
but &quot; Nu@@ ts Brother &quot; used it to pick up dirt and dust in the air .
what did they get after 100 days ?
he used the dust to make a brick .
then he put it in an old house in Beijing .
smog has become a major threat to our life in the big cities .
some people suggest escaping to the countryside .
besides air pollution , there are other challenges including traffic congestion and high housing prices .
we often criticize that our buildings are against nature .
the more houses we build , the more damage we will bring to nature .
today I would like to share how to merge with nature when building .
I would like to share with you some art@@ works .
through art appreciation , we will further explore human &apos;s perception of nature and the relationship between nature and construction .
this is W@@ eng F@@ en .
an artist who has took a series of photographs -- S@@ itting on the Wall .
let &apos;s look at this series of art@@ works .
when I interpret this artwork as an architect and a cur@@ ator , I believe , in some sense , it reflects the human survival has reached a critical point . I &apos;m not sure whether the artist agrees with me
the title of the artwork is S@@ itting on the Wall .
which reflects that we are forced into a difficult situation and become trapped .
looking backward , we see nature with a sense of nostalgia .
looking forward , we see houses built by us , an artificial city .
in such a situation , which one is our real destination ?
which future do we prefer ?
the future contains nostalgia and pri@@ stine clarity in the countryside or the future with more buildings created by human ?
I think we should think these questions really seriously .
we have newly established an architecture prize in China - China Architecture Media Award .
a well @-@ known architect , Wang Shu , who is also the first Lau@@ reate of the P@@ rit@@ z@@ ker Architecture Prize , serves as the chairman of the judge committee . this P@@ rit@@ z@@ ker prize is often referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture .
when we made the principle for lau@@ reate selection , Wang Shu proposed an idea of &quot; natural architecture . &quot;
therefore , we set the theme of the award as &quot; natural architecture . &quot;
what does &quot; natural architecture &quot; mean ?
does it mean that we could only use natural materials to build houses ?
in other words , are we not allowed to use artificial materials ?
what &apos;s the definition of &quot; natural architecture &quot; ?
I think nature can be perceived from two perspectives .
one is &quot; nature &quot; in the form of noun and the other is natural or naturally , its adjective or adver@@ b form .
which means we build houses in a natural , reasonable and logical way .
some people express disapproval of concrete or steel buildings and call them rubbish .
they think such building materials bring more damage to nature .
but is it an imagination about the nature ?
Europe is re@@ embracing natur@@ alism as a new trend .
when urban diseases become endemic .
many young Chinese architects tend to draw architectural illustrations or architectural ren@@ der@@ ings in the style of R@@ ous@@ se@@ au .
R@@ ous@@ se@@ au is a French painter .
what is his style of painting ?
he often depicts Ar@@ cad@@ ian jungle scenes .
countryside and rural life that are both peaceful and very dangerous .
when you look closely at the painting .
you will find that , the seemingly calm jungle also is the territory of animals such as lions and cattle .
they have to compete for survival in a cruel way .
is it a kind of nature that we are scared of ?
or is it the one that we y@@ earn for ?
I notice that all of us love nature .
we like to bring nature to home and add a little green to our home for nature &apos;s sake .
however , in 2008 , an artist created an artwork for a joint project of St@@ a@@ at@@ lic@@ he Kun@@ st@@ sam@@ m@@ lun@@ gen D@@ res@@ den and National Art Museum of China .
in which all of us participated .
this artist , Shen Sha@@ om@@ in made a Bon@@ sai installation .
I believe many of you have learned an article titled Pavilion for S@@ ick Pl@@ um Tre@@ es in middle school .
it said that traditional Chinese intell@@ ects enjoyed twisted and unusual natural landscape .
they thought a bon@@ sai landscape of a healthy tree was boring .
when people were making bon@@ sai .
they would like it more twisted .
this is our imagination about beauty .
but it sounds a little bit per@@ vert and twisted .
in my opinion , hor@@ ticul@@ ture derived from such techniques .
especially the Chinese traditional bon@@ sai techniques .
is very violent and cruel .
if we look at the installation closely .
we will find this kind of hor@@ ticul@@ ture is based on pushing down , hanging and ham@@ mering .
there is no difference between such techniques and torture .
as a result , such plants show a twisted beauty that fits our imagination .
what does it mean to us ?
Gong Z@@ iz@@ hen wants to express that we should not foster talents in this way .
this is also true as for nature .
when we recre@@ ate nature in a virtual way .
simulate nature or reflect nature in our architecture .
do we also twist it in a per@@ vert way ?
maybe you never know various cruel and violent hor@@ ticul@@ ture techniques before .
for example , some people think a tree with scars is beautiful .
if a tree has a smooth bark , people would regard it ugly and want to make a scar on it .
how to do it ?
cutting is the best solution .
after cutting the bark , they smear honey on the wound before putting ants on the honey .
ants keep biting the tree bark and the scar becomes larger and larger .
it is very violent .
most of you may realize that .
actually , we have re@@ invented nature out of imagination and even bring it to our daily life .
I often talk to myself .
I tell myself that if nests of ants or honey@@ comb@@ s of bees are regarded as part of nature , the city of human beings .
when we look from a higher position , or from the space , is also merely a piece of thin texture .
therefore , the steel and concrete jungle has also become a part of nature when you look from a different angle .
the artwork of the Chinese artist Yang Yong@@ li@@ ang gives us an angle .
he has created a Chinese landscape painting , with sc@@ ener@@ ies of mountains and rivers .
but what do the mountains and rivers consist of ?
let &apos;s take a closer look .
they are mountains of high @-@ end buildings and mach@@ in@@ eries that produce them .
such as scaff@@ ol@@ dings , construction cranes .
I think this painting is a symbol of contemporary China .
we y@@ earn for Ar@@ cad@@ ian countryside life the same as Chinese intell@@ ects .
but our dream turns sour again .
what are the so @-@ called mountains and rivers look like in our daily life ?
taking Shanghai as an example .
Shanghai &apos; s mountains and rivers are high @-@ end buildings and scaff@@ ol@@ dings .
but if we change our perspective and regard our surroundings as a poetic shaped space associated with splendor and harmony .
we may realize that we are in the middle of nature created by ourselves .
it is the same nature as the honey@@ comb@@ s of bees and nests of ants .
what are the most unnatural materials for architecture ?
it is concrete .
actually , it is first created by the modernization of cities in the 20th century .
it is a kind of most commonly used industrial material .
European photographers , for example .
the Ber@@ nd and H@@ illa Bec@@ her of the D@@ ü@@ s@@ sel@@ dor@@ f school created a famous artwork based on the original form of industrial buildings .
they helped people find the beauty of the industrial buildings .
many contemporary architects think concrete is not natural .
it is too artificial .
but If you ask them to choose the most comfortable material for the design of their own houses .
they will say , &quot; concrete is a comfortable and natural material . &quot;
in other words .
the beauty of industrial buildings and works of Moder@@ n@@ ism masters such as Le Cor@@ busi@@ er and M@@ ies have changed our views on nature and building materials .
if appropriately used , concrete is a very comfortable material or even a trendy material of today .
most interior design of minim@@ alism architecture use concrete as the building material .
this is a praise for the beauty of industrial civilization .
is it part of our thinking about nature ?
nowadays , artists , architects and av@@ ant @-@ grade people enjoy living in the old factories , even without further decoration .
such as covering the wall with cloth or soft materials like before .
it is because they want to retain the rough texture of the concrete in the building .
such beauty is what we pursue .
have we changed our attitude towards concrete , industry and nature ?
many architects and artists have tried to use the elements of nature in their works .
some even propose to fully abandon artificial materials and use natural materials .
for example , a very important 20th century conceptual artist , Y@@ ves Kle@@ in , patented a color of his own invention .
which is called International Kle@@ in Blue .
he came up with an idea of using air , fire and light to build gardens or houses .
this is his draft and conception about the use of air and light .
he also published a book titled Air Architecture .
this idea was realized by an American architect who built a water @-@ moisture building for an exposition .
this architecture only existed in the Expo .
after the Expo , water valves were closed , and the moisture building disappeared .
during the Expo 2005 in A@@ ichi Prefecture of Japan .
to minimize environmental impact on the site .
great care was taken to build the pav@@ ili@@ ons out of recycled or recy@@ cl@@ able materials .
and all pav@@ ili@@ ons were can@@ ti@@ lev@@ ered over the natural environment .
after the Expo was closed , all the building materials were removed , and the environment stayed intact .
with this method , we stay true to nature .
we only use natural materials .
are there other architectural methods that inv@@ ov@@ le natural materials ?
yes , there are .
as we all know , the Swiss architecture firm Her@@ zo@@ g &amp; de Me@@ ur@@ on is the designer of Beijing National Stadium ( Bird &apos;s N@@ est ) for use throughout the 2008 Olympics .
it uses another way to reflect nature in the architecture with concrete , glass and steels .
how could he achieve this goal ?
he adopts an artistic method to achieve this idea .
it uses lith@@ ographic technique to print patterns on concrete , stones , and glasses .
of course , the technology is not that simple .
materials have to be pre@@ fabricated before the representation of nature .
Ric@@ ola Ltd is a Swiss manufacturer of colorful can@@ dies .
maybe you have eaten these kind of can@@ dies .
they are very famous .
Her@@ zo@@ g &amp; de Me@@ ur@@ on was commissioned to build a warehouse for Ric@@ ola .
it invited a famous German photographer Thomas Ru@@ ff to take the photo of a leaf , which was used to make can@@ dies .
Thomas Ru@@ ff used coarse @-@ gr@@ ained techniques to make the leaf photo look like a stone scrip@@ ture .
then Her@@ zo@@ g &amp; de Me@@ ur@@ on printed the leaf pattern on the material made up of concrete , steel and glass .
in this way the roof was embell@@ ished with leaf patterns .
in fact , through such an artistic way .
we reflect nature in the architecture without using the pure natural materials .
nature is still with the building even if we use artificial materials .
this is an advanced simulation or reflection of nature , in which the use of pure natural material seems not necessary .
in fact , similar things also happen in China .
Hsi@@ eh Ying @-@ Chun is an architect from Taiwan .
he has made great contribution to the post @-@ disaster construction .
every summer , he will lead architecture students from all over the nation to remote villages and build houses voluntarily for local people .
so here comes a question .
shall we choose to use natural materials or more reasonable , appropriate , available and cheaper materials to integrate with nature ?
some people criticized him of using light steel structure in the countryside .
the light steel structure he used has a very small weight .
you may think it is expensive and luxury to use light steel as building materials .
but the fact is , due to over@@ production , China &apos;s steel inventory has far exceeded its demands .
Hsi@@ eh Ying @-@ Chun told me that the price of steels was almost equal to the price of water with the same weight .
besides , the light steel has another advantage -- fast delivery .
logistics companies such as J@@ D@@ .com are able to send the steel to the construction site within very short time .
even if the site is located in a remote village .
in this way , we will quickly finish the construction of steel structure within two or three days .
after one or two days , the cement will be filled into the wall .
this kind of construction can be finished very quickly with a very low cost .
although such kind of construction uses steel , which seems not natural .
it is a very reasonable , logical and natural way to build archit@@ ectures in the countryside .
the word nature is not a noun here , because we do not use the pure natural material .
for me , nature is an adver@@ b or adjective .
it means using a very natural , reasonable and available method .
which may be a kind of human wisdom .
although we cannot stop building things or stop relating to nature .
we could use smarter ways to improve the construction methods .
instead of using pure natural materials , we could use concrete , new industrial materials , and steel in architecture .
as long as architects , planners and landscape architects fully express their wisdom and figure out reasonable solutions that suit local conditions , its culture and environment could be well preserved .
I believe this is a right attitude .
this is what I want to share with you today .
let &apos;s think about how to really face nature .
shall we isolate nature , or work together to create , re@@ shape and build better nature ?
thank you very much !
hi , everyone .
today I &apos;m here to talk about &quot; eternal collection . &quot;
in order to make that happen , we have to use digital technologies .
you probably heard the news at June that the number of visitors to Dun@@ huang Mog@@ ao C@@ aves rose so much that the original daily limit of 6,000 reserved tickets had increased to 12,000 .
however , this expansion was still not enough to cater to the growing number of tourists .
another 6,000 emergency tickets were added that day . that added to 18@@ ,000 tourists for a single day .
in fact , this was still far from enough .
a larger daily reservation volume can be expected .
such record tourist numbers have brought tremendous pressure on the protection of the Mog@@ ao C@@ aves and other similar cultural herit@@ ages .
the protection of cultural relics has been carrying on for decades .
besides tourist issue , the Mog@@ ao C@@ aves differs from museum collections in many ways .
the caves have been constantly exposed to air and light .
besides , soil erosion , desertification , storms and other environmental issues in the upper reaches have had a serious impact on them .
as early as 2003 , Fan Jin@@ shi , the previous dean , proposed the idea of &quot; digital Dun@@ huang . &quot;
&quot; digital Dun@@ huang &quot; includes mainly three aspects .
the first aspect is to digit@@ alize morals through still photography to protect them .
the second is to use three @-@ dimensional modeling to protect the spectacular sculptures in Mog@@ ao C@@ aves .
this involves a process of 3D modeling .
the third one is to measure the dimension of the caves , their relative positions and so on .
then data should be recorded .
as I mentioned earlier , the Mog@@ ao C@@ aves are exposed to nature .
no matter how well they are protected , they will perish one day .
in each given period of time , they are constantly changing .
therefore , if we can archive such data , the future generations will still get a glimpse of the Mog@@ ao C@@ aves nowadays .
we had the privilege to have participated in such a three @-@ dimensional digi@@ tization project of the Mog@@ ao C@@ aves .
the underlying engineering technology of three @-@ dimensional reconstruction is reverse modeling .
what is reverse modeling ?
if we build a digital prototype to represent something that does not exist yet , this is called forward modeling .
for example , development of ren@@ der@@ ings of architectural design , industrial design , fashion design , and interior decoration are all forward modeling .
if we build a three @-@ dimension model to represent something in reality , this is called reverse modeling .
in 2006 , our team created a new technology .
to put it simply , this technology enables us to analyze the spatial position of two images taken at two spatial points .
thus , we can infer a certain pixel in the z @-@ direction and reproduce the pixel as three @-@ dimensional point clouds .
after converting a point cloud to a 3D surface , we can extract a physical model of the object .
from 2006 to 2010 .
we finished the R &amp; D of related equipment and technology such as the development of the software , the hardware , and the process control , and manufactured the engineering protot@@ ypes .
I still remember the feeling of surprise and excitement we experienced the night when the two @-@ dimensional pixel points of a facial image were turned into three dimensional point clouds and they began to rotate in the computer .
it was also at this moment that I was transformed from a still photographer of many years into a practitioner of three @-@ dimensional modeling .
our technology has the following characteristics .
our technology rest@@ ores static two @-@ dimensional pixel points into three @-@ dimensional point clouds .
so it has some inherent advantages .
the first advantage is its high @-@ quality 3D resolution , pixel @-@ level resolution .
the second advantage , its high @-@ quality color reproduction and color position accuracy , is also related to pixels .
behind me is a picture .
the color image on its left side is a part of one m@@ ural .
it displayed the original condition of the m@@ ural .
by color reproduction .
we mean we have a standardized color management system .
one feature of three @-@ dimensional models is that they can be over@@ shadowed by the colors of the image .
therefore , we removed all the colors and left only the un@@ colored models , or prime models known in our line of work .
the three @-@ dimensional prime model represents clearly the painter &apos;s strokes of the painting from Tang Dynasty .
this is our 3D resolution and our color performance .
these characteristics give our technology unique advantages in three @-@ dimensional reconstruction of cultural relics .
because color and resolution are two key indicators for technology application in cultural heritage protection or future film industries .
our ties with Dun@@ huang started in 2011 .
one day , I had a call from a friend in Dun@@ huang Mog@@ ao G@@ rot@@ to .
he said , &quot; Hu , I heard that you have made great technological progress .
do you happen to have any interest in the 3D reconstruction of the colorful sculptures in Mog@@ ao C@@ aves ? &quot;
I quickly agreed without any further hesitation .
in retrospect , it was such a daring decision .
at the time , I had never been to there before .
my previous acquaintance with Mog@@ ao C@@ aves were limited to several pictures of them .
back then , Mog@@ ao C@@ aves seemed so beautiful , mysterious , fascinating , and full of legends to me .
so I was very interested in them .
after passing several rounds of technological tests by Dun@@ huang Research Academy .
we were finally allowed to enter the caves for experimental shooting and modeling .
our first experience entering the caves left us several impressions .
one of them was the emerging feeling of fear as we got more informed .
we entered the caves with the equipment .
the caves were very narrow inside .
however , the height of some Buddha statues can reach 5 meters in C@@ ave No.@@ 3@@ 32 .
there were three groups of such five @-@ meter @-@ high statues .
but the shooting space was only less than a dozen square meters .
in addition , there was a central column in the caves .
behind the column was a Buddha niche twice as wide as the pro@@ scen@@ ium .
inside the Buddha niche lay an eight @-@ meter @-@ long re@@ clin@@ ing Buddha .
in such limited space , the free space to the goal was only 1.2 meters .
just imagine how difficult it would be to shoot such a target if we use a mobile phone .
I was so discouraged at the time .
because there were lots of other professional equipment .
such as the professional equipment to light the set .
the requirements on lighting were much stricter than still photography .
in still photography , it is up to the photographer to decide how to light the set .
the photographer can light the target in ways as he likes .
however , in our case , we have to follow certain standards .
the lighting has to be well @-@ planned on set .
therefore , how to light the set was a challenge for us .
the space was so tight .
what should we do ?
after discussion , we decided to collect the data for model verification first .
we shot the part below the waist of the Sak@@ y@@ am@@ un@@ i Buddha statue and reconstructed the images .
it took us ten days of work to complete the reconstruction of such a small part .
the heads of the major departments and experts from the academy acknowledged these data .
these data were far from complete as not all parts had been photographed .
but they were qualified in themselves .
as a result , we were approved to go on with further experiments .
here I would like to thank all the heads of departments , technical staff , and experts from Dun@@ huang Research Academy involved for trusting us , an unofficial team , to enter the cave and shoot .
it was not an easy decision to make .
they took great responsibilities and high risks in making this decision .
we must live up to their expectations .
during our stay , there was a flood there . here is a picture of the flood . at first sight , you might think it is a picture of the south of the lower reaches of Chang@@ jiang . there is a river called D@@ aqu@@ an River in front of Mog@@ ao C@@ aves . some of you may have been to Mog@@ ao C@@ aves .
I saw the flood in 2011 .
it suddenly poured down from the top of the San@@ wei Mountain .
imagine the flood breached the embankment of the D@@ aqu@@ an River .
a body of one @-@ meter @-@ high flood ran across the tens of kilometers of the deserts .
just imagine what the scene would look like .
the visual impact of the scene on me was extremely strong .
through this experience .
we came to see the significance and urgency of our work .
we were motivated not only by the wish to verify our technology but also by the feelings of reverence , admiration and amazement at the gran@@ deur of the Mog@@ ao C@@ aves .
these cultural relics gave us a sense of belonging and pride towards the ingenuity of human beings .
so , we were determined to complete the tasks .
after we first returned from there .
we made some equipment improvements to enable the device reach every angle .
as I have mentioned , images for three @-@ dimensional modeling have different requirements from still photography .
the images had to be taken by the cameras from multiple angles .
here are some pictures of the job site when we went there for the second and third time .
I would also like to add one more point .
when the mur@@ als in C@@ ave No.@@ 3@@ 32 were lit up .
I saw more than just the profound depths of the mineral pig@@ ments , the clarity of varying colors , and the stere@@ oscopic effect .
what did I see in it ?
in them , I saw the Western styles of impres@@ sion@@ ism and even Fau@@ vism .
however , they were created more than a thousand years ago .
we are familiar to such names as Mon@@ et , Van Go@@ gh , or even M@@ atis@@ se
however , do we know the pain@@ ters who created these paintings more than a thousand years ago ?
do we know these ancestors ?
who were they ?
what were their backgrounds ?
it was very thought @-@ provoking .
our next step was data verification .
there are many methods for data verification .
paper copy is the most direct method .
so we used three @-@ dimensional printing .
due to equipment limitations , the dimensions of our print copy are still restricted .
the picture on the left is a photo of the scene .
it was 4.8 meters high , nearly five meters high .
the picture on the right is one of our photocop@@ ies .
the copy is 60 cm wide , printed at a 1 : 6 scale .
such a 60 @-@ cm @-@ wide copy has to be printed in six pieces .
the photocopy contains all the details that can be reflected on a 60 cm scale .
I would also like to add that one day if the dimensions of the photocopy become larger and the color reproduction becomes more accurate .
our data is also suitable for printing at a 1 : 1 scale or a larger scale .
note that our technology can achieve pixel @-@ level restoration .
after the first round of work , at the end of 2011 , the reconstruction of C@@ ave No.@@ 3@@ 32 was completed .
the data of C@@ ave No.@@ 3@@ 32 was the first three @-@ dimensional reconstruction data of im@@ movable large @-@ scale sculptures in China .
after finishing our first @-@ round tasks .
we concluded what we have learned from these experiences because there was more work to be done .
during the first @-@ round work , our equipment could barely do the job .
so we made improvements in four aspects when we came back .
the first were the supporting devices of the cameras .
we adopted a modular design .
this modular design enabled us to cater to the different positions and dimensions of the on @-@ site artifacts .
second , we make some improvements to our software , mainly software for image processing .
our team originally had some 10 members .
it originally needed about 15 people to complete the work of C@@ ave No.@@ 3@@ 32 .
but with the software , it needs only four people to finish the tasks .
the third improvement we made was to the models .
in this way , our entire process was now complete .
these improvements pushed the color quality of the images and the integrity of the data to a new height .
here is a picture of a copy taken with the new equipment .
a full reconstruction of C@@ ave No.@@ 45 .
cave No.@@ 45 dated back to Tang Dynasty .
characters in the mur@@ als all look very confident .
we can see the image of Bo@@ d@@ his@@ att@@ v@@ as , an iconic image in the Mog@@ ao C@@ aves .
this m@@ ural also dated back to Tang Dynasty .
his posture is very graceful and his attitude is very confident .
we can see from the picture how confident he looks !
this is a work from Tang Dynasty .
in 20@@ 16 , we had another idea .
which is also a requirement from the Dun@@ huang Research Academy for our team .
our original intention was to save the data .
however , is there any possibility to put these data into use ?
the answer was clear .
we have a large range of technical means available .
for example , we have made att@@ em@@ ps in possible application concerning two areas .
the first is a hard copy .
printing is such a means .
however , as I mentioned before , due to the restrictions on the dimensions of the copies and their color reproduction .
printing is not a good direction yet .
we built a new process , which is consisted of taking the pictures , modeling and 3D printing .
we put the pieces from the three @-@ dimension printers together .
before molding and casting , we er@@ ased all the seams .
after the mold is built , artists will color the model manually .
our artist also used mineral raw materials .
which create rich layers of the mineral pig@@ ments , and a color performance comparable to the original m@@ ural .
the different shades of color injected new life and vibr@@ ancy into the replica .
the second direction is their visual application .
we have made several attempts .
one of them is the hol@@ ographic images
one day when V@@ R or AR technology truly takes off .
our data will prove to be valuable materials .
in my view , AR and V@@ R technologies still have a long way to go .
it would be awesome to see our data used in V@@ R one day .
our data is quite detailed .
this is a picture of the reconstruction of C@@ ave No.@@ 57 .
starting from C@@ ave No.@@ 57 .
we have carried out a comprehensive reconstruction of the caves , the mur@@ als inside included .
as I see it , these repl@@ ic@@ as and exquisite art crafts offer a means to know ourselves and get us known .
here is a thought of mine .
we have so many great collections .
so maybe one day we can see portraits other than David &apos;s hanging outside of art students &apos; classrooms .
maybe we can see portraits other than Beethoven &apos;s outside the piano room .
maybe we can see portraits other than Venus &apos;s in entertainment venues such as bath@@ houses .
this is one of my humble yet interesting thinking .
to conclude , technology and art , past and present , will still be in conflicts with each other within a certain time span .
however , I think one day .
they will definitely merge at a certain level .
as William Bl@@ ake said in his poem , &quot; to see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower , hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour , &quot; 3D reconstruction technology will give eternal life to these collections .
thank you !
hi , everyone .
I am Gao Feng .
big data is considered as the new oil of the digital economy .
such a statement compares data to valuable resources .
in fact , we have come to see that the &quot; data as resources &quot; theory cannot fully reflect the value of data themselves .
it is more appropriate to consider data as assets .
data are similar to lands and have their own values .
however , more value do@@ est not come from the land itself .
but from what kind of houses and roads are built on it .
this kind of added value would exhibit in fact geometric growth .
Tim Ber@@ ners @-@ Lee , father of the World Wide Web , has established the Open Data Institute in the UK .
this research institute has proposed a new idea in the past two years , claiming that data is a vital infrastructure .
we emphasize the social value of data as well as its inherent value .
the character of infrastructure of data actually lays the foundation for a city &apos;s innovation , which relies on data to support the whole innovation system .
during this process , we could observe the overall change of innovation paradig@@ ms across the world .
in the past , innovation was work behind closed doors .
universities , laboratories , and companies carried out their research respectively and in isolation .
now shared bikes are a familiar sight on the streets and D@@ idi has become our first choice for ride @-@ ha@@ iling services .
this type of business model adopts actually a asset @-@ light strategy .
it builds an open platform that allows us to integrate res@@ sources and create value .
under this innovation paradigm .
we can consider our city as a decentralized platform .
one that is readable and writ@@ able so that people could participate in its construction .
in turn , such method of creation and innovation requires the support of an infrastructure , data .
in this process , the free flow of data is a key point .
here is a picture of the data spectrum by UK &apos;s Open Data Research Institute .
closed data is at the far left of the spectrum .
data of national security or personal privacy information should be closed .
opened data is at the far right of the spectrum , those are the data that are completely open .
this type of data should be made fully available for everyone to use and re@@ publish .
in between the two kinds are shared data of various degrees .
the use of these data may be restricted in various degrees according to the purposes of use and target users .
but overall , they should be made open .
when we talk about open data .
what kind of data are we referring to ?
let us take a simple example .
before dining out , many of us will check the reviews and recommendations on D@@ az@@ hong Di@@ an@@ pin first .
these user reviews and recommendations are public data .
because they are made public on the Internet and accessible for each of us .
however , are they open data ?
no .
why ?
first , they are offered in a re@@ usable format .
if we download an excel spread@@ sheet .
we would usually open it in Exc@@ el for analysis .
such a re@@ usable format is a key distinction between open data and public data .
a more critical distinction is whether there is an open authorization or license .
whether the data &apos;s provider gives us an explicit authorization to freely use these data and create value with them .
such an authorization is the biggest distinction between public data and open data .
the threshold for open data sounds high .
so why should we do it ?
opening the data offers us a solution to access data .
the opening of data in fact encourages people to use data and create more values .
for instance , the UK opened their data in 2009 .
it had long been the hope of the municipality of London that the Department for Transport would open up their data of the bus arrival time and that of the subway .
in 2011 , the Department for Transport finally began to do such experiments and they were amazed .
within a year after the data were opened .
more than 5,000 app developers were attracted and developed various applications for the department .
at that time , smart@@ phones were not as popular as today yet .
so 500 new traffic applications on the AP@@ P store was a huge achievement .
these applications have served more than 40 million London citizens and tourists .
indirectly generating nearly 50 million pounds of social and economic value .
this is an example of the positive impacts that open data can bring .
the free flow of data brings a fai@@ rer opportunity and possibility for innovation .
as for the development of open data in the world , along with the UK , the US is also one of the few countries that first proposed open data .
in fact , the Obama administration was the first to initiate government @-@ led open data .
the United Kingdom and the United States have been lead this trend of open data .
countries such as Singapore , Italy , and Canada are following closely behind .
in 2011 , our city , Shanghai , started the debate on whether our government should pursue such a open data initiative .
in 2012 , Shanghai launched Data Shanghai , the first data exchange center in the country .
in 20@@ 14 , Shanghai took the lead in making another attempt and organized the Shanghai Big Data Development Innovation Con@@ test in the hope to call on the public to contribute their ideas with the data opened by the government .
and to find out what kinds of data the public needs .
to date , over 20 to 30 different cities and provinces across the country have launched such open data initiatives .
there are several common pain points in this process .
the first one is the lack of motivation .
open data may be one of the priorities of regional economic and information technology committee or development and reform commission .
however , functional departments such as Public Security Bureau or Transportation Bureau may lack the motivation to open the data .
if we look at the data that has been opened , we can find out if there are apps that are developed based on this data .
in fact , very few applications have been developed based on these open data .
so is this because of the mis@@ match between the open data and the actual needs ?
with such a question in mind .
in 2015 we developed an interesting app called SO@@ DA , which stands for Shanghai Open Data Ap@@ ps .
we found this acr@@ onym very interesting .
soda sounds the same as soda .
here is a very interesting comparison .
if we think of data as a can of soda , there is no f@@ iz@@ z when the bottle is still .
when we crack open a can of soda .
it will f@@ iz@@ z , just like when data is shared , more values would be created .
this was why we chose such a name for the app .
in 2015 , we started to hold a contest .
in the first year , we experim@@ ented with data from the field of urban transportation .
we collaborated with Shanghai Public Transportation Card Service Center , Shanghai Qi@@ ang@@ sheng Holding Co . , Ltd. and some bus companies who provided part of their data from the earlier periods for the competition .
in this way , we were able to predict the potential value to be created by open data , and collect feedback at a low cost .
this experiment confirmed that the free flow of data does create commercial values .
here is another interesting case .
there is an app called OK car insurance .
their business model was very simple .
traditionally , insurance premium was fixed .
all the customers pay@@ ed the same amount of insurance fees .
it occurred to them to help insurance companies to develop a dynamic way of pricing .
they worked on car insurance that targeted drivers .
is there a way to evaluate each driver &apos;s driving risks ?
it is sensible that high @-@ risk drivers should pay more .
however , how do we evaluate ?
they developed an app and download on the driver &apos;s mobile phone .
the sensors on the phone will collect the driver &apos;s daily driving behavior .
however , how to decide which driving behaviors are of high risk and those of low risk ?
soda has played a key role in it .
as we just mentioned , we collected some data from Shanghai Qi@@ ang@@ sheng Holding Co . , Ltd .
based on the data from the Shanghai Qi@@ ang@@ sheng Holding Co . , Ltd ..
they calculated the drivers &apos; average driving speed on every street in Shanghai .
they used the data as a baseline and compared it with those collected from the drivers &apos; phones .
in this way , they were able to generate a rough driving risk index .
although it was a simple business model .
they attracted investment of 10 million dollars from ID@@ G and J@@ D .
this is a case where the flow of data created economic values .
in fact , the free flow of data brings not only economic values but also innovation in governmental governance .
some of you may have heard the news that two years ago .
Shanghai introduced the most stringent Food Safety Regulations in the country .
this new regulation put more pressure on the food safety department to do a better job in food safety supervision .
however , we have limited numbers of civil servants .
the manpower was extremely insufficient .
so is there a way to predict which restaurants are more likely to have food safety problems with the help of data ?
last year , one team made a very smart attempt .
they integrated data of inspection , data of penalties issued by the food and drug administration , and reviews from online platforms .
after carrying out textual analysis on these .
they produced a risk index of food safety .
this risk index can help regul@@ at@@ ation office to target and regulate the higher @-@ risk enterprises effectively .
soda is more of an experiment platform rather than a contest .
it provides a way for the data providers like government agencies and companies to stream their data into an experimental platform .
through a contest like this , a large number of innov@@ ators in data use were found in a single go .
data providers can choose from this pool of talents and find out the best candidates to solve their problems .
on the other hand , this contest offered a way to attract capital to finance these data use innovation projects .
in the process , we played the role of an observer .
every year we will receive nearly a thousand different data use proposals .
we need to sort out which data are more needed and which can be combined with some other data or which data could provide solutions for specific scenarios .
this information is extremely useful for the government regulatory departments and companies .
we mentioned earlier that they lacked a direction in deciding which data to open .
if we can collect the real needs .
we can help them open their data in a better and more targeted way .
at the same time , in this process .
we also found that such a mechanism offers a way for the two sides to communicate .
the two sides can negotiate on what data to share and what the shared data can be used for .
this mechanism offers the data users a channel to give feedback and suggestions .
in this way , a complete eco @-@ system is formed .
at last , I want to mention three points , about our experience in this process .
first , we believe that we should adopt an &quot; ecosystem thinking &quot; mindset .
I have repeatedly ad@@ ressed the importance of an ecosystem because open data is not an independent issue .
city innovation covers a wide range of topics , such as smart cities , citizen participation , and information disclosure .
these different parts should be combined and assembled together like Le@@ go bricks to form an innovation ecosystem .
second , we needed to renew our understanding towards open data .
is open data about generating different outcomes ?
it is true that the free flow of information can help promote the economic development and government effectiveness .
but its true value is to re@@ shape the processes .
governments and entre@@ prises could give Internet giants like Baidu , Ali@@ baba and T@@ enc@@ ent their data .
and these companies could develop sof@@ tw@@ ares that they need in one week or less .
only by opening up these data can we invite more people to take part in the competition in a fair way .
can we stimulate market demand and offer a way of communication .
this is the true value of open data .
ultimately , a diversified participation is the key .
this ecosystem cannot work if there are only data users who call for more data .
such an ecosystem is problematic too if it has only data providers .
only when each of us participate in the construction of such an ecosystem can &quot; data flow freely like blood . &quot;
only in this way can our city becomes a lively and dynamic organism and this might be the way a beautiful city is like in the future .
thank you !
hello , everyone .
my name is Hao Jie .
according to some online articles , fish has a mere seven @-@ second memory span .
we don &apos;t need to find out whether fish can only remember things for seven seconds .
what I &apos;m interested in is the philosophical short stories that compare the memory of humans with that of fish , and how these stories boast human superiority and complacency for having a longer memory span and higher intelligence , as well as the pret@@ entious pain that comes with being a more advanced life@@ form .
is it really the case ?
as an ordinary person , my memory span is longer than seven seconds .
however , when a person blindly follows the behavior of others , he or she will not be able to make rational choices or remember anything , which is called the band@@ wagon effect .
for example , if someone suddenly stood up during my speech , and ran out the door , you would think he or she might have something urgent to handle .
but if 20 people stood up and ran out of the door , their actions would have caught our attention .
what if it was 200 people ?
what if it was 200 people ?
let &apos;s close our eyes and imagine : 200 people stand up and run towards the door ; in this case , our instinct would be to follow them .
at that moment , your head would go blank , and you can &apos;t remember a single thing , not for seven seconds .
maybe the only thing you can remember at this point is to grab your cellphone .
the point I want to make with this example is that once people &quot; hop on the band@@ wagon , &quot; their minds are unable to function rationally and see the whole situation with a wider temporal span , due to the band@@ wagon effect .
the br@@ ainless behaviors and the lack of memory caused by band@@ wagon phenomenon can manifest in areas like financial investment , school selection , choosing partners and also , my topic today , block@@ chain .
for my speech today , I want to take you out of the context of China and look beyond the past few months .
I want to explore how block@@ chain has re@@ shaped economic entities , how it has already affected our lives as well as its impact on the future of humankind .
first , how block@@ chain has mod@@ ulated an economic entity ?
in the past two years , I have witnessed the introduction of e @-@ Resid@@ ency in Estonia .
the e @-@ Resid@@ ency program has three key characteristics .
B@@ lock@@ chain is the first and most distinct element .
the Estonian government is the first in the world to comprehensively adopt block@@ chain technologies in its administrative services .
a citizen &apos;s identity is protected by PK@@ I technology , PK@@ I public key system and e @-@ ID .
x @-@ Road makes sure a distributed data exchange layer of the country &apos;s public information .
public key system , e @-@ ID and X @-@ road all have utilized the technology of distributed ledger which is commonly known as block@@ chain .
the second feature is the smart policy framework .
to maximize the potential of block@@ chain technology , the Estonian government has established an intelligent policy framework , aiming to generate a policy standard for data by specifying which kind of data can be accessed by which type of third @-@ parties .
under this policy framework , business start @-@ ups can enjoy rapid development , our rights as consumers are well @-@ protected , and the government is able to respond to emerging industries promptly .
that is the second characteristic .
the third feature is online ID verification .
to apply for an Estonian e @-@ Resid@@ ency , the applicant must do two things at the local Estonian embassies in his or her own country : first is to go through the identity authentication ; second is to submit the bi@@ ome@@ trics .
after going through the ab@@ ov@@ em@@ entioned formalities , the applicant will receive an Estonian e @-@ Resid@@ ency card .
if the card@@ holder wishes to enjoy any service of the e @-@ Resid@@ ency system , he or she must log in with the card which serves as the only online verification that is endorsed by the government .
based on these three characteristics , the Estonian government has shared some of its digital resources with the world since 20@@ 14 .
at present , the Estonian e @-@ Resid@@ ency is at the beta version , and its digital community has opened up to the globe .
the key of e @-@ Resid@@ ency is to provide convenience to people in setting up and running a company online from anywhere in the world .
I was among the first to join the Estonian e @-@ Resid@@ ency .
at that time , there were less than 50 people in our entire real @-@ name digital community .
in the past two years , more and more people have joined the community and used e @-@ Resid@@ ency to launch companies , with a growing number of third @-@ party service providers coming to serve the community .
these service providers include Nasdaq Stock Market , Or@@ ac@@ li@@ ze and Mo@@ ther@@ ship , who can help us to manage our digital asset transactions efficiently .
banks like Change and organizations like the United Nations also joined the community .
as more and more third parties enter the community , you start to realize that this community has slowly transi@@ tioned into an economy .
according to internal statistics I received four days ago , the tax revenue contributed by this economy has exceeded the Estonian government &apos;s investment on this project .
that is a significant moment for me : to witness an economic entity entering a positive circle of rapid growth .
I have a bold prediction , that is , I think that the Estonian e @-@ Resid@@ ency will likely become the largest economic entity in Europe in the next five to ten years .
I have come to two conclusions in the past two years , and now I want to share my thoughts with you .
my first thought is that government @-@ led block@@ chain will be one of the future forms of economic entities .
based on the support of block@@ chain technology , a government can formulate intelligent policy framework and generate online ID@@ s , and the members of the digital community are free from the constraints of geography and nationality .
my second thought is that : the best way to achieve the full potential of block@@ chain is to get political recognition on a global scale .
to me , the value of a block@@ chain project is equal to the sum of scarcity and applicability multiplied by compatibility .
compatibility principally refers to the acceptance of governments in the world .
the more block@@ chain has been accepted , the higher the project value .
e @-@ Resid@@ ency is accepted by all governments around the world .
therefore , its overall value , or the value of the entire project , may be one of the largest economic entities in the future .
those are two of my revel@@ ations .
just now , we talked about how block@@ chain re@@ shapes our economy .
now , I would like to focus on our &quot; far@@ away future , &quot; that is , how block@@ chain will impact our lives .
I think the idea of the &quot; far@@ away future &quot; is dear to many modern people &apos;s hearts .
there is a ly@@ ric from the song &quot; M@@ ud@@ an River &quot; that goes : &quot; it is called the far@@ away future for it is always out of reach . &quot;
many of you may be more familiar with a quote from Gao Xia@@ os@@ ong : &quot; life is not just about drifting further every day but also about poems and the world beyond . &quot;
I think the concept of the world beyond reflects our dissatisfaction with the status quo and the longing for freedom and a better future .
for the person who said this quote , for the writer who came up with the ly@@ ric and for those of us who heard the song , we have enjoyed enough freedom as it is .
most of us have enjoyed social welfare .
we have smart@@ phones , and we can shop online at T@@ mall and Ta@@ obao and order food from EL@@ EM@@ E .
what kinds of people don &apos;t have freedom ?
they are the people who live in remote mountainous areas ; they are the people who reside in countries and regions with relatively backward financial systems .
they did not come to Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u Talk today .
they don &apos;t live in first @-@ tier cities like Beijing , Shanghai and Guangzhou , let alone global metropol@@ ises like London , New York and Madrid .
where are those people ?
they live in Ecuador , Venezuela , the mountains of Peru , and the sl@@ ums of New Delhi .
to cite myself as an example , I have a fund for investments in the high @-@ tech sector in Latin America .
more than 50 % of the population in Latin America doesn &apos;t have bank accounts .
it would be challenging to set up an account at a local bank , not to mention registering a company for business activities .
I want to remind you that , in today &apos;s commercial society , if you don &apos;t even have a bank account , you will be shack@@ led to a low living standard , struggling through daily tri@@ vi@@ ality .
this group of people is mu@@ ted .
the fact that their voices cannot be heard doesn &apos;t mean they do not exist .
they do exist , and there are many of them in the world .
how can block@@ chain technology help this group of people break free from their daily struggles and embrace freedom to enjoy a better future ?
this is a female entrepreneurship course at the Indian Institute of Technology , Delhi .
as we all know , women from third @-@ world countries are tend to be closed @-@ off and conservative and are least likely to have access to scientific and technological benefits .
this project helps women in Delhi to turn their business ideas into reality .
I want to introduce you to a beautiful girl , and her name is Sak@@ shi .
Sak@@ shi has discovered a business opportunity .
she found that young people in India are living far away from their parents &quot; and they need a new way to maintain the family bond between the two generations .
therefore , she started Z@@ ing@@ o@@ Box .
what is Z@@ ing@@ o@@ Box ?
Z@@ ing@@ o@@ Box offers young people the service to quickly customize heartfelt gifts for their parents for family bonding .
thanks to e @-@ Resid@@ ency , Sak@@ shi was able to register her company , set up her own bank account , and eventually turned her dream into a reality .
what I want to say is that block@@ chain can not only help girls like Sak@@ shi , but also every one of us .
my point can be best explained by cross @-@ border payment , as many of us have talked about it before .
here is one example of cross @-@ border payment .
a wine dealer in Shi@@ ji@@ az@@ huang of Hebei Province wants to import wine from a Chil@@ ean win@@ ery .
how can the dealer make the transaction ?
how can the dealer transfer the money to the client ?
first , he needs to go to a bank in Shi@@ ji@@ az@@ huang , exchange the RMB into dollars and transfer the dollars to an affiliated account in New York .
the American bank will transfer the money to a Chil@@ ean bank , where the dollars will be exchanged again into pes@@ o .
money transaction is just like the process of mailing .
it &apos;s hard to comprehend that in this digital era , the digi@@ tized currency needs to go through the same procedures as things do in the post office to reach the client &apos;s account .
this has reminded me of a poem written by Mu@@ xin , called &quot; Time was S@@ lower . &quot;
now , let &apos;s read the verses .
time was S@@ lower .
time was slower in the past .
carriage , horse , mail needs time a little bit .
each cash transfer requires days to complete .
so slow , one can only love once in life .
so slow , it takes three days to receive the payment .
the point I want to make is that block@@ chain technology has had a profound impact on us , free@@ ing us from our current constraints .
the third issue I want to address is how block@@ chain will influence humankind in a more distant future to a deeper extent .
genesis 11 of Old Testament and the Bible describes : all men came together to build the Tower of Bab@@ el that may reach to the heavens .
the Lord then confused their language so that men could not communicate and cooperate ; thus the Tower of Bab@@ el failed .
since then , we humans have embarked on a long journey of trying to understand each other .
I have been thinking about how people from different countries and cultural backgrounds can understand each other ?
I think mutual exchanges and conversations cannot reach a level of deep understanding .
in the past decade or so , I have visited many countries and met with international students , overseas Chinese , as well as entrepreneurs and government delegations .
no matter how long they have stayed or how joyous our conversations are , the level of understanding we have established is superficial , after a mere exchange of business cards .
for me , the best way to understand each other is through business exchanges , because a good business relationship is a guarantee for a win @-@ win situation , which requires one party to see things from the other party &apos;s perspective .
I have come to know that people who have a deep understanding of their countries are mainly businessmen , not well @-@ learned scholars .
speaking from my experience , we specialize in investment activities in Latin America .
therefore , we have to read materials related to those countries .
however , no matter how much books we read , it &apos;s not as meaningful as the conversations we had with the investors in our venture capital fund or the entrepreneur teams we have invested in .
I need to consider what the big picture is from their perspectives carefully .
I need to map out the details of the entire operation me@@ ticul@@ ously .
if there is a technology that can make it easy for people from different countries and cultural backgrounds to set up companies and bank accounts , allowing them to execute their ideas and do business together efficiently , then this technology will be the new Tower of Bab@@ el for humans .
in conclusion , I think block@@ chain technology has been re@@ shaping our economies , our lives , and it will have a ground @-@ breaking impact on the human race in a distant future .
it is my sincere and firm conviction that our future will be a splendid one .
thank you all !
hi !
finally , here I am .
the organizer invited me here a few days to talk about my work and share my thoughts .
so , today , I &apos;d like to talk about a very substantive topic .
as people in the field of art , especially public art .
what can we do ?
what is public art for ?
I can see that many people are staring at me with questions on their face .
actually , I got many questions in my head , too .
before answering that , I think I should introduce public art to you .
about public art , if you put it formally and seriously , it is actually a unique way of creation and a special language that you can use to answer public questions .
it over@@ turns some of the previous laws of artistic creation .
because its object of concern , creative methods and evaluation standards are totally different .
so , public art actually emphasizes individual experience .
it pays attentions to personal feelings and highlights public participation .
for example , if I &apos;m talking to myself in the mirror right now , it &apos;s personal art , and when I &apos;m talking to many other people , it &apos;s public art .
so , I think it is the essence of public art to pay attention to the people and the change of the whole picture .
it highlights the participation of the public and the dialogue with them .
public art aims at putting forward questions and ultimately answering them .
its evaluation criteria are also different from those of previous arts .
for example , it emphasizes that the quality of art and the influence of individuals should be ultimately oriented to the improvement of people &apos;s spiritual outlook and the influence of local areas .
OK , I &apos;ve said a lot , but it still doesn &apos;t seem clear enough .
let me give you a simple example .
maybe you can understand what public art actually is .
we all know that at the beginning of this century , the 9@@ 11 incident almost changed the course of global history , and it basically sub@@ verted and questioned the American spirit .
when the two planes rushed toward the tall buildings , the spirit of the US was instantly shattered by terrorism .
the public image of New York City suddenly turned into a heap of ruins .
you can look back at how pan@@ icked people fled the city in grief and fear when the twin towers fell .
a few years later , the mayor of New York City brought in a Danish artist , Eli@@ ass@@ on .
he worked with natural elements , and then he made a couple of water@@ falls for the city .
he also made a sun in London , and a rainbow in A@@ ar@@ h@@ us , his hometown in Denmark .
this is New York after 9@@ 11 .
the mayor thought that the city had made everyone insecure , and the American spirit was dying .
to boost the spirit and confidence of the citizens , he spent USD 15 million to invite the artist to build four artificial water@@ falls .
hoping to re @-@ establish the image of the city with human creativity and ignite its vitality .
it &apos;s a stunning sight to behold as a gigantic waterfall plun@@ ks under the Brooklyn Bridge from a height of 100 meters , the city landscape became again stunning .
when the mayor proposed this plan , it was questioned by many people , because it was taxpayers &quot; money .
USD 15 million , or nearly RMB 100 million , for just four art works , that is a lot of money .
the artist and the mayor of New York said , &quot; It &apos;s definitely worth it . it will bring at least USD 55 million to the city . &quot;
after the completion of these four works , they brought in about USD 69 million in four months for New York &apos;s travel , lodging and transportation industries .
you see , the creativity of art can bring new impetus to the city .
not only can it help the city regain its confidence , but also enhance the driving force of urban development .
the artist also made a sun at the T@@ ate Gallery on the Thames River in London , England .
it &apos;s made up of thousands of light bulbs .
in fact , people don &apos;t come here to see an artificial sun .
as we all know , London is known as the City of Fo@@ g .
people have a deep desire for the sun .
it actually brings warmth and satisfaction to people &apos;s hearts .
when the sun appeared above the T@@ ate Gallery , all the visitors could not help but take off their coats and lie down in the hall .
they don &apos;t come to see the work , they come to bas@@ k in the sun .
when the &quot; sunshine &quot; penetr@@ ates your skin and directly warms your heart , you can imagine st@@ rolling on the beach with your lover or family on a sunny afternoon .
this work over@@ turns the inherent appearance of a city , and allows all the audience to open the wings of imagination and re @-@ perceive the temperature of the city .
he also made a rainbow in A@@ ar@@ h@@ us .
as we all know , rain@@ bows are instantaneous and un@@ re@@ achable , but he solidi@@ fied them on a tall building , so that all the visitors can enter the rainbow to see the city .
then we can enjoy the unique social landscape we see inside the rainbow and the outside world we behold through it .
I believe you can understand what I am talking about now , right ?
&quot; public art &quot; is actually a form of public culture , a form of life and an aesthetic art .
its core value is to re@@ shape the place through the wisdom and creation of artists .
local re@@ modeling needs diverse art to open our imagination of art and culture .
local re@@ modeling is also to rem@@ old the spiritual values and aesthetic significance of local cultural connotation .
so , what should we do ?
we have three principles .
adapting to local conditions , guiding in the light of the general trend and varying with each individual .
paying attention to local conditions help us make the most suitable works to advance the communication between the local place and the outside world .
the general trend means focusing on what the people really want .
public art should have a dialogue with the public , invite the public to participate , and let local people enjoy its wisdom .
so we need to act in the light of the general trend .
varying with each individual means that each participant will bring about changes in the artistic context , and each artist will bring about different methods and final results .
rather than saying that public art is an art , I think it is actually a test of human &apos;s ability to harness social resources .
therefore , local re@@ modeling according to local conditions must show the wisdom and methodology of public art , such as beauti@@ fying space .
this is the New York City subway .
since 2001 , the New York subway has invited an artist to make a public artwork there , Life Under@@ ground .
he made interesting stories of people and animals into statues and put them in the subway .
when you shuttle in the crowd , you can stop to enjoy them , enjoy the more beautiful space .
in French subway , you can also see a nice replica of the Lou@@ v@@ re bou@@ tique , waiting in the subway .
while you wait for the train , you can talk to Rod@@ in and enjoy his masterpiece , The Th@@ in@@ ker .
this is the Athens subway .
Athens is an ancient city of civilization .
its subway links many historic sites of civilization .
the creator of the space deliberately duplicate historical relics in a one @-@ to @-@ one scale .
when you take the subway , it &apos;s like walking through history .
this is an airport in Singapore .
an artist from Art + com in Germany connected thousands of rain@@ drops digit@@ ally and then integrated them with music .
when you are waiting for the plane , the rain@@ drops will dance to the music .
dancing rain and beautiful music will ease your waiting boredom .
also , I think public art can also create land@@ marks , including water@@ falls , the sun and the rainbow we just mentioned .
unlike pure beauti@@ fication art , public art tends to shape works with landscape significance according to local history and culture .
for example , Angel of the North is standing in the north of Scotland .
that area used to be a coal mine and an industrial base .
but with the integration of the global economy , heavy industry gradually withdrew from these developed areas .
these cities have gradually become a space dominated by tourism .
so , many of the local people who used to work in heavy industry , in memory of their way of life .
invited an artist to make a huge 140 @-@ ton sculp@@ ture@@ .It un@@ folds like a Boeing 7@@ 47 .
this sculpture has been guarding the factory and people &apos;s memory .
here is another one .
there used to be many workers in Seattle , too .
another artist made the hammer man sculpture .
he fashioned the ham@@ mer@@ man &apos;s arm into a mechanism that would strike once every forty minutes , many times a day .
the sound of strike is telling people that before the urbanization process .
there were many working people who kept ham@@ mering here and made the city what it is today .
this is Love , a famous artwork , with many versions .
this is one of them .
it is placed in the midst of a constant stream of people to help re @-@ recognize the role of love in our life .
and to remind us that love is everything .
thirdly , I would like to say that public art can help us remember .
there was a dictator in Chile named Pin@@ och@@ et .
he rav@@ ished many local people during his decades of rule .
the dictator was severely punished in the end , but the dead could not be brought back .
an artist built more than five hundred monuments to the victims .
every time you walk through these 30 steps , you see this dark space .
the image of the five hundred victims will slowly emerge before your eyes , then flash and disappear .
those five hundred images will be et@@ ched in your mind .
it &apos;s a memorial to the victims .
another incident occurred in Mexico in around 1993 to 2001 .
in nearly a decade , more than 500 teenage girls were killed and nearly 5,000 people were missing in this Mexican city .
the case is still un@@ solved .
an artist put the shoes of 500 victims in the squares of one city after another to remind girls to protect themselves and to express condemnation of the crime .
during World War II , 19@@ ,000 soldiers were sacrificed in one day on a French battlefield .
an artist collected more than 1,@@ 900 pe@@ bbles on a beach , marked them with numbers and placed them to show the cruelty of the war .
regarding the transformation of industrial wast@@ eland , many industrial remains in Germany are now placed in cities .
how to reuse them ?
we need the wisdom of art .
it is also the most popular and most challenging subject of urban cultural operation ability to inject good artistic contents into industrial relics and turn them into cultural landscapes or living facilities .
many of the sites of heavy industry in the US and Europe , including Germany , have become cultural and recreational parks .
another theme is environment protection .
an artist has discovered prehistoric civilizations at the bottom of a beautiful bay in the Gulf of Mexico that experienced a volcanic earthquake .
he re@@ assembled more than 500 sculptures and structures based on the information about prehistoric civilizations .
three or five years later , the sculptures grew together with the sea floor creatures .
coral and shrimp have made their homes on the sculptures , creating new underwater landscapes .
there used to be more than 20,000 professional divers around the bay , but now there are 200,000 .
tourists from all over the world want to see this underwater wonder .
art can also solve social problems .
this is India .
there are many cases of violence against women in India .
an artist designed two chairs on many streets of India to let people sit down and talk to women and learn about their thoughts .
such equal dialogue can ease the tension between men and women .
art is therapeutic .
in Rwanda , Lily Y@@ eh , a Chinese @-@ American artist , built monuments to people killed in the genocide .
she used art as public education programs and healing programs for the local residents .
to me , public art is for the public and it is in @-@ the @-@ site and it is of artistic quality .
in @-@ the @-@ site is the form of public art .
the artistic quality is the nature of public art .
public art is essentially for the public .
its subject is certainly not the artist nor the government , but the people .
the government and the artist are participants and en@@ abl@@ ers .
the government should develop policies and provide public resources as support .
and the artist should use artistic language and methods to activate the participation of the public and meet their aesthetic needs .
so that they can express their aesthetic needs in artistic forms .
in fact , this is the embodiment and recognition of their value .
public art has been evolving across the world , especially during the process of urbanization .
it embodies the culture , stances , views and wisdom of different nations .
last but not least , I would like to conclude with one sentence .
we hope to see art back to our life through public participation and let it warm our space .
thank you !
good afternoon .
I &apos;m glad to be here and share with you some of my ideas .
the theme for today &apos;s seminar is Design Th@@ inking and the Third Wis@@ dom .
this was a concept that I first put forward 5 or 6 years ago .
the first wisdom is science , and the second wisdom is art .
actually the first wisdom should be design .
but I have to be polite .
what we human beings first learned was design , not science nor arts .
we learned those things at a much later stage .
we now continue our discussion about the future of mankind .
what is the future of mankind ?
what we want is sustainable development .
the prevailing development trend , or the nowadays &quot; logic , suggests that we should strive for green hills , clear waters and a pastoral @-@ poem @-@ like lifestyle .
am I right ?
it is comfortable to live a life this way , right ?
but what lies beneath the green hills and clear waters ?
the law of the jungle .
back to the topic we are discussing today .
what you hear may be false , but seeing is believing , is it really so ?
seeing isn &apos;t believing , and do not overes@@ timate your sense of vision .
it is nonsense to say that you should follow your perception .
our eyes are not as good as eag@@ les .
our noses are inferior to those of dogs .
but we have our brains and consciousness .
which are the essential principles of design .
design is like a seedling , and design is in fact the closest thing to the human society .
the core of design is people @-@ oriented .
people are not an abstract conception .
but very specific individuals in our society .
science can benefit mankind .
but can also destroy mankind .
the pursuit of art is to seek perfection , and all is about self actu@@ alization .
design and art are closely connected with each other .
however , there is one major difference between them .
art studies the rainbow set off by the waves .
while the focus of design is whether the sea level has risen .
design must be an essential thinking method in the future .
we should never solely depend on science .
there are way too many unmanned technologies nowadays , and eventually our planet will become a no @-@ man land .
when we ask this question to an old farmer , does the Sun revol@@ ve around the Earth , or the Earth resolve around the Sun ?
his eyes will tell him that the Sun resol@@ ves around the Earth .
is that true ? not at all .
our naked eyes are not able to see the surrounding systems .
and there are way too many elements within these systems .
that is why our brain is important to us , and that is why we human beings can evolve with time .
we are able to live in today &apos;s world , because our brain knows how to think .
our brain is occupied by the thoughts of making money and competitions , thus creating a chaotic world .
we now say that there are many unjust and unfair things in the world .
what are the requirements of design ?
true design should serve the best interest of the general public , and everyone should have his share .
it is pointless to occupy all the available resources and think of only making money .
Zhu Guang@@ q@@ ian once said a sentence , and it happened to be mentioned by a teacher today .
and the sentence is &quot; Beauty is never uti@@ lit@@ arian . &quot;
we designers value highly of the true , the good and the beautiful .
you can &apos;t be good if you are not true .
and you are never beautiful if you are not true and not good .
what is beauty ?
beauty should not be uti@@ lit@@ arian .
but it is a uti@@ lit@@ arian world , isn &apos;t it ?
uti@@ lit@@ arianism prevails in this world .
the law of this present world is the law of uti@@ lit@@ arianism .
if we human beings want to continue our survival and not destroy ourselves .
we must be very clear that we should resist uti@@ lit@@ arianism and reflect the true beauty of mankind .
we must think hard .
we need things , objects and tools when they are necessary for us to do things .
but we are not in favor of scienti@@ sm or materialism .
according to Chinese philosophy , when we say Shi@@ wu in Chinese , shi , which means object , is always placed before wu , which means materials .
object has a top priority in terms of time and logic .
we only need tools when necessary .
but now we fight for tools without realizing the key objective . we are v@@ ying for innovation aim@@ lessly .
innovation itself is only a means , but not an objective .
we first need to figure out the meaning of xin in the Chinese phrase chu@@ ang@@ xin .
the purpose of having innovation is for the best interest of mankind and to facilitate the growth of society .
but innovation is never meant to kill people or commit a crime .
we must be clear about the purpose of innovations .
we Chinese people are reasonable people , and that is why I have invented a term called Mat@@ ter@@ ology .
we should be well aware of our development stage .
it is true that we are progressing rapidly and we have solved the problem of food and clothing .
why is our next generation in need of transformation and upgrade ?
because we have to .
they now say China is the world &apos;s second largest manufacturing power@@ house , and China will soon become the no@@ .1 .
however , those are not entirely made @-@ in @-@ China products .
when we talk about z@@ hiz@@ ao , meaning manufacturing in English , we need to understand the true meaning of zhi in the first place .
Zhi is referred to as standard , norm and procedure .
however all these concepts are imported from other countries .
at least 80 % of Chinese enterprises are SMEs .
Mr. Cai is an expert on SME studies .
can our SMEs invent or develop new technologies by themselves ?
new technologies are all imported ones .
among these SMEs , 60 % to 70 % of them are small and micro businesses .
how can these SMEs change the existing systems at all ?
that is why we say that it is absolutely right to make the transition from made @-@ in @-@ China to a major manufacturer , then to created @-@ in @-@ China .
it is an important step we must take , but how can we make such a transition from processing @-@ based manufacturing to independent manufacturing ?
Mr. Mi@@ ao Yu just mentioned that , in terms of manufacturing strength , China was within the third ec@@ hel@@ on in the world .
and the 19th CPC National Congress pointed out that China was still at its initial stage of development .
we should be well aware of this fact .
I will tell you a few more examples from my personal experience .
I visited St@@ ut@@ t@@ g@@ art in Germany in 1981 .
that was an auto city .
many famous auto brands , such as Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sche , had settled there .
of course I wanted to visit Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z .
I was shocked when entering its factory for the first time .
I was among the first batch of Chinese who visited a Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z factory .
I immediately noticed that every job post within the factory , including headquarters office , standard office , production department and the production line , had employed people with black hair , obviously being yellow @-@ race people .
I said to myself that China indeed had done an impressive job .
but later I was told that they were Japanese from TO@@ YO@@ TA .
the boss of TO@@ YO@@ TA succeeded in convincing Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z to accept his fee @-@ based internship program , allowing TO@@ YO@@ TA to send 100 inter@@ ns each year for 3 years .
who were these 100 people ?
they were not elite professionals , such as general secretary , professor and expert .
they came together as a team from top to bottom , even with people working at the production lines .
I returned back China in 1984 .
and in 1987 I brought a group of Chinese entrepreneurs to visit the same Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z factory once again .
when I entered the factory , I asked them , &quot; Why do these Japanese people refuse to leave ? &quot;
I was told that they were from Hy@@ und@@ ai of the South Korea .
think about it .
China first dispatched students to overseas countries in the late Qing Dynasty .
but we have never seen such kind of talent dispatch program at all .
it is nothing to do with the money issue ; the problem lies in our heads .
I just mentioned that seeing was believing .
it is important for China to improve its design level .
what matters most to the development of China is not the problem @-@ solving skill , nor the use of tool , but the conceptual issue .
we care too much about the elite elements .
take a look at the essays from the design circle , as it is not appropriate for me to commend on other disciplines .
what I can tell is that the entire essay is about elements .
elements are omni@@ potent , right ?
there isn &apos;t any pure element at all .
elements are all born in a system and are never isolated .
that is why we must apply our achievements made in a laboratory to the paddy fields .
you know the laboratory has a perfectly controlled environment , including absolute vacuum state and absolute thermal insulation .
however there isn &apos;t any such an ideal state in the reality .
everything in the real world is element .
I was very thankful to V@@ on Ber@@ tal@@ an@@ ffy .
when I returned back to China in 1984 .
I spent an entire summer in reading a book .
it was not a book about design , but V@@ on Ber@@ tal@@ an@@ ffy &apos;s General System Theory .
it is a systematic world , and nothing will remain in isolation .
you see it , or you don &apos;t see it , but things exist anyway .
that is why we need to pay close attention to system and mechanism , which is a crucial step for our transformation and upgrade .
and only by doing so can we present our Chinese solutions to the international community .
a community of shared future for mankind is never meant to be an individual enjoying fine wine at a villa alone .
you must have known this situation well .
people nowadays are so eager for buying a house .
a house should never be the ultimate goal for our human beings .
now we have identified buying a house as our primary goal , but actually we should be in pursuit of home .
these are two totally different concepts .
but we are still in pursuit of house .
when we don &apos;t change this kind of mentality , it is pointless for us to continue talking about the transformation and upgrade .
we need to treat design as the third wisdom and should never rely on imported technologies .
running workshops won &apos;t do any help to improve our problem @-@ solving skills .
but our existing design education and the entire society are exactly doing these .
it is therefore important for higher education authorities and enterprises that cultivate designers to realize the gravity of this problem and make a sound decision in facilitating transformation and upgrade .
think about it , manufacturing is so important to China .
and we need to stick to such a principle for over 10,000 years .
what is the status quo of our manufacturing ?
maybe what I say is too absolute .
but to me , we already have established industries , but have never achieved the industrialization .
think about the wives of accountants of some SMEs .
every mil@@ ler draws water to his own mill .
that is a jungle @-@ style competition .
people now invent a new word to describe competition , they call it brand competition ; but I &apos;m not going to say nice about it .
is it possible for every enterprise to build their brand ?
it will cost about 30,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan to buy a logo designed by a master designer from the Academy of Arts and Design , Tsinghua University .
however , it will cost you at least 500,000 yuan to work out a brand @-@ building solution .
when every enterprise invests 1 million yuan on branding , how many resources have been wasted ?
Pin@@ pa@@ i in Chinese has two characters , pin and pa@@ i .
we only help enhance the reputation of the enterprise .
but the real quality of products or services is not paid enough attention .
what exactly are we after ?
we are only after those visible things .
I have witnessed too many strange things . I attended the primary school in 1949 and grew up together with the People &apos;s Republic of China .
I have heard many times of this sentence , &quot; Bu@@ ying ships is better than building ships ; and char@@ tering ships is better than buying ships . &quot;
Chang@@ chun Auto Plant was first established in 1957 .
and its first year &apos;s production volume of Ji@@ ef@@ ang trucks exceeded the combined production volume of trucks in Japan .
very impressive , isn &apos;t it ?
in 1987 , the Plant still produced the same brand of truck .
with a loading capacity of 4.5 tons and the same wheel base .
we used the trucks to carry many things , including machines , grains , cotton and people .
what &apos;s wrong with Chinese people ?
China is a nation with over 5,000 years &quot; civilization .
we only have 30 years &quot; history in auto industry .
but we are still not exactly sure what auto industry is .
our production volume and quality have improved .
but in 1987 our loading capacity still remained 4.5 tons .
we later learned that we only knew what but didn &apos;t know why .
that was a production line imported from the previous Soviet Union during the Second World War .
Soviet Union was making trucks that would be used to carry cann@@ ons in the battle@@ fields .
the trucks must not be too long or too big , however , the trucks must have a relatively large trac@@ tive force .
we have been working in blindness for over 30 years .
and all our automobile technicians receive their training at the Chang@@ chun No. 1 Auto Plant .
we keep talking about technological revolution .
but what have happened to made @-@ in @-@ China cars ?
take a look at those beautifully designed auto advertisements .
family members are inside a SU@@ V ready for a family trip .
what a lovely picture !
but think about it .
all those core auto parts , including the engine , gear@@ box and chassis , are imported from foreign countries .
we are all immersed in material comforts .
and the commercial advertisements keep persuading us to shop and occupy things .
we were told that Nanjing Autom@@ obile Group finally developed first made @-@ in @-@ China engine three years ago , and the company even had three patent technologies .
we are of course very happy about it , and finally made @-@ in @-@ China machines will have a Chinese heart .
however our hearts sank once again after our trip to the factory of Nanjing Autom@@ obile Group .
the entire production line was full of made @-@ in @-@ Germany technologies , made @-@ in @-@ Germany equipment and made @-@ in @-@ Germany tools .
Chinese engineers told us that Chinese people were smart and creative .
however , without the availability of this made @-@ in @-@ Germany manufacturing platform , they were unable to come up with the invention by themselves .
what exactly are we after nowadays ? we need to think hard of this question .
this was a figure 5 years ago .
for every USD of gross national production , We consumed energy more than eleven times of that in Japan , more than seven times of that in the Western Europe .
can &apos;t we undergo transformation and upgrade ?
what do we think when undergoing transformation and upgrade ?
the exhibition hall of the Academy of Arts and Design , Tsinghua University once held a GU@@ CC@@ I launch event in 2010 .
fan Bing@@ bing was invited to attend the event .
it took a week to set up a stage with a cost exceeding 8 million yuan , and the stage was immediately dismantled after a show lasting for 20 minutes .
this kind of thing happens in this world on a daily basis .
and we even call it a &quot; commercial design . &quot;
we are all obsessed with this kind of thing , as if we were doing design .
some of us even feel proud , &quot; I once took part in that grand design . &quot;
the investment of auto shows held in Beijing , Shanghai and Shenzhen and other places in the world would be a few hundred times of that of GU@@ CC@@ I launch event .
are we supposed to feel proud of it ?
no , we design circle should feel shameful about it , and it is absolutely dis@@ graceful .
could we simply organize a launch event with much reduced cost ?
of course we can .
we don &apos;t have that kind of innovation .
we are obsessed by the idea of catching up and making money quickly .
we expect the whole process to be quick , stable and to be finished as soon as possible .
these are illusions based on quick sand , but we are only after short @-@ term interests .
take a look at the recent &quot; Double Elev@@ enth Shopping Car@@ ni@@ val . &quot;
I don &apos;t need to say anything further .
the rocket @-@ climbing @-@ like increase in its transaction volume is no different from committing a crime .
it is a waste of resources , and the consumption concept of younger generation is badly corro@@ ded . are we out of mind ?
is it likely to be the Chinese solution ?
is it the community with a shared future for mankind ?
our society is not sober at all .
and we are troubled by some conceptual issues .
when we are talking about beauty , what exactly is beauty ?
anything that is bigger , more extravagant and larger in number is considered as more beautiful .
of course extravagant items have their beauty .
but there are other beau@@ ties in the world , including the beauty of simplicity , right ?
look at the bronze ware , which has a savage and horri@@ fic beauty , and the beauty of Greek tragedy .
we seem to have no idea of beauty at all .
you can find something beautiful in every house .
and you don &apos;t need to visit the For@@ bidden City or the Lou@@ v@@ re Museum to look for beauty .
what can you discover by visiting the For@@ bidden City or the Lou@@ v@@ re Museum ?
the beauty of emper@@ ors .
you are not allowed to have the beauty of emper@@ ors , are you ?
we were taught , when we were little , that those were the most classic beau@@ ties .
are you having an emperor &apos;s dream in your mind ?
we must be clear about the nature of beauty .
beauty is not about part@@ ying .
pigs in winter are well fed and sn@@ ore on the ha@@ yst@@ ack when the sunshine is warm .
do you find anything beautiful in this picture ?
it is a kind of sensory stimulation .
but we now all mistak@@ enly treat sensory stimulation as a form of beauty .
we Chinese haven &apos;t figured out these concepts yet , despite that China is a great nation with over 5,000 years &quot; civilization .
but in nature it is a form of design , which belongs to a commercial language .
to be straightforward , commerce is the most important thing in the world .
even science and technology should make way for commercial success .
what exactly is fashion ?
think about it , only those who live a short life can be called being fashionable , right ?
when you live a longer life , you are not fashionable at all .
only a short @-@ lived item can be called being fashionable .
was Steve Jobs a great designer ?
there are different versions of Apple phones , ranging from 4 , 4@@ S , 5 , 5@@ S , 6 , 6@@ S , 7 , 7@@ Plus , 8 and 8@@ X .
does that make money ?
what you do is to pay for it .
is it the real design ?
the entire world has made a mistake , assuming that this is a genuine design .
of course we are in need of these gadgets .
however , we need to restore the relations of production in the first place .
how many resources have been wasted in the world ?
what exactly is the real design ?
design is never meant to be something that appears in front of our eyes , something that is cool , fancy and fashionable .
design is the labor behind these things .
design is the relations of production , but not productivity itself .
we all treat design as a form of productivity mistak@@ enly .
it is an adjustment of various relations .
with the relations adjusted , the industrial revolution gave birth to the industrial design .
due to this kind of adjustment , design is placed ahead of the actual mass production .
that is why in a factory the blueprint has a role of giving orders .
and any mistake in the blueprint will result in tens of thousands yuan of economic loss .
handicraft art however is very different .
a mistake will only affect the quality of one particular product .
we Chinese have a saying of Su@@ i@@ ji Ying@@ bian , which means &quot; to adapt oneself to the changing circumstances . &quot;
it is a very classic handic@@ r@@ af@@ tsman &apos;s thinking .
wait and see , right ?
if I have made a mistake in the cur@@ ving process .
I can add something new , be it a worm or anything else .
a handic@@ r@@ af@@ tsman needs to adapt to the changing circumstances .
however , it is a sort of clever@@ ness in trivial matters .
the industrial revolution is referred to as mass production .
before mass production , key elements , including demand , production , circulation , usage and recycling , must have been carefully considered .
this is the real design .
design is not meant to something beautiful , cool or modern .
I once drew this picture in 1987 and kept explaining this concept to other people .
but people didn &apos;t understand , and kept questioning the nature of design@@ ----@@ is it a science major or an art major ?
when you look at this picture , do you think it necessary to continue such a meaningless debate ?
a cup is called a product in a factory and a commodity in a shop .
the same cup is called an article for use at home , and a waste in a garbage can .
design needs to address contradictions encountered during the process of production , circulation , usage and recycling , which is a social problem .
what kind of discipline is design then ?
it is a horizontal discipline , not a science , not an art , and not humanities either .
to me , design is a discipline that can help human beings solve problems in the future .
design is not an engineering , not a science , not an art , not humanities .
this kind of classification is outdated , about which I am sure .
we human beings are always moving forward , so is the discipline classification .
this change will also bring about mindset change .
I defined design as a form of creative activity back in 1985 .
however , design in China was not creative at all .
therefore people invented new words , such as innovative design or design innovation .
but , in reality , design is only a form of creative activity .
the purpose of design is not for money , house or car .
what is the purpose of design ?
it is to find a healthy and reasonable lifestyle .
and this is the Chinese solution and a community of shared future for mankind .
otherwise it won &apos;t work at all .
you have to follow the western logic , which is the law of the jungle .
it is understandable that we all want to build our brands , right ?
we all want our names to be known by others .
we will give names to newborn babies , names that are auspicious , right ?
but the name itself can &apos;t guarantee the future success of a baby .
that &apos;s why Chinese people are so particular about giving names .
if the name is not correct , the words will not ring true .
however , name giving differs from brand building campaign ;
otherwise we will be in big troubles .
the name must be good , but you need to cultivate your brand , right ?
calligraphy and painting works of celebrities now become popular selling items .
for example , a painting drawn by Jack Ma was sold at a price of 35 million USD , oh no , 35 million Hong Kong dollar .
it &apos;s a strange phenomenon in China , allowing a person to fill a post without real qualifications .
aren &apos;t many brands in China doing exactly the same ?
in the 1990s , Taiwan scholar Lin P@@ ans@@ ong visited China , bo@@ asting his newly developed corporate identity ( CI ) scheme .
rainbow TV plant in Shaanxi Province ended up buying his plan with a cost of 2.5 million yuan .
how is the TV brand now ?
does it still survive today ?
the brand has long gone .
there are many disqualified things , and people would rather work on superficial things .
what is the character that the Chinese value ?
why is it called a symbol of traditional Chinese value ?
there are three ways to interpret the word &quot; good character &quot; in Chinese .
the first sign of lacking a decent character is when you are extremely hungry and would devour food like an animal .
there is nothing graceful about that , isn &apos;t it ?
the second scene of a lack of grace is about the n@@ ou@@ ve@@ au ric@@ he .
those who would use a fleet of Rol@@ ls @-@ Ro@@ yce on a wedding day , is that graceful ?
of course it is no grace at all , and people will criticize it , right ?
this is the luxurious gold color of i@@ phone .
think about it . don &apos;t we all want to be ins@@ an@@ ely rich so that we could show off around .
the third sign of a good character is about our diet habits .
about loos@@ ing weight and being vegetarian .
think about it , the foods Chinese people waste on the dinner table every year can feed 20 million people for a year .
are you still in favor of extravag@@ ance ?
at least 15 % of the world &apos;s populations are te@@ e@@ tering on the brink of starvation .
are you still in favor of extravag@@ ance ?
aren &apos;t we advocating a community of shared future for mankind ?
how can we be a good role model ?
ice@@ ber@@ gs are beautiful , aren &apos;t they ?
but we need to beware of the invisible part below the water .
do you still remember the movie Titanic ?
a watch@@ man warned that there was an iceberg up@@ front .
while another watch@@ man said , &quot; That is still far away . &quot;
then they colli@@ ded .
what designers should focus on are the invisible thing beneath .
while commercial interests focus on those visible things above the water .
we should therefore understand clearly the true nature of design .
design is never meant to be a business .
we now keep talking about business models every day .
discussing business with real businessmen is as if you display your slight skil@@ s@@ l before an expert .
it is a joke , isn &apos;t it ?
will other people respect you at all ?
not the least .
you have no arguments nor logic .
the sign of China &apos;s real development is that our products are not on the &quot; shelves of global supermarket . &quot;
not at the &quot; Amazon website &quot; or &quot; Ali@@ baba website . &quot;
but in the lab of Germany and the US .
take a look at any decent Chinese enterprise , the equipment and devices that are used in the R &amp; D stage , including wrench and abrasive paper , are imported .
if component workers we have employed in Africa have dropped a wrench into the mud , nobody will pick it up .
and we will spend another 5 USD to buy a new one .
that is how we become a world power .
therefore , we must use our brain , learn by heart and should not merely follow our feeling .
extravagant things won &apos;t last .
this photo is more illustr@@ ative .
we are more accustomed to the behavioral pattern on the left .
the fish in Guangdong is very tasty , and then we will import the fish to Beijing .
however , the meat quality of fish will start to deteriorate on the second or the third year .
the photo on the right features the importance of analyzing .
people will analyze fish DNA , temperature of the fish growing environment , fish feed among others .
so that people can grow the same type of fish in Beijing .
have you noticed any pattern yet ?
all those foreign things that had been imported to China since the reform and opening up are still imported these days .
whenever there is something that foreign countries would not share with us .
we would act on our own and the result we get is often satisfying .
what does it mean ?
people are lazy , and they would rather rely on their eyes and other sensory organs .
when I have already had a walking stick , why should I walk on my own ?
that is why we are used to laziness .
however we are forced to find an independent development path when others have refused to help us .
we must realize that we have to follow an independent development road .
Dao patterns itself on what is natural .
and the nature has already revealed us the true nature of design .
what is nature ?
nature creates everything and reveals to us the underlying rules and principles .
the external factors will affect the course of events .
we are occupied by the thoughts of principle , technology , equipment , appearance , shape and color ; however these matters belong to the second step .
we rely on imported technology , so we only focus on the second half of the design , but design in the first half is much more important .
Yangtze River and the Yellow River both originated in the San@@ ji@@ ang@@ yuan area .
why is the water of Yellow River full of yellow sand ?
why does the water of Yellow River freeze in winter ?
why does water in Yangtze River become tor@@ rent and waterfall , and later become lakes and marsh@@ es downstream ?
why ?
is it because of the difference of water ?
it is because the weather and terrain conditions differ .
the purpose of design is to tackle a problem based on the actual condition and seek truth from facts .
H@@ 2@@ O becomes solid when the temperature is below zero degrees Celsius .
it turns into ga@@ z when the temperature is over 100 degrees Celsius .
the water we are talking about is a liquid .
why ?
is it a problem with the water itself ?
no , it is caused by the external factors .
I will give you another example , which is the wall .
the concept of wall exists among people who are in the business of interior design or home decoration .
however this concept is never a language for designers .
but a language among consumers , business people and the home decoration team .
we designers have no such a wall in our minds .
otherwise we can &apos;t make any meaningful innovation at all .
at best you can have Zhang Da@@ q@@ ian draw a m@@ ural wall , or an artist build a relief wall , a light @-@ steel ke@@ el wall or a breast wall .
but these are none of the business of a designer .
the reason why our design is unable to make any real breakthrough is that there is a wall in our designers &quot; minds .
what should we have in our minds ?
there isn &apos;t anything there .
a wall is never meant to be our purpose .
these are our ultimate goals .
you can see them clearly , so I won &apos;t read them one by one , just to save time .
to make these goals come true .
we can come up with many solutions , but not necessarily by building walls .
in 1986 , or 1987 , we once ran a design project for Hua@@ wei .
Ren Zheng@@ fei , the boss of Hua@@ wei , treated us a dinner .
he was ambitious for the future development of Hua@@ wei .
he told us that even a front@@ line worker in Hua@@ wei was a college graduate .
at least 90 % or 95 % of the post @-@ graduate students and doctoral students on communication technology studies in China were employed by Hua@@ wei .
all the available communication technologies in the world , be it that of the US , France , UK , Japan or Germany , had been imported by Hua@@ wei .
Hua@@ wei had everything , including money and R &amp; D teams , but he said he was confused about Hua@@ wei &apos;s future development .
was it necessary to further import foreign technologies ?
there wasn &apos;t any new technology available in the international market .
I said to him that , &quot; Mr. Ren , why should you continue importing new technologies from foreign countries ?
it isn &apos;t a big deal for you to pick a dozen of front@@ line workers that are college graduates since you already have all necessary technology . &quot;
&quot; you can find 3 more postgraduate students and one doctoral student as the team leader .
they can do some basic works that are so common among intellectuals . &quot;
who are in demand of design and telecommunication services ?
there are 3 to 5 types of people , when thinking harder .
you can have 10 to 20 types of people requiring telecommunication services .
what kinds of telecommunication services are in demand ?
you can further identify 10 to 20 types of telecommunication services .
then , you can think of the design constraints on the right hand corner .
there is a particular individual requiring a specific telecommunication service .
however , limited by external factors , this individual is unable to obtain the service accordingly .
that is the very purpose of developing new technologies .
after doing the per@@ mutation and combination .
you can tell that the imported technologies from the US and UK are not good enough to meet the demands .
I sent this picture to Mr. Ren on the second day after the meal .
and I believe that Hua@@ wei has accepted my theory .
why the Chinese can &apos;t do it ?
why do we have to follow foreigners &quot; path ?
the problem for Chinese lies right here .
this part is universal .
we are all human beings , right ?
these are the goals of various telecommunication services .
the limitations by external factors are the bottlen@@ ec@@ ks of our R &amp; D projects .
we therefore need to assign tasks to technologies , instead of following blindly after technologies .
this is exactly the language of design , or the logic of design .
unfortunately we don &apos;t have this kind of language nor logic .
back in 1999 , at the end of the last century .
Japan once held a high @-@ end Asia @-@ Pacific International Design Conference .
a director from Pan@@ as@@ onic Wash@@ ing Machine &apos;s Design Department gave an extravag@@ antly colorful description of the future technologies of Pan@@ as@@ onic washing machines in the 21st century .
after his speech .
the host deliberately asked me to talk about the made @-@ in @-@ China washing machines for the 21st century .
you know I was not a representative from M@@ idea or Hai@@ er .
so I said , &quot; China is going to abandon washing machines in the 21st century . &quot;
they were shocked and didn &apos;t know what was going on .
I said , &quot; I know that you are hygienic .
but have you figured out the utilization rate of washing machines in Japan yet ? &quot;
they told me that the utilization rate was less than 10 % .
I then said , &quot; For as little as 5 % to 7 % of utilization rate .
you Japanese people have invested heavily on these so called advanced technologies , and end up wasting and polluting a lot of fresh water resources .
we Chinese people won &apos;t do such a silly thing like this . &quot;
we need to solve problems .
this problem has nothing to do with the washing machine , but how can we keep our clo@@ ths clean .
however , most Chinese enterprises don &apos;t think of these .
instead most of their energies are spent on products development .
our current problem is not the product economy .
but a problem of industrial economy .
how can we launch a new industrial innovation ?
what is the status quo of our industries ?
this is the concept that I have been talking for so many years , we need to serve design .
serving is the very purpose , not having a car .
I bet most of you have a car of your own , have you figured out the utilization rate of cars ?
at least 60 % or 70 % of cars remain idle .
why do we need so many cars ?
we are in need of good transportation service .
we want to go places .
but we don &apos;t want cars at all .
if all 1.3 billion Chinese people all own a car of their own , pollution and traffic jams are inevitable .
we therefore need to think out of the box .
if we can &apos;t make a corner over@@ taking .
maybe we can make an over@@ taking at an alternative lane .
if we want a corner over@@ taking , foreigners &quot; cars might block you .
can &apos;t we see this picture clearly ?
you want to go .
but they will block you .
and that &apos;s why we need to find a new path .
people , espec@@ ial the design circle , nowadays keep talking about cultural elements .
I am not saying cultural elements aren &apos;t important .
but it is meaningless to design teap@@ ot and te@@ ac@@ up , the Yi@@ xing style .
if so , China will be doomed .
people lost in play will lose their aims .
by doing so , China will eventually become a country club for foreigners .
and we are doing exactly the same .
each village carries out a beautiful countryside campaign , selling hand@@ crafts and building hom@@ est@@ ay .
but what happen to Chinese agriculture ?
we need to think of our original intentions .
when speaking about culture , what is culture exactly ?
there are over 30 definitions within the ency@@ clo@@ pedia .
and you will find them very confusing .
in fact , it is OK if we don &apos;t understand one particular concept .
but we should never easily believe the words of others , even by masters .
you need to think how the concept is produced in the first place .
when one thing appears for the first time .
it is designed to solve a particular problem .
why does culture exist ?
why are you welcomed at a Mongolian y@@ urt in the grassland of Inner Mongolia ?
your classmate comes to meet you in Shanghai .
you two have a dinner together and say goodbye to each other .
why is that so ?
it is because culture is established by space and geographical conditions .
the transportation service was poor back then , right ?
there was few means of communication .
from Zhejiang to Fujian province , the local language differs whenever you over@@ pass a mountain .
when a particular culture is produced .
we then need to make a living in our given circumstances .
for thousands of years .
we are getting used to this mountain , this part of sky and soil .
and gradually we have created a culture unique to this land .
that is why we say that a culture is limited by space and geographical conditions .
we must be well aware of this fact , for over 10,000 years .
but there is another concept .
we need to consider the time dimension as well .
now we have a well connected transportation network and are able to communicate effectively with each other , right ?
but if you don &apos;t pay much attention to the time dimension .
you will be left abandoned by the history .
in what way can we reflect our own culture ?
cultural elements are best reflected in weddings and fun@@ er@@ als .
however , these are not the main part of our daily lives .
I don &apos;t think you will throw away computers and use the &quot; scholar &apos;s four jewels &quot; instead .
writing calligraphy on a piece of rice paper , and the paper even contains a drop of your mother &apos;s tear , can you ?
we need to be very clear about it .
the most representative example is Chinese calligraphy .
we use words to convey message , right ?
ancient people kept records by tying knots , which was the most primitive way of conveying message .
however it became harder to communicate because of the existence of class .
w@@ iz@@ ards were required to read the message contained om the tortoise shells .
they became the selected individuals who had the authorities to interpret the scripts .
otherwise they would not be called w@@ iz@@ ards at all .
then came the en@@ fe@@ off@@ ment , what is it ?
land plots were given to different feudal princes .
and the en@@ fe@@ off@@ ment scripts carved on the Ding , an ancient cooking vessel , became a symbol of power .
however , Ding was only given to feudal princes , not the general public .
emperor Qin Shi@@ huang later unified China , restoring the most crucial function of written text , which was to convey information .
he needed to control the Six Countries in his hands and made sure that his decrees were carried out smoothly without any mistake .
and that was why we Chinese had the a small seal calligraphy style , tablet of Wei Dynasty and regular script .
the cur@@ sive script was later replaced by the running hand in Chinese calligraphy .
and over time calligraphy became an art , and calligraphy lovers are in favor of Hui@@ x@@ u &apos;s style of cur@@ sive script .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know how to read this type of calligraphy .
you don &apos;t know either .
when calligraphy becomes an art only appreciated by a small number of people .
and people end up spending a considerable of time on it .
what do you think about the future of China ?
we later had the board printing , movable type , type printing and computer fon@@ ts and graphics .
as we came to realize that words were meant to convey information .
you can &apos;t throw away your computer and have the &quot; scholar &apos;s four jewels &quot; again , right ?
this is the fundamental principle .
but you can play with calligraphy leisurely during holidays .
does this part of history make you qui@@ ver ?
take a look at the TV series that have occupied most of the time of Chinese youths , Emperor K@@ ang@@ xi , Emperor Xu@@ an@@ z@@ ong of Tang , Princess Pearl , Leg@@ end of Mi@@ y@@ ue , Em@@ presses in the Palace , and other imperial @-@ ha@@ re@@ m competing play .
look at those developed countries .
where is the destination of their time travel ?
future .
they are not merely after entertainment .
but ponder the situations that will be encountered in the future and all sorts of possibilities .
think of the World Expo held in China , most of the scenes you saw were about present and past .
African counties only featured their past , with several naked black people dancing Hawai@@ ian dance and having oil paint on their bodies .
backward nations tend to get beaten up .
look at the World Ex@@ po@@ s held in any developed country .
it is all about the exploring the possibilities of future .
what shall we do ? we need to revitalize .
it is a burning question raised by the time .
President Xi speaks about the dream of the rejuven@@ ation of the Chinese nation .
but the dream is not about making a fortune by over 1.3 billion Chinese people .
there is an advertisement of Yan@@ ghe Da@@ qu that appears right before the CCTV News each day .
the advertisement is about the shared dream of millions of people . to me , it is a dream of making a fortune .
we are talking about the dream of the rejuven@@ ation of the Chinese nation .
but not the one of making a fortune .
we are standing on the shoulders of giants .
but we need to look down at our feet .
we need to change our conventional viewpoint as well .
which path shall China &apos;s design follow ?
the path is never the so called art and crafts movement by wester@@ ners , or the artistic design path .
the path we should follow is very specific .
it is the grand design with a clear vision and problems that need to be addressed .
as long as these things are useful to us .
we don &apos;t need to own them .
China is a country with a population of 1.3 billion people , and we are troubled by im@@ balanced regional development .
that is why we have to follow such a development path .
if we spend our energy on the studies of fashion , then China is doomed .
all the resources would have been taken by GU@@ CC@@ I and other famous brands .
and we will be left with nothing .
that &apos;s why we should have a different path instead .
what shall we do when we are exposed to such a competition environment ?
we should never repeat the same mistakes of our ancestors .
it was Chinese people who invented gun@@ powder .
we used gun@@ powder to make fireworks and firecr@@ ackers .
but foreigners used the same gun@@ powder to make weapons that attacked us .
haven &apos;t we had not enough lessons ?
design is never meant to be a business .
people in the design circle now keep talking about business .
as if design without business is never design at all .
if that so , why don &apos;t you be a businessman yourself and quit design ?
this is a strategy .
our ancestors told us that we should &quot; cope with shifting events by sticking to a fundamental principle . &quot;
it is so true and it is not outdated at all .
our ancestors created the unique culture , and philosophy here is simple .
what we want is food , clothing , shelter and communication , and these are essential in our daily lives .
as for sed@@ an , car and rocket , these are carriers that are subject to constant changes .
our ancestors knew that , and what was their suggestion ?
we need to create .
think about it .
shall we continue our tradition through inheritance ?
no .
Eng@@ els said inheritance should take place in a critical manner .
and traditions were created by our ancestors one generation after another .
traditions existed during the Spring and Autumn Period , right ?
we Chinese had our traditions in Qin and Han dynasty , as well as Tang and Song dynasty .
do you think that our traditions only refers to those things that were kept in the For@@ bidden City by Em@@ press Dow@@ ager Ci@@ xi ?
traditions are created .
I keep saying these words .
yesterday was considered as the tradition for today , while today is considered as the tradition for tomorrow .
we must create today .
we should never pass on the past traditions alone , inheritance might sound left @-@ wing or revolutionary .
but we should never forget our responsibilities .
we Chinese people say it is our philosophy , the traditional competition and wisdom .
however , it is a totally different thing .
our kind of &quot; W@@ id@@ som &quot; are the clever@@ ness in trivial matters , or petty shrew@@ dness .
we Chinese people are experts in this regard without any guidance .
what we lack is the true wisdom , what is wisdom ?
wisdom means that you should not take advantage of loop@@ holes , or refuse the clever@@ ness in trivial matters .
what we lack is this kind of wisdom .
only by doing so , can we achieve great success in the reform and opening up .
in our transformation and upgrade , provision of a Chinese solution for a community of shared future for mankind .
as what President Xi has said , we will never seek hegemony , right ?
we are considering not only the interests of China , but also the fate of global development .
this is the grand obligation of China , a responsible world power .
I believe that with this concept China will become better and better .
thank you .
hi , everyone .
I am Liu We@@ ili , founder of Lin@@ qu app .
it is a great honor for me to stand here today .
this speech is about last mile delivery , Starbucks to your door . how does it work ?
Starbucks may be a familiar name to the majority of us .
most of us may have bought one .
some of us buy it in a store .
some order it via new online platforms .
what is the experience of buying in a store or ordering from a platform like ?
here is a picture .
take a look and see if it matches your everyday experience .
you are probably wondering what this gorgeous beauty is doing ?
in fact , she is delivering Starbucks for our users .
you may doubt whether the picture was phot@@ os@@ hoped or the woman in the picture is a PR officer rather than a deli@@ ve@@ rer .
I can assure you that the picture is not phot@@ os@@ hoped and the lady in the picture is not a PR .
she is truly one of our deli@@ vere@@ rs .
what is the story behind this picture ?
the beauty is actually one of our fans , one of our users .
she ordered several times via our app and came to notice that some deli@@ vere@@ rs are young and handsome , some are young and smart , and others are cultivated .
she wondered why .
therefore , she contacted us and learnt that what we are doing is called crow@@ d@@ sourced delivery .
she immediately asked to join us .
therefore , she became one of our freelance deli@@ vere@@ rs and started to deliver Starbucks for our app users .
you might argue this example is too exceptional .
rarely do we see such a beautiful deli@@ ve@@ rer .
this is how an average deli@@ ve@@ rer looks like .
here is another picture . this may be what a deliver@@ yman typically looks like in our minds .
what can we learn from the two pictures ?
what does these two pictures reveal ?
there is a lot more to it than meets the eye .
what these two pictures mark is a real revolution in the labor market .
why do I use such a term , calling it as a revolution ?
because , over the past few thousand years , no fundamental change has ever taken place in our labor market .
thousands of years ago , all labor force were affiliated to an organization , such as a farm , a slave owner , or an imperial body@@ guard .
this affiliation was compulsory .
no employee has ever had the opportunity to make his own choice .
he was either born to serve someone or confined to a place due to his family background , nationality or birthplace .
in China , we have a term called &quot; dan@@ wei , &quot; distingu@@ ishable from company .
what does &quot; dan@@ wei &quot; mean ?
it means to put every employee in a small cu@@ bic@@ le .
this cu@@ bic@@ le is called dan@@ wei .
through this way of organization , we are forced to depend on our employer rather than stay independent .
therefore , this kind of affiliation has been solidi@@ fied for thousands of years .
however , we are very pleased to see that in the past ten years .
with the development of Internet and sharing economy , such an affiliation has been shaken and our labor force have gained more freedom of choice .
so I think this is not an evolution , it is a true revolution .
what &apos;s more , we can see that the traditional employment relationship has been changed .
if you are an employer , you might have experienced this bitterness .
suppose you hire someone and pays him for his work , but you still have to worry whether he is doing his work properly .
you get so worried that you could not sleep well or even get anxious .
this is because in such an employment relationship our employees are not proactive enough .
they work for us as long as we pay them .
they work as hard as they are paid .
such a simple employment relationship has remained the same for the past thousands of years .
in ancient or modern times , in a traditional farm or a modern company , the employment relationship remains the same .
however , over the ten years , this kind of employment relationship has actually undergone revolutionary changes .
employees and employers are slowly becoming partners .
of course , we still need to pay our partners .
after all , there is no free meal .
however , different from the past , the vision and interests of both parties are now in common .
this transformation of the traditional employment relationship to a cooperative relationship is part of the changes brought by the new economy modes .
in addition , we have also noticed that we have more trust among each other than before .
in the past , employers and employees did not have a strong trust bond .
management was about administering and monitoring the employees .
what was the role of monitoring ?
the process itself was meaningless .
it served to guarantee that the company would make money and operate well .
today , in an era of new economy and sharing economy , employees , platforms , users and managers actually share a strong trust bond .
with such a trust bond , co@@ or@@ por@@ ate operation will be more efficient and the management costs much lower .
therefore , these two pictures are more than two distinctive images of delivery people .
they are a sign of the fundamental changes in the labor market and labor force revolution .
this may sound too theoretical .
therefore , I am going to talk about it in a more detailed way .
I will take our company as an example to illustrate how the labor market has changed and where it is heading .
what do our company do ?
we run an intra @-@ city err@@ ands @-@ running service platform , which provides multiple services for our users .
to provide diversified service , we need to cover a broad geographical reach and a wide range of service types .
this can be very labor @-@ intensive .
it also means we have to offer various kinds of services and handle divergent customer needs .
for example , some middle class are too busy to go and buy a coffee himself .
it can also be very exhausting to walk several hundred meters or even one kilometers for a coffee .
what is the solution ?
they can turn to a sharing economy platform such as Lin@@ qu to help them buy the coffee when they are busy .
in addition to being busy , there are a large number of young people , who are commonly labeled as &quot; lazy . &quot;
hear me out before you get angry .
here , &quot; lazy &quot; is not a pe@@ j@@ or@@ ative word .
rather , it is related to the sang culture and z@@ hai culture .
what do the younger generations prefer to do ?
they prefer to spend more time on online games , anim@@ e , or in soci@@ alizing with friends .
another situation is when it is pouring or the sun is scor@@ ching , but they have to run some err@@ ands .
they do not feel like to run the err@@ ands , but these household chores have to be done .
suppose we shut ourselves at home , but the electricity bill is overdue , what should we do ?
our platform can help you with these err@@ ands .
besides being busy or lazy , what should we do in cases of emergency ?
what should we do if we need to have something repaired ?
going out to get it repaired is both time @-@ consuming and inconvenient .
I might have a paper deadline to catch .
in this case , we can find someone else to run the err@@ ands for us .
well , this a brief introduction to our platform , not a promotion .
therefore , our platform targets three mainstream user needs .
to meet these needs , we need many people who are distributed in every corner of the country and are on standby for rapid deployment .
under the traditional employment relations , with the traditional way of organization , dozens of or even hundreds thousands of employees would not be enough .
then what should I do ?
we opt for a new way of workforce organization .
it allows us to do our job without hiring a daun@@ tingly large crowd of people .
it is called outsourcing .
that is to say , we will not assign a task to a specific person .
anyone who works for our platform and is capable of doing the task can be appointed to do it .
I called this strategy &quot; unite with all the forces that can be united . &quot;
whether you are a deliver@@ yman , a normal white @-@ collar , a security guard , or a waiter in a bar .
crow@@ d@@ sourcing and sharing economy platforms can help you make the best of your time and boost your income .
why not have a try ?
therefore , crow@@ d@@ sourcing helps to unite all the labor forces available .
is this end of the story ?
it seems crow@@ d@@ sourcing has solved all the problems .
however , in practice and our experience over the past three years , we come gradually to see that crow@@ d@@ sourcing cannot solve all the problems .
when a typhoon lands or it is extremely cold or hot in Shanghai , our out@@ sourced personnel will prioritize their own interests .
that is to say , when it is hot outside , they will stay indoors and refuse to deliver service .
in this case , what do we meet the user needs ?
it will not go back to the tradition labor relationship by hiring a large number of employees .
the in @-@ house and out@@ sourced personnel would have to compete with each other and result in conflicting interests .
therefore , we introduced another kind of employment relation , contracting .
that is to say , we pick out certain areas , for example Lu@@ ji@@ az@@ ui , and contract it to a reliable person to maintain the service quality and user experience .
suppose this person is also good at management .
he recruits another two fellow town@@ smen or colleagues and form a small team .
their business thri@@ ves .
the better their business , the more he will earn .
this is called contracting .
in this way , it is guaranteed that our personnel will standby for quick deployment and be motivated to deliver service even in a rainy day .
to contract certain areas , we have to pay a certain amount of contracting fees to the platform , so in turn we will naturally be motivated to deliver more service to earn the money back .
this is human instinct .
this is our two ways of organization , crow@@ d@@ sourcing and contracting .
however , this is not enough yet .
suppose we are already doing a good job in Shanghai and have many platform users , so I want to expand our business to the whole country .
what should we do ?
if we do it in a traditional way , we will have to hire a full @-@ time team probably a work force as large as Ali &apos;s , exceeding 50,000 people .
we could not afford such a high management cost , so we found another way , partnership .
a good partner must have vision .
there is a saying , &quot; keep our dream alive , because it might come true someday . &quot;
this saying inspired so many people to start their own business .
starting a business does not necessarily mean going to venture capital , signing an agreement , securing a sum of investment , setting up a new company , and raising investments round after round like what we did .
this is only one of the paths towards success .
it is not the only path .
there are many micro @-@ small entrepreneurs who have local resources but no technical capacities .
they also have dreams to pursue .
therefore , we collaborate with these micro @-@ small entrepreneurs and share with them our brand , our experiences and systems .
in this way , they could build a delivery service network bits by bits in this new city .
therefore , altogether we adopted three systems of organization , crow@@ d@@ sourcing , contracting and partnership , to meet various needs .
in this way , we made is possible to provide timely services to our users without hiring a large workforce .
you might be wondering how we manage the security risks brought by out@@ sourced work force .
security is our top priority .
China and the United States have different security certification practices .
us has a more developed and connected credit system .
we can easily obtain a check an employee &apos;s social security record , insurance record , credit record online and criminal record online .
this traditional way of society organization helps us to check the background of an employee .
however , it is not practical yet here , but over the past ten years , our online security system has actually surpassed that of US and the world average .
as the online and offline credibility system improves , we can expect to guarantee a basic level of security .
we now have S@@ es@@ ame Credit and will soon have We@@ Chat credit , so we believe there will be no great security risks in this wider environment .
however , beyond this , we have made other efforts .
our platform follows very strict criteria in recruiting crow@@ d@@ sourcing , contracting , and partnership employees .
we verify his identity , record his information , evaluate his competence , provide training for them , and get him assessed after the training .
if he fails to pass the exam , he will have to re@@ take the training .
after passing the exam , he can become a member of us and work in one of the crow@@ d@@ sourcing , contracting and partnership systems .
in addition to high admission criteria , we have also made many efforts in supervising .
our system is equipped with automated technology that tracks the location of the personnel and monitors the key procedures .
after the order is completed , we also consider the user &apos;s rating and evaluation .
only users really know the quality of the service .
users can give feedback anony@@ m@@ ously without their privacy protected .
in this way , we obtain an objective , or partly objective , partly subjective feedback for the service .
this rating influences how many orders a delivery people gets from the platform .
if his rating is too low , our platform will stop assigning orders to him .
through these three strategies , we can prevent most major security risks .
in addition to security concerns , I would also like to talk about pricing .
how to price such a wide range of services ?
pricing has always been a tricky problem .
if the price is too high , no customer will pay for our service .
if the price is too low , our employee will be discouraged and quit .
what we did was to standardize the price of various personalized needs .
the first way of pricing is by space , or by distance .
if the delivery distance is long , the price will accordingly be higher .
if the delivery distance is short , the price will be lower .
this is a simple way of pricing .
but we standardized all the prices so that our users can enjoy a smart shopping experience and our employees can have trust in the accuracy of the pricing system and feel assured that their work will be properly rewarded .
besides space , we also provide a large number of time @-@ related services .
um , I believe most of you have an experience of buying HE@@ Y@@ T@@ EA and most of you are not willing to wait in a line for three to five hours for a drink .
in this case , one of our deliver@@ yman can wait in the line and buy the drink for you .
this is a typical example of time @-@ based pricing .
customers pay 30 yuan for one hour of waiting or 60 yuan for two hours of waiting .
this is how the pricing is done .
we also have some other customer needs .
for example , if a customer needs a fourth player to play ma@@ h@@ j@@ ong .
how do we price such a service ?
we have to meet this kind of customer needs .
in this case , the market decides the price to achieve a balance between supply and demand .
suppose a customer offers 30 yuan to hire another ma@@ h@@ j@@ ong player , but no one responds , so he raises his offer to 35 yuan and one of our personnel responds .
in this way , they will be able to find a fourth player .
this is how market places a price on the service .
together with the standardized time @-@ based and space @-@ based pr@@ cing mechanisms , it formed a com@@ ar@@ atively complete pricing system .
we have talked about the present .
then , how will sharing economy change the society in future ?
what will the future look like ?
I read in The Story of T@@ enc@@ ent that yesterday is meaningless once it is over because we all keep our eyes on the future .
I cannot agree with it anymore .
we are all looking at the future .
we all believe that the future will be better .
some people are so keen to expressing their views on AI .
they say that AI will destroy human beings and replace human as workforce .
I do not agree .
I am optimistic towards it .
compared to the past , any small or medium @-@ sized baths in Shanghai will beat the baths for Roman emper@@ ors thousands of years ago .
a cheapest pillow from Ta@@ obao will be more user @-@ friendly than the one used by the Em@@ press Dow@@ ager in the For@@ bidden City .
therefore , the material life conditions and economic well @-@ being of the society will definitely turn better and better .
therefore , to each employee , to each of us , the sharing economy will bring more options .
whether you are a low @-@ end worker that sells your own time , or a high @-@ end one that sells your skills , or one who sells your contacts or resources , you will enjoy more choices .
you can choose to share every aspect of your life , clothing , food , accommodation or transport .
your time can be shared . your skills can also be shared .
this way we will have more freedom of choice and live our ideal life .
on the other hand , as employees , we all want to stay independent rather than being hurried to work by the employer .
in the future when the sharing economy is highly developed , each of us will make a living out of our expertise and save more time for our hobbies .
if like most teenagers born after the 199@@ 5@@ s or 200@@ 0s , I love watching anim@@ e , what should I do ?
what is my specialty ?
if I am great at playing online games and win for most of the time , I can choose freely to make a living out of this skill and exchange for more freedom to watch anim@@ e .
future will bring with it improved material life conditions as well as more freedom of choice . we can choose to do what we are passionate about in an independent way .
of course , what we ultimately pursue in life is happiness .
under the tide of sharing economy , we can enjoy all kinds of things shared by others .
besides , sharing itself is also a pleasure .
in most time , we see what we believe in , not the other way around .
I believe in a better future , therefore I see it .
thank you !
good afternoon everyone !
with the Internet technologies being highly developed .
today we can send conveniently a joke , a picture or a video through We@@ Chat to a family member or a friend .
10 GB of data could even be sent out within only one minute .
but there are also some things not so easy to be sent .
say , transferring ten US dollars to your friend in the US might prove very challenging for you .
that &apos;s because assets like US dollars are ir@@ repro@@ du@@ cible and their peer @-@ to @-@ peer transmission must be credit @-@ based .
so how do we make credit work in our real life ?
most of the times we depend on intermediaries such as the government and banks .
all those intermediaries constitute the basis of the social credit system .
generally they are very good at their work .
and that earns them the title &quot; omni@@ potent intermediaries . &quot;
but problems still exist .
for example , cross @-@ border remittance , as I just mentioned .
is always known for its low efficiency and high cost .
another example is , suppose one day you buy a house and the next day you may wake up being si@@ eg@@ ed by crowds ze@@ al@@ ously ready to offer you help in re@@ decorating it .
obviously your private information has been leaked .
so those intermediaries can also turn out to be very unreliable .
is there a possibility that we could use some technology to optimize and even reconstruct the basis of the social credit system ?
in 2008 , a h@@ acker named Sat@@ os@@ hi N@@ ak@@ am@@ oto released a peer @-@ to @-@ peer electronic cash system .
this system , after being launched on line , was cheered by h@@ acker groups and all kinds of gray organizations such as those that run gambling and money laundering business .
&quot; B@@ it@@ coin System , &quot; that &apos;s its name .
the value of bit@@ coins has surged by a million times in the past eight years .
that may suggest a high possibility of speculation .
but it &apos;s hard to deny that bit@@ coins indeed have some essential value .
let &apos;s look closely and see how the bit@@ coin transactions are different from traditional money transfer services conducted by banks .
the left side of the screen shows us how the banks perform money transfers , which we are very familiar with .
banks work as a reliable intermediary to make credit work at its best .
the entire process , in which banks , like a book@@ keeper .
deduct some money from the account A and add the money to the account B , is quite simple .
the right side of the screen displays how the bit@@ coin transfers work .
it &apos;s more complicated , and I &apos;ll explain it a little bit .
when A is transferring bit@@ coins to B .
information of this transaction will be sent to all the nodes of the bit@@ coin network through the P@@ 2@@ P technology .
then all the nodes will use a consensus algorithm to check the validity of the transaction .
the result of each node &apos;s check will then be sent through the P@@ 2@@ P technology to all the other nodes .
the nodes will jointly analyze the results of the check , authentic@@ ate and record the transaction .
the entire process depends on algorithms to achieve a consensus and thus builds its own credit system .
it works like an online ledger .
involving all the nodes of the network at the same time .
and what &apos;s most important .
you may find that intermediaries are no longer needed here .
that &apos;s also why financial institutions in recent two years are s@@ warming to study this technology that might be a game chang@@ er in future .
this technology is the block@@ chain .
it is in general composed of five technologies .
P@@ 2@@ P technologies , consensus algorithms , block@@ chain construction , smart contracts and crypto@@ graphy .
those five technologies are not newly invented and they have actually existed for many years .
but combined together , they burst into a magical chemical reaction and create a new @-@ type credit system .
it &apos;s just like ten years ago , when Steve Jobs compounded the cell phone , the iPod and the browser technology , iPhone came out .
as a provider of the third @-@ party payment system for years .
we have combined our decades of expertise with the block@@ chain ide@@ ologies and the peculi@@ arities of many businesses we &apos;ve met in practice , and independently invented a new block@@ chain system .
which is based on database and named Tru@@ st@@ SQL .
as we see it , block@@ chain should be considered as a very basic technology for connection .
as a reliable technology , it could be used to tackle the problems with the intermediaries I mentioned earlier .
based on it , very specific , practical measures and applications can be proposed and implemented .
they could then be optimized and even be used to enhance mutual trust between institutions or businesses .
in this way , the collaboration between different organizations will be more trustworthy , more efficient and less expensive .
and thus the largest possible value might be created .
so how exactly does the technology work ?
many people will associate the block@@ chain with the bit@@ coin , and some even define the block@@ ch@@ ine as a tool in finance .
but let &apos;s try something different today .
suppose someone in your family goes missing .
can you think of a faster way to find him or her ?
we all hear of some philanthrop@@ ic organizations who can help look for the missing people .
but because they usually ask for registration and authentication , controversi@@ es rage over the security of the registration information , the ownership of the data and the protection of privacy .
which leads to a wavering mutual trust between all those organizations .
in that manner , each organization is actually made into a highly isolated island of information .
what &apos;s the problem with that ?
I &apos;ll give you an example .
if a child gets lost .
it usually requires an interval of several hours between in@@ putting information at the first node and then doing that at the second node .
during the interval .
perhaps the missing child may happen to come within the reach of the loud@@ speaker of the second node .
or this child might have already been found and taken home for dinner .
but those organizations who are looking for the child don &apos;t know this .
they keep searching and thus cause a huge waste of resources .
this year in April .
together with &quot; Bao@@ bei@@ hu@@ i@@ jia &quot; and the &quot; 4@@ 04 Not @-@ F@@ ound project . &quot;
we used our Tru@@ st@@ SQL sharing @-@ ledger solution and constructed a philanthrop@@ ic finding @-@ the @-@ missing @-@ people chain .
any information input at one node could be shared throughout the entire chain .
thus problems like the &quot; isolated islands &quot; could be avoided .
and the work of looking for missing people could be more efficient and transparent .
take something that happened around me .
half a month ago .
a high @-@ school classmate of mine .
terribly uneasy , came to me and told me his father , who was very old , went lost .
I remember it was the afternoon of August 14th .
we immediately got him registered and authentic@@ ated that very night .
and the next day , at noon .
good news came through his happy tone .
his father was back - even much faster than he had imagined .
neither had we thought he could be found within such a short period .
later when we were investigating the whole thing .
we found that it was the &quot; Mom@@ ents &quot; of We@@ Chat that circulated the information of the missing old man that helped us find him .
that &apos;s to say , when we were registering on &quot; Bao@@ bei@@ hu@@ i@@ jia &quot; website that night .
the node at We@@ Chat immediately captured the information about my classmate &apos;s missing father , sent it out and spread it by means of its &quot; Mom@@ ents . &quot;
luckily , the old man was recognized by someone who had seen the information .
that &apos;s why we could find him so quickly .
small as the case might sound , the charm of the block@@ chain was profoundly felt and revealed here .
it can make our society more hear@@ tw@@ arming .
that is a small case .
now let &apos;s see something bigger .
once a notorious question was posed , which went , &quot; How can you prove that the woman you call &quot; mom &quot; is your real mother ? &quot;
it caused a huge uproar .
when we were developing our block@@ chain technology , a thought constantly occurred to us that actually in our whole life , from our birth to our old age .
we are also always urged to prove our identity - our existence , growth and capabilities .
why am I saying that ?
because we are applying for certificates all the time , such as the student ID cards , birth certificates and property ownership certificates .
those certificates cost us huge amounts of time and money , and bring us many troubles .
if the authentication applications of the block@@ chain could be used , then we would be able to combine all those information behind the certificates in a digital identity chain , and get an all @-@ purpose certificate once and for all .
perhaps we &apos;ll just need to register our fingerprints and then be authentic@@ ated to exploit related data to prove our own identity .
in that sense , I guess the &quot; proving the identity of your mother &quot; con@@ un@@ drum might finally vanish .
in that sense , I guess the &quot; proving the identity of your mother &quot; con@@ un@@ drum might finally vanish .
earlier this year there was a very popular TV drama named &quot; In the Name of People . &quot;
it began with an official sur@@ named Zhao being caught grafting 100 million RMB .
when I was watching this .
I couldn &apos;t help thinking that .
if in future all the assets like cash could be digi@@ tized and placed in the block@@ chain .
whose data are un@@ alter@@ able but tr@@ ack@@ able , then perhaps the anti @-@ corruption con@@ un@@ drum haun@@ ting Chinese history for thousands of years would finally be effectively solved .
to sum up , we have used several cases today to focus on three benefits the block@@ chain will bring to us .
and we will find that the block@@ chain is offering another possibility to our world in future .
that is well demonstrated by the fact that the block chain can optimize the basis of our social credit system .
we used to build houses with wood and stones .
but now we have shifted to steel and concrete .
the block@@ chain is just like steel and concrete in the online world .
it will build a more harmonious and solid bond between people , organizations and even countries , thereby making their cooperation more efficient and transparent , and helping them create more value for the society .
as long as we can break through our mental barriers , dare to try , and harbor integrity and love in our heart .
we &apos;ll be able to make the block@@ chain shine like a bright star .
thank you .
hello , everyone .
I &apos;m a veteran solid@@ er in the catering business .
I have over 40 years &quot; experience in the catering and retail business .
to me innovation is logic .
innovation basically is a form of logic , not a method nor a technology .
if the innovation , as a form of logic , is right , it can surely stand the test of the time .
similarly , today &apos;s design thinking is not purely related to art .
we treat design as a form of art , but design itself isn &apos;t purely scientific .
more importantly , it is a way of thinking .
design thinking will make sure that an im@@ pec@@ cable logic won &apos;t go wrong , or enable logic to further improve itself .
there is an old classic movie .
we can &apos;t call it a sc@@ i @-@ fi movie anymore , as it contains little science fiction elements from the current point of view .
the movie &apos;s name is Back to the Future .
this classic Hollywood movie , with Michael Fo@@ ster as the main character , even had several sequ@@ els .
the main character of the movie accid@@ ently discovered a time machine that allowed him to travel back and forth of different times , and he spent a considerable of time traveling between the past and the future .
but what for ?
if he had done anything wrong , he could have travelled back to the past time and got it fixed .
what &apos;s the point in travelling to the future ?
I &apos;m not sure whether I have done things right today .
maybe I can travel to the future , see the implication of my action today and get it fixed .
that will be great , if there were really such a time machine .
but to me the movie has a very strange name , which is called Back to the Future .
when we say you are back to somewhere , are we supposed to say &quot; back to the past &quot; ?
as for travelling on a time machine , we have made it a reality today .
it reminds me of the words said by Jack Ma .
it is an interesting and very famous quote .
he said , &quot; Today is cruel , tomorrow will be worse , but the day after tomorrow will be beautiful ; however , most people will die before tomorrow evening . &quot;
after hearing Jack Ma &apos;s words , we business operators naturally will feel pessimistic about the future .
I once worked in McDonald &apos;s for many years .
McDonald &apos;s was first established in 1950 .
this year was considered the Golden E@@ ra for the fast food business .
many of us have heard about the story of McDonald &apos;s .
McDonald brothers sold their business to an ambitious man whose name was Ray K@@ ro@@ c .
McDonald brothers indeed had created a different development pattern .
based on the existing business model , Ray K@@ ro@@ c decided to further institution@@ alize , simplify and standardize his business .
he hoped that , by minimizing costs , McDonald &apos;s would win the favor of the majority of people .
it is a very simple logic , nothing complicated at all .
till today the product mix of all McDonald &apos;s outlets in the entire world is almost the same .
they continue selling those universal food items , except that some outlets will introduce new foods occasionally .
McDonald &apos;s ends up having 3@@ 8,000 outlets across the globe , nearly 40,000 outlets , in the past 60 years .
what can we learn from McDonald &apos;s story ?
what can we see ?
what is necessary to sustain an enterprise &apos;s innovation ?
I will continue talking about the catering sector .
when Ray K@@ ro@@ c first set up his business , or took over the business from the McDonald brothers , he immediately realized that something important must be done .
and the things were the three sentences I mentioned earlier , which was how to institution@@ alize , simplify and standardize his business .
when these things had been done , he trained a large number of employees to meet the rising market demand .
there were an increasing number of baby bo@@ omers and professional women .
you know , that was a time during the Second World War , when men were sent to war and professional women , young people and children were left home .
it was a rare development opportunity for all fast @-@ food restaurants .
ray K@@ ro@@ c was absorbed in doing these things .
he wanted to minimize his cost and sell his products at the lowest possible price , so that the majority of people could afford McDonald &apos;s .
K@@ FC is the first foreign fast food brand to enter Chinese market .
and McDonald &apos;s only entered China in 1989 .
the opening of K@@ FC &apos;s first shop in China marked a new era of catering sector of China .
what are the changes of catering sector in the past 30 years ?
in the 1987 the total output value of the entire catering sector in China was about 10 billion yuan .
however , this figure is expected to reach 3.8 trillion yuan by the end of this year .
what a transforming change it is .
however , our peers in the catering sector still keep complaining about the difficulties like higher labor cost and higher rent .
everything becomes expensive , but they cannot charge more .
it is natural that everyone wants to build a high @-@ end brand , right ?
but when we look back at K@@ FC or McDonald &apos;s at a time when they made their fortune in the US .
we will realize their basic principle , which was to institution@@ alize , simplify and standardize their business model , minimize cost and make their products affordable to the majority of people .
this simple logic has never been changed at all .
of course we are now exposed to the impact caused by the Internet , and it might not be easy to get things done nowadays .
but in principle , I don &apos;t think we have applied the same logic yet .
I assume that when the CEO of K@@ FC , or McDonald &apos;s , in the year 20@@ 50 were transported back to a time in 1950 , it is very likely that they will do exactly the same as Ray K@@ ro@@ c did .
because that is the right thing to do , and the logic is fine , right ?
how have these changes happened ?
how will you maintain your status in the long course of time ?
we therefore need to find the Third Wis@@ dom among these ideas .
when you are asked which is the world &apos;s best @-@ performing ophthal@@ mic care hospital , in terms of scale , growth potential and popularity 。
will you name a hospital in India ?
I will tell you that it is a hospital in India , and you might feel it hard to believe .
it is a hospital called Ar@@ av@@ ind Eye Care System , which is founded by Dr. G. Ven@@ k@@ at@@ as@@ w@@ amy .
at the age of 57 , just like Ray K@@ ro@@ c still selling drink mixer at the age of 54 , Dr. G. Ven@@ k@@ at@@ as@@ w@@ amy developed a sense of helpl@@ essness when running his small eye clinic .
patients with financial difficulty can even receive free treatment at his clinic .
however , despite that Dr. G. Ven@@ k@@ at@@ as@@ w@@ amy was willing to offer assistance to more patients , his clinic was far too tiny , with only 11 medical beds .
he started to think , &quot; I &apos;m near retirement , what &apos;s the true meaning of my life ? I want to help those patients , but I can &apos;t . what shall I do ? &quot;
Dr. G. Ven@@ k@@ at@@ as@@ w@@ amy suddenly thought of McDonald &apos;s , as McDonald &apos;s was a rising star in the 1950s .
he had read news reports about the success of McDonald &apos;s in 1976 .
therefore , he registered a course at the Ham@@ burger University , saying that &quot; I want to learn how McDonald &apos;s runs its business in an efficient way . &quot;
what about the outcome of his learning trip ?
his business grew from an 11 @-@ bed clinic to a large @-@ scale hospital network .
by 2015 he had cured 23 million patients , including 4 million cases involving corneal transplantation surgery .
you know , back in the 1976 , corneal transplantation was still considered as an advanced technology .
what Dr. G. Ven@@ k@@ at@@ as@@ w@@ amy had done to improve the situation ?
after learning the best practices from McDonald &apos;s , he decided to institution@@ alize , simplify and standardize his medical service .
so in the past a doctor could only perform 5 sur@@ ger@@ ies in average each day .
but now the same doctor can perform 80 to 100 sur@@ ger@@ ies each day , why ?
Dr. G. Ven@@ k@@ at@@ as@@ w@@ amy used a large number of volunteers from poverty @-@ stricken families .
when there was anyone within a family suffering from blindness , the family would be ruined .
you know , a blind person could never work to support his family .
Dr. G. Ven@@ k@@ at@@ as@@ w@@ amy recruited a large number of volunteers from poverty @-@ stricken families , including those patients with corne@@ a disease or cataract conditions , and provided essential medical training to them .
the entire medical service was simplified , and a doctor was only required to do the simplest .
all doctors are kind people , and they all hope to help more patients in need .
so with the assistance by these well @-@ trained volunteers , doctors are able to perform the surgery in a short period of time , by using the scal@@ pel , and therefore end up saving more patients .
the hospital can handle many more surgical cases , which greatly reduces its operational cost .
do you know to what extent the hospital has reduced its cost ?
a patient who is required to have an eye corneal transplantation only needs to pay one thous@@ and@@ th of the original medical cost .
Dr. G. Ven@@ k@@ at@@ as@@ w@@ amy even part@@ nered with a large factory in producing the finest but cheapest intra@@ ocular lens , cutting the cost from the original 200 yuan to 15 yuan .
indeed , a medical professional from a high @-@ tech industry ends up learning useful experience from McDonald &apos;s .
there is one thing that still surprises us today .
you know India has a large number of poverty population , and two thirds of Dr. G. Ven@@ k@@ at@@ as@@ w@@ amy &apos;s patients don &apos;t pay any medical fee at all .
however , with the medical fees paid by one third of the patients , the hospital survi@@ ves and is considered as the most profitable and the best @-@ performing hospital in the world .
the logic won &apos;t go wrong if you can cut cost , streamline procedure , train your workforce and make dupl@@ ications fast .
regardless of time , by following this logic , you can make a breakthrough eventually .
I once visited a factory in Suzhou , which was a manufacturer of intelligent robot arms .
the robot arms are able to perform the cataract surgery and eye corneal transplantation surgery .
with what ?
with the intelligent robot arms .
what was my first reaction after learning the news ?
would it beat Ar@@ av@@ ind Eye Care System ?
I later thought that it would never happen .
the robot arms would only help doctors there to perform 1,000 sur@@ ger@@ ies each day .
I even think of the possibility for the hospital as an independent entity in winning the Nobel Peace Prize by the end of this century , why ?
because the hospital has erad@@ icated catar@@ acts @-@ induced blindness in India .
this logic won &apos;t go wrong at all , despite that we have more advanced technologies and more sophisticated designs today .
to me , this kind of basic innovation logic is never wrong .
enterprises that don &apos;t make a breakthrough will die , and there is one thing in common among those surviving enterprises , which is the readiness to embrace innovation .
what is the true meaning of the readiness to embrace innovation ?
guided by this innovation thinking or innovation logic , you need to carry out reform and make changes .
you need to figure out where are you heading to and your ultimate goals .
a Michel@@ in restaurant and a fast food restaurant are two different destinations .
I must find the most convincing reason to make a smart decision and do something I &apos;m good at .
this is exactly the thing that you need to stick to on the course of innovation , which will help you travel a much longer distance .
the innovation is like a river , such as the Yangtze River and the Yellow River .
you can &apos;t stop it at all .
that &apos;s why you need to have both the key principle and effective solutions at the same time .
we might have some little tricks .
we only make some minor changes .
would that be of help to us ?
there is a perfect example .
when I first worked at Mc@@ don@@ ald &apos;s , the restaurant name was close to the Cantonese pronunciation , which sounded like a Ma@@ id@@ ang slave .
think about it .
when the name Ma@@ id@@ ang slave appears today , it is not proper at all , isn &apos;t it ?
we felt odd as well when we saw the name in China Town , and then decided to voice our concern to our headquarters office , &quot; Can we design a new set of logo ? &quot;
McDonald &apos;s grew its business in the US in a down @-@ to @-@ earth manner , and we wanted to grow our business in China the same way .
we ended up making some changes to the Chinese name .
so when you visit a Mc@@ don@@ ald &apos;s outlet , you will see they are selling M@@ ai@@ xiang Fish and M@@ ai@@ xiang Chicken .
these are traditional Chinese names , nothing to do with the translation , and nothing to do with the Fil@@ et @-@ O @-@ Fish .
you are mostly likely to be greeted by &quot; welcome &quot; whenever you walk into a restaurant in China .
we had a three @-@ day meeting , discussing how to translate &quot; welcome to Mc@@ don@@ ald &apos;s &quot; into Chinese , and finally we decided to use &quot; H@@ uan Ying Gu@@ ang Lin . &quot;
after saying these words for over 1,000 times , you will find these words pleasing to the ears .
now these words have become the most commonly used greeting words by all Chinese restaurants in the world .
what does it mean ?
it means we now know how to use our local knowledge effectively , or a kind of local culture .
as Chinese , I think most people will believe in this sentence from the Bible , &quot; For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister . &quot;
in other words , you need to grow your affinity , so that more people are willing to use your services .
fried chicken is considered hard to penetrate the children &apos;s market in China .
however , K@@ FC will set up children &apos;s play@@ grounds at its outlets , displaying many chicken them@@ ed dolls .
chicken are treated as a pet , but the restaurant will still kill the birds to eat . this is very strange .
that &apos;s why McDonald &apos;s quit this idea , as its global strategy is called &quot; I &apos;m lov@@ in &quot; it . &quot;
in other words , McDonald &apos;s has upgraded to a new level , from a child to a youth .
would it the reason that explains why McDonald &apos;s is lagging behind in the Chinese market ?
that &apos;s why we need to have deep roots and find an innovation path .
when talking about design thinking , Apollo 13 is the finest example .
Apollo 11 made its moon landing successfully , as everything had been carefully planned , right ?
but by the time the third mission was carried out , at a time when Apollo 13 had not yet reached the moon , something went wrong and an explosion accident happened on Apollo 13 .
do you know why Apollo 13 could later return back to the Earth ?
it was because they had contingency plans to deal with any possible crisis .
they had a ready menu , and astronauts had undertaken over 100 , or 1000 times of rehear@@ s@@ als to deal with any possible emergency .
in a way , those astronauts would even remember those countermeasures when they were in their dreams .
that is why Apollo 13 later returned back to the Earth .
based on this design thinking , we need to think of the future of your enterprise .
you have followed some particular logic and have gone this far , would it be possible that something will go wrong ?
you can design something beforehand , and keep doing the rehear@@ s@@ als .
only by embracing innovation thinking and developing a real logic , can we walk on the right path of innovation .
it is useless to focus on developing insignificant techniques , and we can &apos;t go much further .
thank you .
hello everyone !
tea , for the Chinese , is a very common beverage .
however , if we go into details , to say that you know tea very well , I think many people would become very unsure .
well , in the past five years , our team has visited all the core tea producing areas in China .
and we have established some of our own knowledge about tea .
so what I would like to do next is to share with you three things .
the first is tea .
the second is Chinese tea .
and the third is Xiao Guan Tea .
what is tea ?
these are the top ten Chinese te@@ as .
I &apos;m sure everybody has an impression of the shapes of those tea leaves .
theses are the te@@ as made from those tea leaves .
as you can see , they all have different shades of color .
well , I remember when I first went to the tea mountain .
I always thought black tea should grow on the tree of black tea .
Pu &apos;er tea should grow on the tree of Pu &apos;er tea .
and green tea on the tree of green tea .
in fact , the trees themselves are not very different .
they are all green leaves before deep processing .
well , different tea leaves have different benefits for health .
so we say tea is a piece of magical leaf .
in the long history of thousands of years .
this leaf has changed into different te@@ as in different historical periods due to different reasons .
the most important point is that tea is an unexpected discovery .
the black tea was created during the war .
well , in Tong@@ mu@@ guan area , Fujian &apos;s Tong@@ mu@@ guan area , after the green tea leaves were prepared , it was not taken care of .
then after the war .
people came back to find that the green tea had changed .
and it became the prototype of today &apos;s so @-@ called black tea .
well people couldn &apos;t bear to throw it away .
so they baked it with fire .
they made tea from it and it tasted good .
this is the discovery of black tea .
what about o@@ ol@@ ong tea ?
how was the aroma of o@@ ol@@ ong tea discovered by shaking the green leaves ( Y@@ ao@@ qing Process ) ?
it is because a large number of tea pl@@ uc@@ kers carried a bamboo basket when pl@@ uc@@ king tea up and down the mountain .
in the process of going up and down the mountain and shaking back and forth , a special aroma was produced .
these are the stories of the Y@@ ao@@ qing process and the creation of the special aroma of o@@ ol@@ ong tea .
they are all unexpected discoveries .
Pu &apos; er tea , which we are familiar with today , is a green tea cake .
it &apos;s made by pressing green tea into a cake because they were taken to the Tibetan area and the pastoral area .
during the transportation process and the post @-@ storage process , a lot of reactions have taken place .
then we got what we call today the vintage tea and cooked tea .
therefore , Chinese tea is an unexpected discovery .
we also say that tea is a lifestyle .
we all know that Japanese drink match@@ a tea , which was introduced to Japan in Tang and Song Dynasties .
the Chinese brewing method today began in the Ming Dynasty .
at the earliest time the tea leaves were cooked , just like cooking the vegetable porridge .
and you can add seas@@ oning , salt and rice into it .
the brewing method we use today has been constantly changing over the past several thousand years in history .
today there are several important tea methods in the world .
the new English afternoon tea , Japanese match@@ a tea , China &apos;s Kun@@ g@@ fu Tea , and these are the three main schools .
well , we also say tea is a healthy &quot; drug . &quot;
why is it a drug ?
alcohol , tobacco and tea , we always put these three together .
as you can see , alcohol , tobacco and tea all come from plants .
tobacco is prepared from tobacco plants , wine is the deep processing product of fruits , and tea also leaves .
well , what do they have in common ?
addiction , drinking addiction , which you can &apos;t get rid of .
and the addiction is very strong .
so what is tea ?
tea is a magical leaf , an unexpected discovery , a lifestyle , and also a healthy &quot; drug . &quot;
in China &apos;s tea industry , there is a very classic saying that 70,000 tea enterprises have lost to one L@@ ip@@ ton .
China is the hometown of tea , Chinese tea .
it is so classic and boasts such a market , why does this happen ?
we always say it is a problem of common sense .
let &apos;s have a look .
for common people , when they mention tea , apart from the ordinary tea and very low @-@ end tea .
there is no clear price perception in their minds .
enterprises don &apos;t have strong product brands .
investors , the entire financial industry , and the entire capital have almost zero contact with the tea industry .
how do young people think of tea ?
they think drinking tea is old @-@ fashioned .
don &apos;t they ?
second , in the office .
if they see a post @-@ 8@@ 0s or post @-@ 9@@ 0s generation go into the office with a cup of tea .
they would think this person is old and sophisticated .
talking about tea always de@@ ters people .
why ?
people find it too much trouble .
and the prices of tea are confusing .
the tea of sky @-@ high prices emerge in endlessly .
then it comes to the problem of brand cognition .
for example , the West Lake Dragon Well tea , who owns the West Lake ?
it &apos;s in Zhe@@ ja@@ ing Pro@@ vic@@ ne .
who owns the Dragon Well ?
the Dragon Well belongs to Zhejiang provincial government .
the name doesn &apos;t indicate the real enterprise .
it is the category brand or the origin brand .
it is not a powerful product brand .
for instance , Pu &apos;er in Yunnan , D@@ ah@@ ong@@ pa@@ o in Wu@@ y@@ ishan and Ti@@ e@@ gu@@ any@@ in in An@@ xi .
they are not product brands , but category brands and origin brands .
so there is no strong product brand .
so this industry , the Chinese tea industry is currently worth 360 billion .
and it is currently among the top 100 , which is less than 10 % of the market share .
in the daily life of Chinese people , tea appears in three aspects .
the common people &apos;s daily necessities ( the firewood , rice , oil , salt , soy sauce , vinegar and tea ) , the necessities for social life ( alcohol , tobacco and tea ) , and the scholar &apos;s necessities ( chess , calligraphy , painting , poetry , wine and tea ) .
the three kinds of tea we talk about are actually different .
the bottom one is an agricultural product .
the middle one is a consumer product .
and the top one is the tea of culture .
in fact , from the perspective of the brand , perhaps the consumer product is more like a tea with a brand .
the agricultural product tea is a bulk tea .
while the culture product is the tea for enthusi@@ asts .
China is the hometown of tea .
but most people don &apos;t know much about tea .
however , we could say that consumers have no obligation to know about tea .
and brands should use their professional ability to tell consumers the truth .
because before the eigh@@ ties .
China &apos;s tea consumption was part of the planned economy , and like cigarettes today .
it was state monopoly of the purchase and marketing .
then 30 years after the opening up .
we thought it still stayed as the agricultural products .
tea production lacks the intensification , standardization and branding .
the intensification is mainly about up@@ stream@@ planting .
standardization is the middle processing procedure .
branding is the downstream commercial end .
so these are the problems .
so now looking at Chinese tea , for example , Xiao Guan Tea .
what we want to do is a modern Chinese tea .
so what &apos;s the difference between its whole design thinking and that of the traditional tea ?
what &apos;s the difference ?
as for tea consumption , involved are no more than three things , buying tea , drinking tea , and sending tea as gifts .
what are people confused about when buying tea ?
there is no standard .
when you arrive at the tea market .
there are te@@ as of 500 yuan , 5,000 yuan or 50,000 yuan .
and you don &apos;t know which is more cost @-@ effective and which is more suitable for you .
as for drinking tea , the brewing method is quite complicated .
when it comes to sending tea as a gift .
there is actually no price .
nowadays when you make brand choices for gifts and presents , te@@ as are actually attached with very clear price tags .
but the te@@ as are actually less superior .
so how do we solve these three problems ?
how do we solve them ?
we started with the product design .
from 20@@ 13 to 20@@ 14 and then to 2015 .
we spent about two and a half years trying to create a new packaging method to solve the primary problem of product standardization .
this is the designer of all our j@@ ars and packaging products , H@@ ide@@ o Kam@@ bara from Japan .
it took us two and a half years to finally create a new packaging method .
which is more convenient and more hygienic .
because all Chinese people , in any scenario when making tea , would grab a handful of tea and put it into the cup .
it &apos;s very un@@ sanitary and careless .
but for decades , everybody thinks it &apos;s all very commonplace .
so we try to create better packaging , which is portable , hygienic , and easier to store .
how could we do this ?
we fill each of our small j@@ ars with nitrogen .
as for the traditional jar , after you pull it open for once .
the freshness of all the tea is damaged .
therefore , we hope to create a better packaging method .
after making countless samples .
we hope to find the best solution to the material and the color of the jar , as well as the lid .
after repeated experiments , our tin jar won &apos;t take too much strength to open .
of course , it is not as easy as opening a yogurt .
but it doesn &apos;t require too much strength .
when we finally finished our exploration .
we set the strength to open the jar to a fixed figure , 18@@ N .
it takes us more than a year of research for this 18@@ N .
and we even set up a special post , whose main job was to tear off the lid .
we not only tear the lid by ourselves , but also got different young men , women and people of different ages to do it .
and we hope to find the smoo@@ thest tear .
so the 18 N is not our imagination .
it has gone through tests .
this is the package .
what about the second one ?
in three years , we have cooperated with eight masters , who have actively promoted the standardization of tea .
each master is a national inher@@ itor of intangible cultural heritage .
we invited the most authoritative tea @-@ making master of each tea category to make a standard for the category as a full @-@ time product supervisors .
in the past , the biggest puzzle was why there are te@@ as of different prices , expensive or cheap .
and how to identify them ?
as a matter of fact , after doing research for about four years .
I summarized these three factors .
I &apos;ll share them with you and you can judge any tea with this standard .
first , the scarcity of the places of origin .
the Pu &apos;er tea from Lao Ban Zhang village is very popular .
it must be very expensive if you &apos;re gonna buy tea from Lao Ban Zhang village , while the tea in the next village is much cheaper .
the second factor is the criterion of pl@@ uc@@ king .
is it a bud with a leaf , a single bud , or a bud with two leaves ?
the uniformity of the leaves of the bud also has a great impact on the cost .
the third factor is the complexity of the process .
for example , the green tea .
the traditional technique of making green tea is relatively simple .
it can be prepared simply by stir @-@ frying .
but for the o@@ ol@@ ong tea .
especially the Rock Tea and Da Hong P@@ ao at the later stage , the baking process at this later stage is very complicated .
the tea is ready in May and but will not be available until September .
why ?
because we bake the tea once a month .
after baking , the heat of the tea is removed in the warehouse .
this process is repeated three times before the tea goes on the market .
therefore , its requirements for this fire@@ work and the complexity of the baking process have a great impact on the cost .
so if you look at any tea from these three perspectives .
you can basically make a quick judgment on the cost .
then we would say that most consumers are un@@ professional .
and more choices mean no choices .
we hope to have uniform standards and simplify consumers &apos; cognition .
I go to a tea shop without knowing how to choose a proper tea .
there are hundreds of choices here .
how should I choose ?
however , there is only one choice for Xiao Guan Tea .
you can choose any category you like .
all the weights , grades and prices are the same .
so our unified small j@@ ars , unified weight , unified grade , unified masters and unified price make consumers &apos; choice simple .
the traditional tea may complicate the simple tea and make money by using asymmetric information .
as for Xiao Guan Tea , when we use our professional ability to present the complicated tea to consumers .
we hope it &apos;s in a simple way .
the tea sets are also used in three scenarios .
when friends come and have tea together .
when one drinks tea in the office or at home by oneself .
the third scenario is when someone is in travel .
these are the core scenarios of tea drinking .
there are a wide variety of tea sets on the market .
but in fact , many people say it is difficult to find a set that is especially suitable for them .
so that &apos;s why we created a unified design style for tea sets .
and the same choice is provided in the scenarios of reception , drinking tea by oneself , and in travel .
why do we make 110 ml cups ?
the traditional Kun@@ g@@ fu Tea is very complicated .
why is it complicated ?
because one drinks up one cup at a time .
after the guests drink one cup of tea , the host has to ref@@ ill the cup , which is very troublesome .
people in the office don &apos;t care too much about the ceremony .
they would use a disposable paper cup .
there is a whole cup of tea when they come and they would leave with half a cup .
so we carried out a test , and made the 110 ml cup , which is the for the normal drinking amount that we usually have for about five minutes .
when the temperature of the tea drops below 60 degrees .
I suppose the tea has already been finished .
that &apos;s why we would say that Xiao Guan Tea is not only about tea .
but we want to provide a complete tea solution for a certain group of people , including the design of the store .
this is Tim Kobe , and this is his first work in China .
it completely changed the traditional way of selling tea .
and also completely changed the image of traditional tea in the eyes of young people , in particular .
it has become very modern .
for tea products , what we need to do is to standardize the design to make users &apos; cognition become simple .
then , for tea set products , what we do is design for life .
hoping that it will be adapted to the different consumption scenarios .
as for the three scenarios of buying , drinking and sending tea as a gift , we have set the standard for buying .
even if you &apos;re not professional .
you can choose any tea you like without much hesitation .
considering the drinking process .
we simplified it and made it very simple and scientific .
when it &apos;s bought as a gift , it &apos;s a gift with a clear price tag .
then , in the scenarios of self @-@ catering and travel .
we re@@ shaped the consumer experience of tea and tea consumption through the design of small j@@ ars , tea sets , stores and factories .
we just said that Chinese tea was an unexpected discovery .
but Xiao Guan Tea was not created by accident .
it was designed by heart .
if today &apos;s young people in China do not accept Chinese tea .
how can the western world enjoy Chinese tea ?
we must make tea modern , young and fully integrated with modern life scenarios .
only when our young people , our post @-@ 8@@ 0s , post @-@ 9@@ 0s and post @-@ 00@@ s all enjoy Chinese tea .
I suppose , that would be the proper time for Chinese tea to go to the world .
we all know that tea is a representative of Chinese culture and a business card of China .
our vision is to bring Chinese tea to the world once again .
therefore , for Xiao Guan Tea , design thinking is no longer a question of establishing a mode of thinking .
in the course of our in @-@ depth practice .
we have been continuously discussing with our team how to improve the efficiency of this organization .
how to form our methodology of design ?
by disruptive innovation and rac@@ king our brains .
we spent three years designing and finally got Xiao Guan Tea .
this process from zero to one really rac@@ ked our brains .
but there is something called gradual innovation .
it is also painstaking , because it is a great test for patience and care@@ fulness .
after the creation from zero to one , it may take even longer to go from 80 points to 85 points and 90 points .
every bit of progress needs more efforts .
therefore , I think it is really very difficult to do well in design and innovation .
if a product is very difficult to use .
it must be a result of the slo@@ pp@@ iness of designers and engineers behind it .
it is the complexity behind the product that makes the user experience really direct and simple and does a good job in user experience .
the complexity behind the product requires companies , engineers , designers and all relevant professionals to work together to turn a complex thing into a simple one with good user experience and present it to consumers .
for all the difficulties , we must use the internal strength of the organization , and professional knowledge to solve them .
at the moment when it is presented to the consumer .
it should be pleasant and simple .
finally , I would like to talk about the narrow @-@ sense thinking and the broad @-@ sense thinking of design .
in the commercial world , in addition to the product design , the marketing model , and industrial chain model all need designs .
it &apos;s just that the design is expressed in different ways , in different vertical directions .
so I think our previous understanding of design thinking may be somewhat vertical in the professional direction .
so we should look at the commercial world in a broader way when it is applied .
I &apos;ve read the book &quot; Design in Design &quot; by Kenya Har@@ a page by page .
after I finished this book , only one sentence stuck in my mind .
it &apos;s &quot; design serves needs . &quot;
well , I think design is born for needs .
design will keep changing the world .
from my personal experience .
I think design is as important as technology .
in the next 30 years , among the driving forces of change in China &apos;s business world .
I think the design is also a very , very important force .
that &apos;s all .
thank you very much !
hello , everyone .
I &apos;m a painter .
I live in this city , and I feel quite happy .
because I can tell stories with my paintings .
as I remember , there was a famous singer named Ang@@ us Tung .
he has a song , Where the Dream St@@ arts .
the lyrics go , &quot; It flows were the leaf swim@@ s in water .
waves smile and fade , it wonders the river no returns ;
dreams and hopes , stay or lose ? &quot;
I grew up in Shanghai , and I love it .
what I &apos;d like to talk about today is that Shanghai is where the dream starts .
I wonder , sometimes , as an artist .
where we are from , and where we are going .
this is a new subject we artists need to reconsider .
we have a long history of 5,000 years .
so , what do we draw from it ?
or what can we inherit from it ?
isn &apos;t it a serious but realistic subject ?
I &apos;d like to share with you my thoughts through my works in recent years .
mythology from the ancient times has always been what I want to paint .
in 2003 , Wu Y@@ ig@@ ong , a famous director , and also my friend , directed the well @-@ known film My Mem@@ ories of Old Beijing .
once , I said to him , now that western civilization is nur@@ tured by western mythology and Greek mythology .
we may summarize eastern or Chinese philosophical systems from our myth@@ ologies .
he commented that it was a good idea .
in the Cl@@ assic of Mountains and Se@@ as , or in various fragmented myths .
what kind of spiritual pillars are told on earth .
I &apos;d like to talk , through our own research results .
about the original intention of the philosophical systems in our ancient Chinese myth@@ ologies .
we all know that in western mythology , human are the creation of God .
but in ours , it &apos;s P@@ ang@@ u who separates the sky from the earth .
our myth tells us , the creativity of the Chinese is totally different from that of the wester@@ ners .
we often mention the heaven , the earth and human .
so , what are they ?
and what kind of force do they generate when they are united ?
we Chinese know it clearly that the unity between human and nature has scientific foundation .
taking the Central Pl@@ ains as the core , we managed to form a multi @-@ ethnic cultural integration .
such a cultural phenomenon brings all the people together on this land of 9.@@ 6 million m@@ 2 .
we are leaving a mist@@ y , chaotic world for the wonderful land of China .
this is such an ad@@ orable subject .
from the Leg@@ end of Yu the Great , my first painting in 1996 , till now , after presenting those legends in my paintings .
I started to look deeper into the heroes in those stories .
our Fu@@ xi and our N@@ ü@@ wa , for example .
they gave birth to Chinese people .
and usually , such figures should be as beautiful as Venus .
but Fu@@ xi , as recorded in our mythology , has human &apos;s head and snake &apos;s body .
that challenged me on how to reproduce those heroes in all the legends in my paintings .
in our myth@@ ologies .
both pretty and charming female figures and warriors of sturdy build tell us that the Chinese ancestors relied on these heroes spirit@@ ually to get over and survive the hard times .
I remember Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche said how Greek gods are established in the Greeks .
because he wanted to demonstrate that it was both as solemn and stirring , and as graceful as the H@@ omer@@ ic hym@@ ns that the Greeks , such a sensitive and sentimental people , could survive under such harsh conditions .
I think it is the same with China .
according to Ni@@ et@@ z@@ sche , one of the great merits of mythology is that all things that consciousness can never grasp can be preserved through sense and spirit in mythology , just as the soul surrounds its body forever .
it is from this that the soul is reflected into our eyes through the body and speaks to our ears .
this is the charm of mythology .
it &apos;s always on my mind that Chinese mythology of the ancient times resembles a gold key to our cultural gene and thoughts .
through those legends .
I want to tell you pursuing the key is like Ku@@ af@@ u running after the sun .
although knowing it was impossible .
he still stuck to it and was willing to die for it .
but peach blossoms blo@@ omed along the way he passed through .
isn &apos;t that romantic ?
so I present the image in my painting .
as we artists present the subject .
we tell you our thoughts about it .
so I invited all artists , no matter the elder ones or younger ones .
to collectively create a series of picture stories including the myths from P@@ ang@@ u to the formation of our country .
I want to tell the story to our children .
such pictures may plant the seed in their hearts and let them know where we are from and where we are going .
I believe such an undertaking is the original intention of us cultural workers .
that &apos;s the mythology I &apos;d like to talk about today .
then I want to tell you my stories .
I &apos;ve travelled to many countries .
although China extensively opens up to the outside world .
the world does not know as much about China as we do about the world .
I remember when I was the cur@@ ator of the China Art Museum ,
Mar@@ k@@ us L@@ ü@@ per@@ tz , a German master of expres@@ sion@@ ism , once visited our museum , and we had a conversation .
he told me , &quot; it &apos;s the first time I come to China .
I thought you are still wearing man@@ dar@@ in jackets and long g@@ owns . &quot;
I felt a bit down after hearing that .
after so many years of opening up .
the impression of China is still un@@ moved for many people of other countries .
I understood that he may just wanted to make a joke .
so I suggested a communication .
and we had a nice one .
we talked about three points , practice , the essence of national culture , and the nature of artists .
to my surprise , after I talked to him , he accepted my invitation .
I also said on that day that I would undertake the reception and exempt him from rent for he was an international master of art .
but he had to pay for the premium as the international convention .
he was quite delighted .
during the exhibition , he said to me , &quot; you see , this work of mine is like your traditional Chinese paintings , with blank space . &quot;
I felt gratified that he finally got a little curious about Chinese culture .
I promised to give him some pieces of Chinese art paper for him to make an attempt .
he gazed bl@@ ank@@ ly for a while and said he would give me an album of painting in return .
through our exchanges .
he knew what we Chinese people were thinking and doing .
there &apos;s another story .
this painting of mine was also on exhibition .
on that day , I received a Greek artist delegation .
and one of them asked me about the story behind my painting .
I told him that the story is like Pro@@ me@@ theus in the Greek myth@@ od@@ ology .
the hero who stole fire to save the mankind at the expense of his life .
and Gu@@ n of China stole from the gods soil to ward off flood .
but it didn &apos;t work eventually , and he also laid down his life .
I also explained that the heroes in Chinese mythology share the same pursuit of the true , the good and the beautiful with the gods in western philosophy and myth@@ ologies .
and he said , &quot; Well , I see . &quot;
so I think , through our artistic works , we can tell the world that China , as an ancient nation , has its cultural foundation .
and this is our cultural confidence .
we live in a common world .
so we need to think over a story in which various cultures are integrated .
it &apos;s fascinating to conduct cultural exchanges through myth@@ ologies .
the subject that everyone in the world is concerned about .
in 1999 , I paid a visit to Taiwan and went to an exhibition at the National Palace Museum in Taipei .
it was a joint exhibition by Zhang Da@@ q@@ ian and Pic@@ asso that compare eastern and western culture . I was greatly inspired .
so I added one more thing .
today we finally arrive at the same end despite different goals , and we have an equal conversation .
when we artists create subjects and art works .
we should be aware of the approach to clarify our stories through our cultural results .
isn &apos;t this a lot of fun ?
I consider myself as a painter and a thoughtful person .
I stayed in my studio every day .
and what makes me feel quite happy is that I can paint many things on paper .
years ago , I got a present from a friend , a book named Einstein , Pic@@ asso .
space , Time , and the Beauty that Ca@@ uses H@@ avo@@ c .
it tells a story , Einstein discovered the theory of relativity in 19@@ 05 and Pic@@ asso created Cu@@ b@@ ism in 19@@ 07 .
they once had the same math teacher .
this is a very special and interesting story about the integration of natural science and social science .
and they also solved a conversion from three @-@ dimensional space to two @-@ dimensional space .
which may be a physical phenomenon but was a great inspiration for me .
let &apos;s put the theory in the world today .
in the face of cultural exchanges and international cultural exchanges .
if there is such a point through which we can treat the world as a plane , the ideas of the Chinese are far ahead the world level .
so , as for this issue , what can we learn from the book ?
we artists should sum up the rationality of our cultural phenomenon from this natural science .
the development of art history is a change in one &apos;s way of observing the world .
in today &apos;s multi @-@ dimensional world .
in the Internet age and the information age , we must have a new view and a new way of thinking to observe and present the world .
therefore , as I paint my thoughts on paper .
I wish , through our own efforts , we use the myths as a starting point and the academic breakthroughs to tell everyone that China is an essential part of the world and can talk to any other country on an equal footing .
because we don &apos;t owe anything to the world .
and we don &apos;t entertain ourselves .
in the context of the world .
we should make it clear that we Chinese have had a complete set of customs , beliefs and systems since 5000 years ago .
and this is the gold key that myth@@ ologies give us .
I especially like the message my son sent me on We@@ Chat days ago .
the remarks of Kobe Bryant , the NBA superstar who retired from the game .
he said at the retirement ceremony .
you work hard enough your dream come true .
but hopefully what you get from tonight is outstanding that those time when you get up early , those times when you stay up late , when you &apos;re too tired , you don &apos;t want to push yourself , but you do it anyway .
that is actually the dream .
that &apos;s dream itself .
what matters is not the destination , but the journey .
if you guys can understand that then what you &apos;ll see happen is that you won &apos;t accomplish your dreams , your dreams won &apos;t come true , something greater will . &quot;
I &apos;d like to share his remarks with you .
our city is ever changing , and the only thing artists can find constant .
is our artists &apos; persistent pursuit of art and the embrace of the full loneliness .
dreams will come true .
thank you .
I am not sure if aerospace industry can totally change the future .
but it will certainly influence it .
what I &apos;m going to talk about today will influence your future .
so please listen carefully .
many people probably know nothing about spac@@ ef@@ light , or rockets .
they may not have seen a real rocket , or even ever noticed it .
as I said , my talk today may influence your life and behavior .
let us start with rocket .
here is a video .
please pay attention to the last sentence .
tracking is normally working .
unfortunately , about 300 seconds later .
the thrust stopped and the rocket crashed into the atmosphere .
what kind of rocket is this ?
this is the largest rocket that we have developed in China in the 10 years from 2006 to 20@@ 16 .
it had a take@@ off thrust of 1,0@@ 64 tons , which equals eight 100 @-@ ton engines and two 75 @-@ ton engines that fire at the same time .
it could increase the carrying capacity of existing low @-@ orbit rockets from 10 tons to 25 tons .
and that of high @-@ orbit rockets from 5 tons to 15 tons , an increase of 1.5 times .
this rocket was supposed to take on a particularly important task in the future .
and we did have great expectations for it .
but unfortunately , the first blow is half the battle .
although it has some problems .
its responsibility has not been reduced .
and it still carries many tasks .
look , its failure has caused a tremendous impact .
this is Chang &apos;@@ e 5 .
our Phase III project included orbiting , landing and returning .
we were going to sample the far side of the moon , vertically and later@@ ally .
that was supposed to be the time that we got the most samples from the moon .
however , the task is now uncertain due to the rocket problem .
we also planned to launch the Ti@@ ang@@ ong Station in 2020 .
we were going to build a short @-@ term manned space station and send up a 100 @-@ ton lab cabin for scientific experiments .
however , due to the failure of Long March 5 , our mission was affected .
OK .
W@@ what other missions do we have ?
as you know , aircraft carriers from some countries often sail near our home into the South China Sea , the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea .
it doesn &apos;t matter if it comes .
the point is , can we know it &apos;s coming ?
what &apos;s it for ?
what it brings is not a gift , but a deterrent .
can you see where the carrier battle group is ?
in the vast sea , an aircraft carrier battle group is as big as a mil@@ let grain , which is really hard to find .
if you don &apos;t have an early warning satellite or something .
you don &apos;t even know where they are .
by the time you see it , it will have wiped you out .
our Bei@@ D@@ ou Navi@@ gation Satellite System is supposed to include 35 satellites in its global network by 2020 , for navigation , positioning and timing .
so , we are going to launch 16 satellites this year .
if you look at the graph on the right .
you can find that more disasters have occurred in recent years , including earthquakes , storms , abnormal weather , mountain tor@@ rents and hur@@ ric@@ anes .
post @-@ disaster reconstruction also requires a clear picture of the situation acquired with instruments and equipment .
you may still remember the 2008 earthquake in Wenchuan .
we did not even know the situation in Be@@ ichuan .
why ?
we did not have an emergency satellite team to observe the situation in the earthquake @-@ stricken area .
we could only do whatever we could to break through the road to Be@@ ichuan with determination by the next morning .
will the determination work ?
nobody knew .
because whether the road would be broken through depended on the actual conditions , not our determination .
it is difficult for us to take effective measures without knowing the situation in the earthquake area .
we need the help of our satellite fleet .
so many tasks .
how many satellites have we launched in the five years ?
we launch about 15 @-@ 20 satellites every year .
the number peaked at 22 in 20@@ 16 .
the same as that of America , ranking first in the world .
people may ask , can you launch more ?
yes , we can .
but we need stronger productivity .
we usually start three years in advance the development of rocket part .
the assembly and testing of sub@@ systems , and then the assembly and testing , and then the launch .
it takes at least 15 days to launch the satellite .
sometimes , it costs more than 100 days .
we almost launch a satellite every month now .
some believe that the frequency is already very good .
it is better than that in the Europe and Japan .
sometimes even similar to that of the US .
however , it is far from enough .
why do we call the year 20@@ 18 a new start ?
how many tasks do we have ?
let us take a look .
it is 35 , which is supposed to be a record in the history of satellite launching in China .
I have to say that I &apos;m not sure about that .
why ?
almost three launches a month .
three launches a month , and a total of 35 times a year .
no one is allowed to fail !
if one of them fails .
we &apos;ll have to postpone all our plans .
there is no margin in our plan .
if anything should go wrong .
we will have to adjust our plan and the tasks will certainly not be accomplished on time .
what did we do at the very beginning of 20@@ 18 ?
we launched three rockets within 10 days , including Long March 2@@ D , Long March 3@@ B and Long March 11 .
they are all rockets .
what is the difference ?
they are small but indeed very different .
long March 2@@ D is a two @-@ stage rocket designed for low and sun @-@ synchronous orbits of 200 @-@ 800 kilometers .
long March 3@@ B is for Bei@@ D@@ ou satellite at the height of 3@@ 5,000 kilometers .
the picture on the far left is a solid rocket .
it can be 24 @-@ hour available when needed in emergency such as disasters .
the three rockets actually sign@@ alled the beginning of our plan in this year .
the task this year is almost impossible to complete .
why ?
we don &apos;t know .
we dare not say that we will accomplish the task , or even exceed it .
there are still many issues to resolve .
we have to control the cost , shorten the launch cycle , get sufficient personnel strength .
and especially ensure the effective means and ability for quality control .
we can &apos;t guarantee that nothing will go wrong .
if anything goes wrong .
the whole plan will go up in smoke .
the task of 35 launches represents huge pressure .
can we accomplish it ?
we hope that we can , through hard work .
what does the market expect of us ?
we have great earth observation technology .
our technology has advanced by leaps and bounds .
and our earth observation range has increased from 200 kilometers to 3,000 kilometers and then to 30,000 kilometers .
the accuracy of observation ranges from 10 meters to 5 meters , and then 3 meters , 1 meter and 0.5 meters .
now , it can be 0.1 meters .
the accuracy is also great .
the accuracy of 0.1 meter means that we can see from tens of thousands of meters high whether you wear glasses , identify your appearance and your license plate number .
the data we observed can be used in fields such as social governance and national defense construction .
people have also been paying close attention to Wi@@ Fi , which is already available on Fu @-@ H@@ sing Express .
but not yet on CR@@ H .
you can also use Wi@@ Fi on the plane since the day before yesterday .
many people are pretty optimistic about this .
but I have concerns .
this is China@@ S@@ at 2@@ A last year .
the most important feature of Wi@@ Fi is its convenience and rap@@ idity .
a third of the world &apos;s flights are now equipped with Wi@@ Fi .
2 / 3 of the American flights have Wi@@ Fi available on board .
among the rest of the flights in the world .
only 13 % of them are equipped with Wi@@ Fi .
we do not have many such flights in China now .
there is still a long way to go .
but we are convinced that we can do it .
sooner or later , we will provide our passengers on Fu @-@ H@@ sing Express , CR@@ H and all our flights with convenient mobile communication services .
it is a mission of ours .
also , I didn &apos;t expect the traffic jams in cities like Beijing and Shanghai to be so serious now .
I have to ask that does it really have to be like this ?
let us imagine .
one day in the future .
we may have intelligent roads , signals , control system and intelligent cars .
will there still be such a problem at that time ?
I was looking at the Huang@@ pu River the other day in the Inter@@ continental Hotel .
I suddenly realized that the boats in the river were not crowded at all .
they were , to some extent , orderly .
if all the cars , signals , roads and inter@@ sections were in order , there would be no congestion .
mobile , internet , we will reach smart internet of things next .
incredible , isn &apos;t it ?
we just mentioned the safety of mobile phones .
some people can &apos;t wait to embrace the smart internet of things .
but the thing is , when it comes .
you may leave your personal information on the chair by just sitting on it .
your wife may realize that another person has slept on your bed when she comes back .
you may be told that your ber@@ i@@ ber@@ i gets worse the moment you put your shoes on .
that is crazy .
but technology will ever go forward .
we will always upgrade it .
problems and needs drive our technological progress .
how are we improving our technology ?
we need to use what we have accomplished over and over again .
we managed to recycle the rockets of S@@ pac@@ e@@ X .
but is it really hard ?
yes !
is it ?
no !
is it really about the technology ?
no , it is about policy .
why ?
why do we bring the rocket back ?
for cost control ?
a new rocket can be sold at RMB 100 million .
but a recycled one is only RMB 10 million .
does anyone want to do that then ?
no .
but the policy tells you that you have to .
it is not a big technical barrier .
we can use the parachute .
there is also vertical recycle and some other ways available .
the point lies in the policy .
in fact , we can launch the rocket at sea .
we can launch some small commercial satellites on the high seas .
when they come back , they will only hit the water , or at most some fish , not people .
some parts of the rocket were reported to have landed in Guizhou , Sichuan , Qinghai or Ningxia , sm@@ ashing up homes .
it is almost impossible to find a place without people in China now .
so you have to focus on the rocket and try to make sure that it does not kill any people .
if the house collapses .
we can still help rebuild it .
it is a better idea to launch at sea , where there are not crowded Chinese .
then , we can take all the engines for rocket and aircraft and launch for sub@@ orbital flight .
buy the ticket as soon as you can .
it is not that expensive .
try the sub@@ orbital flight and take a look at the beautiful blue planet .
I have watched it when launching the Bei@@ D@@ ou satellite a few years ago .
through the camera on the rocket , you can see two satellites coming toward the earth .
it &apos;s a stunning blue planet .
I was so excited at that 3 o &apos;clock in the morning to watch the launch .
the earth is so breathtaking .
we have been complaining about many problems on it .
but it is just beautiful .
let us move on to heavy rocket .
first of all .
what is big rocket ?
how much does it weigh ?
more than 1,000 tons
what is heavy rocket ?
it is 3,000 tons .
it can carry 100 tons of objects to the height of 200 kilometers .
we are working to complete the R &amp; D of our heavy rocket by 2030 .
the rapid development of technology means the arrival of commercial aerospace .
it can be said that 20@@ 18 is the first year of commercial spac@@ ef@@ light .
we will see huge business opportunities in the fields of commercial launch , space tourism and integration of space and earth .
commercial spac@@ ef@@ light has taken off around the world .
S@@ pac@@ e@@ X from the US is a great competitor , I think .
it does a lot of important things with such a small team .
I &apos;m probably old .
but that &apos;s not the point .
different systems lead to different productivity developments .
we strive to promote the reform of the system in order to promote the rapid development of productivity .
fortunately , we have witnessed the emergence and good momentum of commercial spac@@ ef@@ light industry in our country .
look at all these companies .
we have satellite companies , commercial satellite companies , rocket companies , measurement and control companies .
and we are also preparing launch sites for commercial spac@@ ef@@ light .
when these are available .
we will see development space for commercial spac@@ ef@@ light .
there will be some un@@ ic@@ or@@ ns .
how big is this market ?
tr@@ illi@@ ons of RMB !
where is the next big opportunity ?
it is in commercial spac@@ ef@@ light .
anything can happen there .
there are many projects to complete and a huge space to explore .
I believe that we will definitely gain success there in the future .
in 19@@ 35 , a Soviet died . his epit@@ ap@@ h said that the earth is the cradle of humanity .
but humans do not always stay in the cradle .
how long have humans been on the earth ?
three million years .
how many species died out in the three million years ?
many .
will mankind perish ?
as we can live as at most 100 years or so , we may not see that day .
but human beings , like other species , will perish one day .
when the descendants of our descendants are going to perish .
they may ask .
why haven &apos;t we prepared a backup planet for them ?
why don &apos;t we use technology to let them fly to another planet and live as happily as we do now ?
if we have spirits in heaven , we may shed tears of shame when we hear questions from future generations .
such a day seems so far away .
but our space engineers are doing this .
and we &apos;re spar@@ ing no efforts .
we are going to find another Earth for our children and grandchildren to live on in the future .
thank you .
ten years ago , when I worked and studied in the United States .
because of my work , I used to fly from the eastern part of the United States to the western part .
during the flight , I would sit beside the por@@ th@@ ole , through which I could see clearly the land and admire the green circles on the fields .
this is America &apos;s intensive farmland , which covers more than 3,000 acres , with the largest diameter of 1.6 kilometers .
this is a good example of the most efficient breeding , cultivation and management model in the US .
later , I visited many agricultural regions in the US , but I was particularly interested in the Central Valley of California .
this narrow , flat valley is sandw@@ ich@@ ed between the Sierra Nevada and the Coast Mountains .
and it stretches only 7@@ 20 kilometers , or 450 miles long and , it is 60 to 100 kilometers or 40 to 60 miles wide .
this little valley is one of the most important agricultural regions in the US .
it produces half of America &apos;s vegetables , fruits and nuts .
there are 300 million people in the United States , but its rural population takes up less than 2 % of the whole population and its agricultural employment population is a mere 1 % .
that is to say , three million farmers produce one @-@ fifth of the world &apos;s food , which can feed two billion people .
to take a concrete example , the food can not only feed a population two times of the US , but a whole India .
why is America &apos;s agriculture so productive ?
with this question , I went to Pennsylvania , Illinois , Iowa , Utah , Arkansas and Washington , all of which are agricultural states in the United States .
therefore , American farmers have a relatively high salary , which is generally higher than that of the urban residents .
for example , in Iowa , the farmers earn an annual income of between $ 50,000 and $ 70,000 .
and some of them even make it to $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 a year .
so in the United States , the threshold for engaging in farming is very high .
after rounds of investigation , I came to realize that the high yield is due to the extensive use of modern science and technology , especially the seed breeding .
in 2007 , I ended my work in the United States .
and in 2008 , I started my work at the Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences .
this is my team .
we have only 2 million mu or 13@@ 33.@@ 3 km ² of farmland in Shanghai , but we adopt the most advanced technology in our farmland .
last year &apos;s statistics reveal that Shanghai ranks first in the country in terms of the modernization of agriculture .
I mainly engaged in supervision and inspection tests of crop seeds and environmental safety , as well as crop nutritional for@@ tification .
a decade of research , learning , and investigation gives me a deep understanding of the overall situation of the Chinese agriculture .
and it also makes me realize how important seeds are for a country like ours .
we are a large agricultural country , but we are not a great one .
our food self @-@ sufficiency rate falls short of 90 % , and even slum@@ ps below 87 % .
the growth rate of yield per unit area only reaches 0.6 % , but we need to produce 35 million tons of new food each year to meet our needs .
since 2012 , we have imported six crops such as grain , oil and cotton .
we are the world &apos;s largest importer of soybeans , cotton and rice , and a major importer of corn , wheat and can@@ ola .
but in 1997 , we were the world &apos;s major exporter of rice and wheat .
currently , the red line of the total arable land is set at no less than 1.8 billion mu or 120 million hectares .
but last year only 1.6 billion mu was cultivated .
currently the arable land is 123 million mu less than that of 1997 .
with one @-@ fifth of the world &apos;s population , we need 20 % of the world &apos;s cultivated land .
and 24.@@ 7 % or even 25 % of grain and oil to feed ourselves .
we often say that we should hold the rice bowl tightly in our hands .
more than any other time in history , we now urgently need high @-@ quality seeds to achieve this goal .
but how to obtain quality seeds ?
ever since the crop seeds were discovered , human beings have tried endlessly to find quality seeds for tens of thousands of years .
10,000 years ago , rice and wheat were like grasses .
and 5,@@ 300 years ago , when Mexic@@ ans discovered the corn .
it was only as small as the little finger .
the Dutch were among the first to discover the carrot , which was purple at that time .
after endless trials , the Dutch bre@@ ed@@ ers managed to transform the purple carrots into the orange variety , the same color as their national flag .
they are very patriotic because the color orange is the symbol of the Dutch royal family .
it is the endless efforts of bre@@ ed@@ ers that accelerate the development of seeds .
actually , the seeds of all our current agricultural products are quite different from their original appearance , but they are full of vitality .
which means that nature is dynamic , and it is not static .
Norman Bor@@ lau@@ g , a famous American bree@@ der , led the first Green Revolution .
a dwarf spring @-@ wheat variety he bred saved one billion people in the Indian Sub@@ continent from starvation .
therefore , he won the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize , which is the first time such a prize was awarded to an agricultural scientist .
in 1986 , he established the World Food Prize , which has become the v@@ ane of the food and seeds development in the world .
in 2004 , Yuan Long@@ ping was awarded the World Food Prize for his great contribution to breeding hybrid rice varieties .
in 20@@ 13 , the prize went to three scientists who pione@@ ered the use of genetic engineering techniques in agriculture .
in 2006 , the honor was awarded to four scientists in nutritional for@@ tification of crops .
who granted 10 million people access to adequately nutritious food .
the prizes of the World Food Prize in the field of breeding also represent the goal of breeding .
what is it ?
it &apos;s to improve the quantity and quality of food in the world .
chemical agriculture has made huge contributions to improving the quantity of food , but it also brings heavy burdens .
in 20@@ 16 , China produced 70 million tons of chemical fertilizers and 3.@@ 77 million tons of pesticides .
half of them were exported , and the other half went to our fields .
the invisible &apos; haze &apos; in the soil and water is much more serious than haze in the air , posing a potential threat to our health .
for example , only 0.1 % of the insec@@ tici@@ de has an effect on the pests , and 99 % goes to the field , flowing into the water .
the soil is also over@@ loaded .
to maintain high yields every year , we have to draw on agricultural chemicals .
therefore , the organic matter in our soil is only a quarter of that in developed countries .
but can we drop the use of pesticides and fertilizers ?
they are good things , and they contribute a lot to our food harvest .
with a 40 % contribution to food , and a 45 % or even 50 % contribution to vegetables .
but currently a trendy model of green agriculture has taken hold across the world .
in the field of fertilizers , the initiative of replacing chemical fertilizers with organic ones has been fully rolled out .
in developed countries , organic fertilizers have replaced more than 40 % of chemical fertilizers , 76 % in Japan , 70 % in the US , and 40 % in France and Italy .
but in China , that number is a mere 5 % , and the products are of different qualities .
to develop green agriculture , we have to replace the chemical production models with green ones .
the core of the development is the seeds .
the core of breeding lies in its hereditary nature .
the core of cultivation lies in its physiology .
by hereditary , we mean we have to understand the nature of the genes of the seeds .
but by physiology , we mean we have to make a friendly , harmonious combination of the seeds and the environment , promoting mutual development .
if one day , the orange planted in the north can be as sweet and delicious as that in the south .
the idiom &quot; South O@@ range and North @-@ Tri@@ foli@@ ate O@@ range &quot; will become a thing of the past .
in order to organ@@ ically combine the hered@@ ity of breeding with the physiology of cultivation , synthetic agriculture brings hope .
synthetic agriculture is an efficient breeding system based on the molecular machinery of synthetic biology .
the system consists of all aspects of advanced biotechnology .
including bio@@ inform@@ atics technology , gene editing techniques , gene sequencing technology and protein expression technology .
in other words , we can use our imagination and manually design a system and a module and synthesize them into a new biological system that can help accomplish our goal .
what kind of goal ?
we can use it to produce the nutrients we need , even vaccines , active proteins , and health supplements .
we can also transfer all the good traits into one seed .
and by transferring to the microorganisms the entire metabolic pathway of a very expensive drug or active substances that we need .
we can also form a microbial plant by fermentation .
in 2009 , we published a very important paper in the one of journals of the American Society for Micro@@ biology , or AS@@ M .
the AS@@ M has praised our paper as one of the pioneering projects of green chemistry .
we transferred an expensive chemical raw material called 1,@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ pan@@ edi@@ ol , to E. coli .
the E. coli friendly embraced the entire an@@ abolic pathway of 1,@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ pan@@ edi@@ ol , which is just like a small factory .
we moved in .
1,@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ pan@@ edi@@ ol is a very important chemical in the fields of agriculture , medicine and energy .
what &apos;s more , the E. coli can transform agricultural waste such as stra@@ ws to produce 1,@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ pan@@ edi@@ ol .
this way helps to greatly reduce the cost and improve the pollution @-@ plagued chemical process .
this is our first successful attempt at synthetic biology .
in 20@@ 16 , we combined the advanced gen@@ om@@ ic re@@ arrangement technology and molecular module techniques to develop a straw mushroom variety resistant to low temperature .
straw mushrooms are not a new thing to us .
they are readily available in the summer , but they are quite hard to be found in winter .
why ?
straw mushrooms are very nutritious and they are among the most expensive vegetables in the supermarket in summer . however , they have a unique feature : they tend to resolve at low temperatures .
if we put them in the fridge , they will be dissolved into liquid in less than one night .
this is the cancer of straw mushrooms and many experts want to conquer it .
so do we , what can be done to solve the problem ?
finally , we decided to adopt the gen@@ om@@ ic re@@ arrangement .
the technology was previously implemented in low @-@ level bacteria such as E. coli and Bac@@ illus sub@@ til@@ is .
but not in higher organisms and higher fungi .
this is no easy task .
we had to make calculations , and adopt new algorithms , new methods to continuously integrate the two .
we selected a large number of straw mushrooms of different varieties from different sources .
and sequ@@ enced a large number of genetic gen@@ omes of different varieties to obtain different traits .
then , we re@@ shuff@@ led these traits , which are represented by the genes , in the ways we imagined .
and we ended up with a new variety of straw mushroom , which is resistant to low temperatures .
and this time , if we put them in the fridge for two days , they will be just as fresh as the new @-@ picked ones .
after the article was published in the cover of the journal .
I received a large number of letters from experts and institutions both at home and abroad .
why ?
they say that this method opens up a new way of breeding edible fungi .
a project we &apos;re working on now is related to corn .
we are trying to develop a very nutritious variety of corn , fresh corn .
you must be very familiar with it .
Shanghai is the biggest consumer of fresh corn in China .
which is what we often call sweet corn and wa@@ xy corn .
we are very curious about how we can put the whole synthetic pathway of fol@@ ic acid into the corn seed .
why ?
fol@@ ic acid is very important nutrient for human beings , but we cannot synthesize it ourselves .
the lack of fol@@ ic acid will increase the risk of coronary heart disease , Par@@ kinson &apos;s syndrome , stroke and other cancers .
if a pregnant woman suffers from a lack of fol@@ ic acid , it will lead to the underdevelopment of the fetus .
every year , 150,000 children around the world are born with defects due to the lack of fol@@ ic acid .
this is a grave problem .
however , we often supplement the artificially synthesized fol@@ ic acid .
but recent research shows that excessive consumption of such fol@@ ic acid can increase the risk of colon cancer and prostate cancer .
but if we combine biology , the synthetic agriculture , and the molecular simulation .
we can move the factory @-@ like synthetic pathway of fol@@ ic acid to fresh corn , and to sweet corn .
and in the near future , a sweet corn could provide the necessary amount of fol@@ ic acid for one day .
what a wonderful thing !
this picture must be very familiar to you .
it is the new version of Al@@ pha@@ Go , also known as the Al@@ pha Z@@ ero released last October .
this robot , I call it a zero zero dog , is very powerful .
with no prior knowledge of the chess games .
he conducted 8@@ - hour deep learning and beat the Al@@ pha@@ Go by 100 : 0 , its predecessor who defeated K@@ e Jie , a world @-@ famous Chinese chess player .
what does this mean ?
it means that in just 8 hours , Al@@ pha@@ Z@@ ero explores and masters the GO , the most complicated chess game , even far better than humans .
the pace of scientific progress goes far beyond our imagination .
just like people who lives 100 years ago and cannot imagine the current way of life .
we still can &apos;t imagine what kind of life or production model there will be 100 years from now .
when artificial intelligence is combined with agriculture , what will it bring ?
it will establish a new management model and system for breeding .
the cloud biotechnology , which integrates loud computing , big data , and plant biology , has appeared in the United States .
we can use advanced bi@@ os@@ ens@@ ors to scan the seeds and seedlings just like CT .
thousands of seedlings are placed around the sensors .
where they are quickly arranged by the phen@@ otype , its leaves , its temperature , moisture , stress resistance , physiology and its level of chlor@@ ophy@@ ll .
this way , we can spot out the best of the seedlings within a short time .
the seedling is then brought to the bree@@ der , who quickly screens good genes , or modi@@ fies its genes to obtain quality agricultural products , which are resistant to diseases , stress and drought .
apart from screening high @-@ quality genes , the cloud biotechnology can also monitor the climate , conduct precision irrigation and apply fertilizers .
these applications have begun to take shape in America .
in the tens of thousands of acres of wheat fields .
the sensors can calculate how many fertilizers I should apply this year and how much water I should use at each stage .
this greatly reduces costs .
another interesting project is related to microbes .
we can screen thousands of microbes in nature .
we didn &apos;t have such technology before .
so we just drew pictures on the tablet and learned about some of its preliminary traditional phen@@ otyp@@ es .
with big data and genetic sequencing now , we can acquire a lot of information , but how ?
machine learning , or deep learning help to classify and decom@@ pose the genes , and find the best genes .
it looks for microbes , the friendly microbes .
just like our humans , some microbes are in love , some are making friends , and some are playing We@@ Chat .
and some of them are far away and don &apos;t know each other .
however , we bring the microbes together so that they can work towards one thing .
what kind of thing ?
to help the seeds .
so we can find a large number of microbial flora , and plant them in the seeds .
just as a healthy human being must have healthy gut microbes , a healthy seed should also have healthy microbial flora .
the healthy seed flora can help seeds to ger@@ min@@ ate , resist disease and stress , gain nutrients and thrive .
at the same time , it can also conduct self @-@ reproduction by using 50 % of the products of photosyn@@ thesis metabolism .
thus forming an organic cycle between seeds , plants and soil .
this is also a very harmonious society .
look at this , this is a seed of corn .
what &apos;s the blue part inside ?
well , scientists have dyed these microorganisms so that we can see visually the harmonious relation between the microorganisms and the seeds .
they help the seeds to grow and resist stress .
in particular , some microorganisms give out antibacterial substances which can kill germs in the soil .
and if we spray them onto the foliage , we can only reduce the use of pesticides , but get rid of the pests .
well , one of our projects is related to this .
what are we accumulating ?
we are accumulating some of the microbial flora that can conduct biological fixation of nitrogen and get along with each other .
so that they can quickly and effectively transfer the nitrogen and some other nutrients in the soil to the plants , greatly reducing the use of fertilizers .
at the same time , they can also give out anti @-@ bacterial substances .
and we can reduce the use of pesticides by spraying them on the leaves . this is our goal .
in the past 100 years , we have adopted all kinds of techniques in agriculture and ensured the food output meets the needs of human beings .
but I &apos;m not optimistic about the next 100 years .
and especially by 2030 , we will encounter some technological bottlen@@ ec@@ ks .
our population continues to expand , and the food problem has yet to be solved .
this is not only a problem for us , but for the whole world .
as an old saying goes , food is the first necessity of the people , the major source of food is crops , and the major issue with crops is security .
so the biggest issue is food security .
so we must develop new technologies .
the Green Revolution in the 1960s achieved the first surge in agricultural production .
the second Green Revolution in the 1990s was driven by genetic engineering , and we still enjoy its benefits .
by 2020 , another green revolution featuring synthetic agriculture technology is coming and we must embrace it with open arms .
why ?
because it can not only significantly increase agricultural productivity .
but revolution@@ alize our traditional agricultural production models and bring about a great revolution .
when I was young , I was a big fan of music and now I still am .
I used to imagine being a musician or being a composer when I grow up .
why ?
because I have a pair of sensitive ears , and I can understand every note .
I can write down any melody I hear .
so in college , I wrote a lot of songs and organized a music band .
thank you !
so when I read the gene sequences , I often wonder it would be nice if I could translate them into music scores .
why so ?
this is an interesting topic .
all proteins are composed of 20 kinds of amino acids and are en@@ coded by DNA .
I can translate them , if I can transform them from a vic@@ es@@ imal number to a hex@@ ad@@ ec@@ imal number .
then each gene is a musical score , and each an@@ abolic pathway is a movement .
it is a wonderful thing that I can hear the melody of the gene expression .
the French writer F@@ lau@@ bert once said that science and art are se@@ per@@ ated at the base but they will re@@ join at the summit .
the seeds cultivated by synthetic agriculture are the most beautiful art@@ works that nature has bestowed on me .
I used to regret that I didn &apos;t major in music .
but when I studied life sciences , I realized that it is the most beautiful artistic discipline that nature has given me .
the ro@@ oting , spr@@ outing , flowering , and fru@@ iting of the seeds are a beautiful melody .
it is like a symphony , as colorful as the Sound of Spring .
if I can write down the melody of seeds , it must be the sound of green , of harvest , and also of life .
and I will make unremitting efforts for this .
thank you !
I got an invitation from &quot; Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u Talk &quot; when I was at the X@@ ic@@ hang Satellite La@@ unch Center located at the remote area of the D@@ ali@@ ang Mountains .
the two Bei@@ D@@ ou Navi@@ gation Sat@@ ell@@ ites , developed by the navigational satellite research team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences .
f@@ ave been transferred to the launch zone under the protection of fair@@ ing .
here &apos;s a photo I took with my phone .
the sky is unbeliev@@ ably blue , isn &apos;t it ?
after being delivered to the launch zone , our satellites and the rocket stood still on the launch tower awaiting various inspections before the launch and the final firing command .
eight days ago , at 7 : 18 in the morning of January 1st , China had the satellites launched in the way of an arrow binary .
after three and a half hours of flight alongside with the upper stage , the satellites smoothly separated from the upper stage of the laun@@ cher at noon on that day .
and then the two satellites proceeded to go into their orbits .
once the in @-@ orbit test and the network verification are confirmed , the two satellites will provide services for our global users .
traditionally , we consider Be@@ id@@ ou as the Big D@@ ipper that comprises Du@@ b@@ he , Mer@@ ak , Ph@@ ec@@ da , Me@@ gre@@ z , Ali@@ oth , M@@ iz@@ ar and Al@@ k@@ aid .
our ancestors were truly imaginative in imag@@ ining the stars as a wine di@@ pper .
which we called Be@@ id@@ ou .
we use the Big D@@ ipper and the North Star to distinguish different seasons and determine our locations .
however , the Be@@ id@@ ou I talk about today ,
is China &apos;s Be@@ id@@ ou Navi@@ gation System .
based on national security and economic and social demands , it &apos;s a global satellite navigation system developed and built on our own .
the system includes space segment , i.e. , the satellites , the ground segment and the users .
actually , all of you are the users of Be@@ id@@ ou .
it contains 3 geo@@ stationary earth orbit satellites , G@@ EO satellite in short , 3 inclined ge@@ osyn@@ chron@@ ous orbit satellites , i.e. , IG@@ SO satellites , and 24 medium orbit earth satellites .
as we know , China started to build the system in 1994 .
while the GPS of the United States and the G@@ L@@ ON@@ AS@@ S of Russia were initiated much earlier .
it is no exaggeration to say that a well @-@ developed satellite navigation system best represents the country &apos;s comprehensive strength .
the United States continues to improve the accuracy and immunity of their GPS from interference , attack and utilization .
so as to sustain its dominance in the world .
as for Russia .
by overcoming its domestic economic hardship .
it has regained its autonomous control over G@@ L@@ ON@@ AS@@ S and will broaden the system &apos;s application .
well , the Be@@ id@@ ou I am about to say is a system that partly takes the lead globally and shows Chinese characteristics .
EU , the ally of the United States , is also developing its own system , G@@ AL@@ IL@@ EO .
apart from the global navigation systems .
Japan is establishing its Qu@@ asi @-@ Z@@ en@@ ith Satellite System , and India is working for its regional navigation satellite system .
in doing so , they try to develop their own navigation capacity .
Rome was not built in a day .
so was Be@@ id@@ ou . it also took a fairly long time to complete Be@@ id@@ ou .
the year of 1994 marked its prototype .
and in 2000 , we took the first step , the BD @-@ I was completed and put into operation .
in terms of the second step , BD @-@ II was composed of 14 satellites and more than 30 ground stations .
it was officially announced on December 27 , 2012 that the BD @-@ II started to offer the functions , such as positioning , velocity measurement , time service , with the accuracy of a dec@@ imeter level in Asia @-@ Pacific region .
the BD @-@ III , the real Be@@ id@@ ou global navigation system , was initiated in 2009 .
on November 5 last year , the first two satellites of the BD @-@ III were launched .
and just on January 12 , the second pair was launched .
in 20@@ 18 , we will carry out 9 ~ 10 times of intensive launch for 18 ME@@ O satellites .
by then , we will be able to offer services to countries along the B &amp; R .
in 2020 , we plan to complete the launch and deployment of 35 satellites , which provide services for global users .
after that , we will form a city of sky named &quot; Be@@ id@@ ou &quot; in the space .
from BD @-@ II to BD @-@ III , there were numerous researchers who made extremely hard and strenuous effort .
however , it is not only the number of satellites that has changed .
what else has changed ?
first , its service need to be extended to the whole globe from regions .
its aerospace capability need to be upgrade from regional scale to global scale .
in addition , it need to be compatible and inter@@ oper@@ able with GPS , G@@ L@@ ON@@ AS@@ S and G@@ AL@@ IL@@ EO .
second , compared with the BD @-@ II , the accuracy has been substantially enhanced .
from the accuracy of 10 m to 2.5 ~ 5 m for regional system .
actually , the BD @-@ III I just mentioned is planned to secure in 5 ~ 6 years the improvement that took GPS more than 20 years .
so , what are the relevant work we have done ?
first , the Be@@ id@@ ou system is the first in the world to realize heterogeneous constellation .
systems such as GPS and G@@ AL@@ IL@@ EO are actually ME@@ O satellites , while our Be@@ id@@ ou system is a heterogeneous constellation composed of G@@ EO satellites , IG@@ SO satellites and ME@@ O satellites .
it realizes global coverage . meanwhile , since some stationary positions are above our country , it can provide us with more accurate and higher @-@ performance services .
besides , we &apos;ve developed navigational signals with our own intellectual property .
basically , the system functions by accepting its signals .
to put it in a simple way , we can now provide signals with higher quality in a shorter time .
so our users can enjoy faster and better positioning .
as we know , time is the basis of positioning .
so the satellite @-@ borne time and frequency are the basic indicators of our navigation satellite .
the BD @-@ III is equipped with hydrogen mas@@ er clock and ru@@ bi@@ dium clock with higher accuracy .
we know that a mechanical watch works with errors . it may devi@@ ate from the real time by one second per day .
well , a quartz watch may be better , 0.1 second per day .
but the deviation of the ru@@ bi@@ dium clock on our satellites is ten times ten to the negative four@@ teenth power second per 10,000 seconds , while that of the hydrogen mas@@ er clock is even smaller .
ten times ten to the negative fifteenth power second per 10,000 seconds .
in other words , the clocks on the satellites produce a deviation of one second in 3 million years to 10 million years .
there is no exaggeration to call them the strongest brain .
it is due to such highly precise atomic clocks that our satellites can provide more accurate positioning and better signals .
well , just like our body , apart from a strong heart .
we also need unob@@ struc@@ ted main and collateral channels .
a traditional satellite navigation system includes three parts , as I said before , the space segment , ground segment and the user segment .
an in @-@ orbit satellite is not a loose kite . it has interactions with the ground .
we often send some data to the satellite from the ground stations to correct its devi@@ ations so that the entire system can be stabilized for long .
the GPS has plenty of ground stations in the world to ensure its global service .
as we extend the Be@@ id@@ ou to the entire world , we encountered the first obstacle in the way , that is , how to build overseas stations .
it is seemingly in@@ extr@@ icable in the short term to tackle such problems such as long @-@ period construction and difficulties in international coordination .
however , our researchers diverted their attention to the space .
it &apos;s uneasy to set up stations in other countries .
so why don &apos;t we transfer the function of those stations onto the satellites ?
so we built inter @-@ satellite links .
in a nut@@ shell , it &apos;s to open a channel between satellites to connect all of them .
and our Be@@ id@@ ou is capable of building a link as long as 50,000 ~ 70,000 km .
in this room , we can see each other and have eye contact . but an in @-@ orbit satellite , about two meters high , is 50,000 ~ 70,000 km away from another one in the vast space .
under such a circumstance , they are two spec@@ ks of dust .
but our inter @-@ satellite link technology made it come true .
so the two spec@@ ks of dust can capture , lock and send signals within 100 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds .
in this way , they can often interchange information of time and orbit .
without the ground support , our Be@@ id@@ ou system , a constellation based on inter @-@ satellite links , can maintain its autonomous operation through mutual calibration in a certain period .
that &apos;s the ability of autonomous navigation I am about to say .
of course , the system forms a network , which leaves plenty space for imagination .
in the near future , our Ti@@ ang@@ ong space station will also be fitted with such facilities , which will form an even bigger network in the space .
I have no idea how many IT engineers are present today , but they know it &apos;s impossible to fix all the bugs of software .
it &apos;s also applicable to the satellite research and manufacturing .
when we undertook the task , the deadline was set .
so we were not so assured that the satellites were perfect and would not malfunction in the space .
no , we were not .
normally , after a satellite is launched , its functions cannot be changed anymore .
but what if something goes wrong after the satellite is sent in the orbit ?
sorry , there is nothing we can do , because what has been done cannot be undone .
however , our Be@@ id@@ ou system realizes in @-@ orbit re@@ configuration .
what does in @-@ orbit re@@ configuration mean ?
except for firm@@ ware , others such as CPU , DSP and FP@@ GA can be re@@ configured .
every time when some new problems appear in the space , we can upload a new version to the satellites .
so the satellites upgrade its system and patch its faults .
so , this is the case when there are faults .
but when there are not , and our users have some new requirements , do we have to send another satellite into the space ?
with in @-@ orbit re@@ configuration , we don &apos;t have to .
we can get the new function realized , fully tested and verified on the ground , and then upload it to the satellites , just like installing a new AP@@ P on our satellites .
now , we all have smart phones , which give us endless imagination .
that is the in @-@ orbit empowerment of our software .
as I said before , the establishment of Be@@ id@@ ou attributes to myri@@ ads of people &apos;s dedication .
and I didn &apos;t even realize that we are in 20@@ 18 now .
on June 16 , 20@@ 16 , the State Council Information Office held a news conference to publish the white paper China &apos;s Bei@@ D@@ ou Navi@@ gation Satellite System , confirming our goal to establish Be@@ id@@ ou .
it includes our plan to launch 18 ME@@ O satellites in 20@@ 18 and the remaining 17 satellites by the end of 2020 to provide global services .
at that time , I thought the plan was far ahead , but now , we have rung in the year of 20@@ 18 .
on the basis of our Be@@ id@@ ou system in the space and the ground @-@ based aug@@ mentation system .
we are able to increase the positioning accuracy to a centi@@ meter level in regions , and a dec@@ imeter level in China and a meter level in the world .
let me give you an example .
on this picture , if the red line is our planned route , the traditional navigation , which is represented by the yellow line , often shows a path out of the road .
but such cases won &apos;t happen in the future , for we will have higher @-@ accuracy positioning .
China is an ancient country bo@@ asting a long history and agricultural civilization .
our ancestors worked for thousands of years from sunrise to sunset every day .
however , with a vast territory and abundant resources as well as complicated land@@ form .
it is hard to get agriculture modernized in our country .
its automation level is far behind the western developed countries .
but as the Be@@ id@@ ou system is established and gradually put into use , precision agriculture might be possible .
there &apos;s an image for you to imagine .
at daytime , the streets are loaded with endless stream of people and vehicles .
at night , the streets are tro@@ dden by cou@@ ri@@ ers that never need to get off work .
owing to our Be@@ id@@ ou system , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles carrying our parc@@ els work day in and day out .
so we may wake up in the morning to see our parc@@ els lie before us .
Be@@ id@@ ou , the city of sky , changes our life .
simply speaking , it improves our traffic conditions , our experience and our lifestyles .
from the legends of Chang E and Wan Hu to the ongoing Mars exploration program , humans have never given up their exploration of the universe in thousands of years .
here &apos;s an ad .
this is the Mic@@ ius , a quantum space satellite developed by the institute I work for .
and this is the Wu@@ kong , our dark matter particle explorer .
humans never ceased to explore the universe in the past , so will they in the future .
all of this being said , the Be@@ id@@ ou , while providing positioning , time service and navigation to our near @-@ earth users .
also serves as a space infrastructure of great significance for us humans to explore the un@@ fath@@ om@@ able ocean of stars .
thank you !
I &apos;ve been in the leadership consulting business for almost 20 years .
over the past 2 decades .
I have always believed that this industry would not change much .
why ?
because I think things like knowledge and the experience of a consultant are irreplaceable .
so I believe this is a pretty good job , and there should not be much change .
however , with the development of AI technology , all kinds of social AP@@ Ps , the computing technology , V@@ R technology , and the change of digital natives &quot; learning habits .
I realized that my business is being severely impacted .
because all the knowledge points , all the things that can be taught repeatedly , can really be taken over by AI and robots .
I was born in the 1970s .
can you imagine that as a post @-@ 7@@ 0s with educational background of psychology .
I am now with DD@@ I China , leading the digital transformation of the world ?
in this process , I do not think the hardest part is to find a direction or make a strategy , nor to learn to use the technology .
it does not take much time to learn that .
I think the hardest thing is to help people adjust their mindset and behavior , so that the business can embrace a new start .
I would like to tell everyone here that digit@@ alization is about more than just using AP@@ Ps that make your life easier .
as you can already see from the data on this slide .
China is at the heart of the digital storm .
according to the latest survey , more than 50 % of CEOs of China &apos;s top 1,000 companies have made digit@@ alization one of their most important strategies .
so , this has definitely influenced every business and everybody who works in the business .
let &apos;s take a look at what &apos;s keeping a CEO up at night .
CEO &apos;s top challenges .
what do 64 % of the CEOs worry about ?
in the new era , who can take my business to the next page ?
the second challenge .
what do 60 % of the CEOs worry about ?
top talents in all walks of life and top talents in all majors .
how do I retain them ?
and what less than 50 % of the CEOs fret about is what strategies to use to deal with the threats and competition posed by disruptive innovation .
you can see from the survey that CEOs believe that to embrace digital transformation , the most difficult and crucial part is talents .
so , this is what I &apos;m going to talk about today .
what is the person@@ a of the leaders in the new era and the future talents look like ?
before we get to the future person@@ a , I have to analyze the change of the job from two aspects first .
what is the impact of the job change on the role of the leader ?
then , we will move on to the unique quality that a leader should have .
we have just covered the first aspect of the change .
that is , the change of organizational structure of entre@@ prises .
more and more , we will need to shift from a bureaucratic structure or a functional structure to a matrix or network structure .
what does this mean for the leadership ?
it means de @-@ centr@@ alization and de @-@ authorization for the leadership .
therefore , leaders need more integration , more coordination and more influence to mobilize different people and mobilize the team to work together .
in addition , the pace of work is getting faster and faster .
at this rapid pace , leaders must make decisions quickly and decisively , and make rapid corrections .
therefore , there are higher requirements for the leaders &quot; ability of thinking and decision @-@ making .
the second aspect is the transformation of the teams we lead .
well , as the post @-@ 9@@ 0s and post @-@ 00@@ s enter the workplace .
they hope that they can make a difference .
they want their voices to be heard .
they want to do something meaningful .
they want leaders who are both teachers and friends .
this is a challenge to the leader who is expected to lead the team in different ways .
in addition , most of the labor @-@ related work in the future will be replaced by robots .
so the teams we lead will consist of intellectuals .
let us imagine that with all the intellectuals , the post @-@ 9@@ 0s and multiple teams working together .
how can we lead the team in a different way ?
how should we motivate and inspire them ?
I think this will become an important topic for the leaders .
the job of a leader has never been more important or more difficult .
let us take a look .
what is the definition of talents in the new era ?
according to the newly released results of the joint research conducted by DD@@ I and Er@@ n@@ st &amp; Young .
leaders in the new era should be equipped with five abilities , including 13 sub@@ divisions .
which are all very important in the future .
however , I think what is more important is that you should be able to integrate the resources , lead the team and inspire the members in the future .
I &apos;d like to tell you a story .
it is about a very famous conductor , Ric@@ car@@ do Mut@@ i .
why is he famous ?
because his performance is very special .
his performance is presented step by step , passionate and rigorous .
when you look at him conducting , you don &apos;t think he &apos;s enjoying the music .
it is more like that he is following a standard process step by step and in a fiery way .
so , one time , after he finished his performance .
a reporter asked him why did he conduct in this way ?
he said , &quot; That is how I make sure that it is fair to Mozart .
I need my orchestra to be very clear of my way .
I really needed them to know that this is how I would interpret a piece of music .
so that I would be worthy of Mozart . &quot;
perhaps you can imagine , after a while .
mut@@ i received a letter from 700 members of the orchestra .
the letter begins by saying , Mut@@ i .
we want you to resign because we don &apos;t want to work with you .
when we work with you .
we are just tools without souls .
let &apos;s take a look at another conductor who was actually very elegant and very famous , Carlos Kle@@ i@@ ber .
he was hailed as Kar@@ aj@@ an &apos;s first successor .
his performance was also very characteristic .
what was special about him ?
the characteristic of his performance was that he seemed to be drunk all the time .
he was very casual .
his emotions and expressions would always rise and fall with the music .
sometimes he even stopped , for he rev@@ elled in the music .
he just stopped conducting .
this way of conducting actually gives his orchestra a big room to improv@@ ise .
each team member needs to open their ears , listen to each other , develop good partnership and cooperation with each other , and complement each other .
so that they can present a very beautiful movement .
think about it .
in this internet era of detailed division of labor .
isn &apos;t a leader very much like a conductor ?
you have to get the best out of people in different disciplines .
but you should also be able to integrate all these talents .
so that they can produce the best results for the team .
this is the exact ability needed to integrate resources and mobilize people for a better development .
to me , this kind of ability is actually the most critical soft power to decide whether to win or to lose in the future .
OK , let us answer the next question .
many of you may ask , what we have just talked about is the abilities that leaders should have .
but I &apos;m not a leader , do I still need them ?
I would like to say that you can take a look at these qualities .
self @-@ learning , collaboration and resource integration are not just required by leaders .
in particular , when there is more and more team work in the future , anyone can be a leader .
so the abilities I just mentioned are actually necessary for everyone .
the future is an era in which everyone needs leadership skills .
how many people have that kind of skills ?
the answer is , only a few .
according to our latest global leadership outlook survey .
in China and the rest of the world , only less than 20 % of the current leaders believe they have the skills required for the future .
another data is about the fact that we invest a lot of time and money to develop leaders in enterprises .
but their abilities and qualities are only growing at a rate of less than 5 % per year .
people are developing very slowly .
so how can we solve the problem of talent shortage and slow development ?
we need to fully unle@@ ash everyone &apos;s potential .
you may ask , what is the relationship between releasing potential and culture ?
I would like to tell you another story .
I remember it vividly .
I was at the annual meeting of an enterprise where there was a hu@@ b@@ bu@@ b .
but when the moder@@ ator announced that the annual meeting would begin soon .
all the people immediately fell silent , without even a sound .
then you could see the president , in a beam of light , like what just saw , entered the place .
everyone stood up immediately at the same time , applauded , and shouted .
&quot; I love XX company &quot; and &quot; I love president XX ! &quot;
wow , I was thinking , I wanted that , too .
he must really enjoy it .
but think , if you think about it .
what is the culture that they are trying to convey ?
the culture it wants to convey is centered on &quot; me &quot; -- the top leader .
it is a top @-@ down architecture and you have to follow the orders .
we are a disciplined company .
think about it .
how can such a culture enable all employees to achieve their full potential ?
it is like the soil .
healthy soil can produce rich species .
the right corporate culture can also unle@@ ash the potential of your employees and make it a constant source of innovation for the company .
so , let us think about it .
how do we create the right corporate culture ?
the right corporate culture involves openness , empowerment , team building , agility , and innovation .
how do we cultivate this soil ?
we need a lot of nutrients .
what I am going to share with you include 6 + 1 nutrients .
how can we work together to create healthy soil ?
let &apos;s start with the structure .
in the future , the form of work would become more like a team , a matrix or network .
even there could be a formal organizational structure within entre@@ prises .
okay .
also , about creating the healthy soil through talent selecting .
we should pay special attention to the fact that if you want to build a diverse , co @-@ creating team culture .
you should not just focus on whether they have any experience in this field .
how many years of experience they have and what they have done in the past while recruiting people .
in fact , we need to create a multi @-@ faceted team more deliberately and pay attention to the multi @-@ faceted background .
let us move on to the next nutrition , promotion .
the same is true for promotion .
in the past , people were usually promoted according to a sen@@ iority system .
that is really something the Chinese would like to do .
however , if we want to build healthy soil that is open , em@@ powering and innovative in the future .
we need a system that allows us to see great people .
we need to get them promoted .
their ability should be more important than sen@@ iority .
let us move on to the next nutrition , development .
about development , particularly in recent years , as technology advances .
people have been advocating learning in many different ways including individu@@ alized learning and the combination of online and offline .
they are all good , but you should not forget the ultimate goal of development .
it &apos;s about changing people &apos;s behavior , right ?
we have mentioned at the very beginning the hardest part for a company to embrace a brand @-@ new start .
changes in people &apos;s behavior .
the ultimate mission of development will never change .
what we want to change is people &apos;s behavior .
so even though we can help people develop in a lot of different ways , with online and offline technologies .
we should design the whole experience and the whole path with the goal in mind , with behavior changes in mind .
that &apos;s what we can &apos;t forget .
last but not least , I &apos;ll leave the most important for last .
I think performance and reward are the two most important ingredients in building the culture .
okay , let us talk about performance first .
I &apos;ve always hated performance assessment and performance management , even performance review .
listen to this name , does it sound em@@ powering ?
do you think it reflects any team spirit ?
no .
it &apos;s just a typical top @-@ down concept .
so honestly , I do not like these names .
but if you think about it , performance , what is that for ?
to create performance .
is the purpose of the system itself to create performance ?
right ?
I think the performance system lacks some elements and some spirit in its design .
first of all , how to improve the top @-@ down K@@ P@@ Is and give your employees some space to make decisions for themselves ?
so that they can follow the direction of the company , be a part of the corporate culture , and be clear about how to deal with the work .
you should just let them enjoy some autonomy .
there is something I do not believe .
I agree that it is important to set the goal .
but I don &apos;t believe from the bottom of my heart that anything has to be quanti@@ fied .
there are a lot of things you can &apos;t quantify , right ?
for example .
you went to experiment with innovation today and you examined 100 projects .
only 2 of them were successful and the other 98 failed .
how do you measure this with K@@ PI ?
while designing the performance system .
I think it is very important that you give the autonomy to your employees and let all the leaders encourage them to use the autonomy .
what is more , is there timely feedback and discussion in this process ?
since the goal is to create performance , you cannot just discuss with your leader .
there should be discussions among all the team members to solve the problems .
so that you can get the performance you expect , reach your goals and complete your tasks .
I think this is the key .
the design of the performance system involves both the behavior and the result .
I think we have attached too much importance to the result , without enough attention to the behavior .
why is behavior important ?
do those 98 unsuccessful projects mean that the people on those 98 teams perform poorly ?
not necessarily !
but if you don &apos;t measure it by results .
what do you do ?
you can measure their behaviors in the process .
does their behaviors show innovation ?
were they agile in the process ?
what about the teamwork in the process ?
it &apos;s all measurable .
I am convinced that behavior is the most important leading indicator of results .
finally , Performance will always be linked to the reward system .
about the reward system , I have only one thing to remind you .
past rewards have been more individu@@ alistic .
those who have saved the most , reached the performance goal and those who have achieved the best results , get bonuses , or dividends .
but as we said , if there is more team work in the future .
the reward system has to break down the individual hero@@ ism .
you need the right team rewards to cultivate the team atmosphere you want .
the 6 nutrients are put forward from the institutional perspective .
with which we can create soil that is healthier and more productive .
the last extra nutrient , and the most important nutrient , is leading by example .
all corporate cultures must flow from the top down like a waterfall .
so that employees &quot; potential can be unleashed from the bottom up like a hot spring .
if a leader can integrate , create , empower , em@@ path@@ ize and mobilize people .
as I just mentioned , he can definitely cultivate a very healthy soil to release the potential of all his employees .
the last thing I would like to share with you is that I have a very profound feeling .
and I have seen for many years that failing companies are often over @-@ managed and under @-@ led .
hello everyone ! my name is Chen Shu@@ o .
I would like to share a very intriguing story with you today .
when Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u sent me an invitation .
I asked myself why not share a story about &quot; innovation . &quot;
what is &quot; innovation &quot; ?
if we are not pleased or content with traditions and conventions .
we innovate new ways to replace them .
the story I am going to share with you today is about a small science and technology team which innov@@ ated a new urban pattern as it was unhappy about the traditional city with high emission and serious pollution .
the screen on the back presents you our latest work .
at somewhere 20 km away from Hangzhou , lying on An@@ ji .
we built the first zero @-@ carbon @-@ emission resort in China .
what is a zero @-@ carbon @-@ emission resort like ?
we can answer the question from two aspects .
on the one hand , in terms of operation , the complex is powered by solar energy .
all the water is supplied by rain , and waste is completely disposed by bio@@ degradation and micro @-@ biological degradation .
yet , our ambition was far beyond to build a carbon @-@ free planet model .
we also wanted to gro@@ pe for a new way to build homes where future people live .
why would future homes have to be built in the traditional way with steel and concrete ?
would they have to be box@@ y ?
with the ambition , we constructed the first carbon @-@ free planets .
the plant is totally different from the ubiquitous design of homes and hotels .
it is a three @-@ floor globe .
this picture shows the third floor .
on the roof , there are open sky@@ lights , which are the entrance for dr@@ ones .
meanwhile , we hoped to integrate future lifestyle with future and current aesthetics so as to develop a building featuring design , technology as well as future art .
we even hoped the buildings to present different appearances .
as for security , dr@@ ones are expected to take the place of the personnel to patrol the complex .
thus , among the green mountains and clear waters .
we could construct an incredible complex with an incredible way .
and here came a very interesting question .
would we have to live in high @-@ density cities like Shanghai in the future , struggling to get on the subway every day ?
or , we would live in small towns which highlight extremely eco @-@ friendly and environment @-@ friendly lifestyle .
our restaurants would offer more green food in a more green way .
which represents a kind of future lifestyle .
even more , robots might replace some wait@@ ers and wait@@ resses .
everything I talked above is to discuss the innovations of construction patterns and urban patterns which haven &apos;t changed for thousands of years .
and here comes the first question .
five thousand years ago , Egyptians built pyramids with concrete .
do we still rely on concrete to build houses today ?
or , maybe we can try carbon fiber .
OK , everyone knows that carbon fiber is so far the best artificial material throughout history .
traditionally , carbon fiber is only used to manufacture advanced products and devices .
such as the most expensive lim@@ ous@@ ines and yach@@ ts , high @-@ speed trains , rockets and the best cel@@ los .
can we use the material to build houses ?
this was the first thing we prob@@ ed .
if we can do that .
we are able to make carbon fiber four times as strong as steel .
furthermore , as you can see .
the casting of traditional houses is 4@@ 00@@ mm thick ,
while the thickness can be decreased to 4@@ mm if we adopt carbon fiber to build houses .
as carbon fiber is the best material in the wor@@ ls .
it owns the unprecedented fire@@ proofing , heat preservation quality and gas ti@@ ghtness .
carbon fiber would be the only choice when we are going to build houses on the moon and the Mars .
the two pictures on the right show the first carbon @-@ fiber house in the world which was built by us .
how was such a house exactly built ?
to answer the question , I need to brief you on the forming process of carbon fiber .
what is the traditional way to build a house like that ?
the traditional way is very simple .
workers carry steel and cement to the site to concrete a house .
then place steel columns into the building .
it is not going to work if carbon fiber is adopted .
if we want to make a carbon @-@ fiber plate .
we need a mould which is bigger than the plate .
then we put carbon fiber onto the mould .
using vacuum and chemical reaction , the material can be shaped into a plate .
so do we need a mould which is larger than a house to build a house ?
how could we make a mould which is even larger than a house ?
hence , we had our second funny question .
do we have to make things with bigger moul@@ ds ?
and do we have to make things with harder moul@@ ds ?
traditionally , the answer is yes .
we need iron mould to make porcelain .
we need probably diamond mould to make iron objects .
what can be used as the mould for a building ?
we over@@ turned the tradition .
we employed air which is the sof@@ test , the most flexible , the lightest and the most ubiquitous thing in the world as the mould .
how did we achieve it ?
we shaped carbon fiber into balloons .
then we used air and the PVC material with high elastic modulus to make moul@@ ds .
the construction was completed when the balloons were blown up at the site .
it took just 20 minutes . no workers , steel or cement were needed .
it is an innovation of great significance in the industry .
using the sof@@ test thing to build the hardest thing , using the smallest to build the largest .
now that we have the best building material in the industry .
we have created a formula for the blending of resin and carbon fiber .
what furniture would we use if we lived in such a spacious carbon @-@ fiber house one day ?
this was how we started our third journey .
we established the first carbon @-@ fiber furniture manufacturer in China .
we didn &apos;t think we would manufacture ordinary wooden furniture which consists of pillars and boards with the hardest and the lightest materials in the world .
we might design a new table whose surface could curve continuously .
or , the table could turn into a basin or a fruit tray which show@@ cases brand new lifestyle , design ideas and experience .
or , we could make a tea table which combines fruit tray , book@@ case and others .
all of the designs could take the lead .
though all of these seem impossible with regard to the traditional construction history .
we could make them all happen with carbon fiber .
so our third story is about the independent furniture career and design career we developed for carbon fiber .
we aimed to introduce carbon @-@ fiber products to everyone &apos;s life .
in the end , however , translating the thought into practice requires a mould for carbon fiber .
is it possible that we manufacture various sophisticated carbon @-@ fiber products .
such as phones and cameras , without moul@@ ds ?
how can we realize that ?
we need the help of electron .
OK , you all know that factories and workers are necessary to manufacture everything .
but is it possible that we remove nucleus from molecule and employ the separated electrons to manufacture products ?
this involved the Vac@@ u@@ um Electric Rec@@ ent Acc@@ um@@ ulation System ( V@@ era System for short ) we explored at the fourth journey .
we realized that mould is necessary for traditional manufacture .
if we bombar@@ ded resin with electron beams .
each electron beam could solidi@@ fy about 10 nan@@ ometers resin .
then a very precise carbon fiber formed .
10 nan@@ ometers resin means all the molecules are re@@ arranged .
in this way , the manufacture process could be done in a very short time .
it takes one second to bomb@@ ard 30 layers of resin .
1 minute to bomb@@ ard 1,800 layers .
the E@@ i@@ ff@@ el Tower could be built from a plate of 1@@ mm @-@ thick resin in this way without further process .
the V@@ era System allows us to make unpreced@@ ent@@ edly strong products within an extremely short time .
at the same time , the quality of the products will be rather high and the weight will be extremely light .
also , the surface scratch resistance will be good .
hence , the products could be used in not only furniture but also the highly precise turbine blades of aircraft and the jet engine of spac@@ ec@@ rafts .
through practice .
we gradually changed the details of buildings .
I just talked about the innovation about buildings , furniture , the moul@@ ding model of furniture and 3D print .
but what does the &quot; carbon @-@ free &quot; of carbon @-@ free planet stand for ?
it is a radical innovative urban design which is distinctive from the traditional one .
modern cities are powered by the thermal power plant hundreds of kilometers away via high tension electricity .
in terms of physics , energy is conserv@@ ed .
because of heat island effect , electricity turns to heat at night@@ fall .
every morning , hundreds of kilometers away from cities .
water@@ works use chloride to produce tap water and supply it to cities .
because of the conservation of matter , all the water turns into sewage in the evening .
water doesn &apos;t disappear , so every kilogram tap water turns into a kilogram sewage .
every morning , cities take in plenty of food and commodities from a distant place .
now that matter is conserv@@ ed , garbage , wast@@ age , fa@@ eces , sewage and pollution of the same weight are produced at dusk .
this is a city .
a one @-@ way disposal system .
it takes resources every day and discharge waste heat and wast@@ age of the same amount of energy to pollute the nature .
what should we do if we are not pleased about it ?
we take action .
we build a new city .
the new city may entirely rely on solar energy to generate power and rain to get water supply .
by virtue of reverse os@@ mos@@ is membrane and ultr@@ af@@ il@@ tration membrane .
all wast@@ age can be disposed by bio@@ degradation or on its own .
these are the innovations we made for urban design .
and the innovations represent different innovative urban models and bring considerable economic value .
our fifth goal is to get rid of power plant in the carbon @-@ free planet resort .
if a carbon @-@ free planet can generate power from wind , solar energy and biodi@@ esel and employs an accum@@ ulator to dispose electricity .
the carbon @-@ free planet would need no other power which causes pollution .
our sixth attempt is to get rid of traditional sewage treatment plants and water@@ works .
traditionally , a resort needs a large scale of water pipes , sewage condu@@ its and pumps .
but if we turn to the most eco @-@ friendly way rather than the traditional one .
we dispose the sewage through artificial wetland .
then we collect rain .
which will be disposed by reverse os@@ mos@@ is membrane and ultr@@ af@@ il@@ tration membrane .
we could turn the environment and nature into our natural sewage treatment plant and water@@ works .
additionally , the water quality is far better than that of the water purified by chloride and sedimentation .
maybe human civilization develops in a round@@ about way .
we employed a lot of technology to develop city @-@ scale urban sewage treatment plants and waste disposal station .
but in fact , we can dispose sewage with the environment , as well as get water supply from the ecosystem .
and the cost would decrease to less than one third of the current cost .
this is the future we look forward to .
these are the innovations we made because we are not satisfied with current high @-@ emission cities .
there is one more thing we dislike , the traffic jam .
the traffic in Shanghai is terrible every day , isn &apos;t it ?
everyday Shanghai sees heavy traffic jam .
probably , our thought about roads is wrong .
the current road design is based on the experience of hundreds of human drivers which are lab@@ ile factors driving on the same road .
in the next era .
if all vehicles were driven by AI , a one @-@ line road could be enough .
the traffic volume would be infinite as AI would keep driving .
so we developed our eighth system .
the autonomous driving system .
in our resort .
we invested money in a one @-@ lane road rather than four @-@ lane or eight @-@ lane concrete roads .
we saved more than tens of millions of RMB and invested the money in autonomous driving vehicles like this .
also , we manufactured the vehicles with the saved money .
what happened then ?
we saved nearly tens of millions of RMB and spent only millions of RMB on the vehicles .
hence , it could bring great economic benefits .
also , our future lifestyle and life experience will be changed greatly .
these are the innovations we have done and the challenges we have made to change traditional cities and lifestyle .
we hope the pragmatic innovations could make a difference and change the unpleasant urban life and low @-@ efficiency lifestyle .
to do is more than to complain .
this is what I want to share with you today - make something new when you are unhappy about the existing ones .
let &apos;s create a low @-@ carbon , high @-@ efficiency and high @-@ quality future !
thank you !
hello ! I &apos;m one of the partners of Q@@ im@@ ing Venture Partners .
today I am very happy to share with you some of my investment experience in new retail .
first of all , I want to famili@@ arize you with the concept of New Ret@@ ail .
and why it was proposed ?
new Ret@@ ail was actually first put forward by Jack Ma of Ali@@ baba .
but why Ali@@ baba was the first one to notice the trend ?
because e @-@ commerce , after decades of development .
has actually begun to undergo slower growth .
well , the 20@@ 16 statistics shows the growth of e @-@ commerce decreased to 24 % .
in fact , the penetration rate of e @-@ commerce is about 15 % , and 85 % of the retail is actually done offline .
that &apos;s why Jack Ma is very anxious to invest in the offline retail or consumption .
offline retailers are also very envious of their online peers .
because as you probably know , offline retail has been badly hit by online retail .
from September to November in 20@@ 16 .
the top 100 retailers grew by only 0.6 % .
in fact , many department stores , including big stores , have also suffered from similar stagnation .
the US has also witnessed a stream of clos@@ ings that has never been seen in the past 20 years .
so the new retail is born .
but what should we do ?
and now I want to share my views on the new retail .
first , we may have to consider how to develop a new business format .
to achieve this purpose , we have to first fam@@ ali@@ ri@@ ze ourselves with the whole purchasing process in retail .
the first step may be that customers start to learn about the retailer or product .
next , the customers may be attracted to the product .
thirdly , they place the order and pay for it and then they receive the order .
and if it is e @-@ commerce .
there is also logistics and delivery .
and the final step is after @-@ sales service .
so compared with online retail .
offline retail is less efficient .
because offline retail generally has a layered distribution system .
where the price of a commodity may climb to between five and ten times of the original price .
and the logistics is not optimized .
however , the most terrible thing is their poor understanding about customer behavior .
I talked with an owner of a chain convenience store .
he told me that he had the slightest idea about who bought something and what they bought today .
and who would come to his store tomorrow ?
his biggest concern is what to purchase today .
but in the online scenario , the entire process is digit@@ alized .
that is to say , I can keep track of the number of traffic today and gain a relatively accurate customer profile .
like what goods this customer clicks , what he has put in the collection box and what he has bought .
the entire process is transparent .
but how to integrate online and offline ?
some offline retailers reconstruct an online process and move some of the SK@@ Us or goods online .
but this strategy is actually a huge burden to them and fails to deliver desirable , maximum results .
so you may ask about how to make the integration ?
how to improve customer experience ?
because the strong suit of offline retailing lies in the customer experience .
H@@ EM@@ A F@@ resh is a good example of the online and offline integration .
I think that as venture capital firms .
we used to observe the fresh food e @-@ commerce and for so many years .
we have refr@@ ained from investing in the fresh e @-@ commerce .
why it that ?
e @-@ commerce focused on fresh foods has two features .
high risks of damage or loss to the goods , and the high fulfilment cost .
that is to say , you may have to build the entire cold chain logistics system to do the business .
but how does H@@ ema cope with the problems ?
there are two interesting tactics .
first , H@@ ema would reduce the damage or loss to seafood , one major product , periodically by offering on @-@ site catering , and thus reduce the cost .
the other strategy is that the stores serve the dual purposes of an online retailer and a warehouse .
this way .
H@@ EM@@ A doesn &apos;t have to use cold @-@ chain logistics to deliver the goods and it thus reduces the fulfilment cost .
therefore , I think that H@@ ema F@@ resh is quite competitive in this field .
and it has done things previous fresh food e @-@ commerce couldn &apos;t do before .
but this industry is not very suitable for investors to enter because it requires a high investment , and with high operation costs , it is also relatively difficult to operate .
let &apos;s take a look at the new technologies , including the payment technology .
I wonder if you have heard of Amazon Go .
Amazon Go has actually pushed the technology to the extremes to transform the entire retail sector .
it is a retail business format that involves no cas@@ hi@@ ers , no lin@@ eup and no check@@ out .
shoppers can take the goods away as they pay .
as you enter the store .
you just need to swi@@ pe your mobile phone to show your identity .
this is the app that scans your Amazon account and keeps track of your shopping behavior on Amazon .
and in the store .
you can choose the products and take them as you leave .
this is a shopping behaviour of huge innovation .
why did Amazon do it ?
I think Amazon is the first e @-@ commerce giant to achieve the one @-@ click function .
that is to place order and check out with just one click .
so it intended to bring that experience offline .
but how ?
then came the Take Go .
but what &apos;s the technology behind ?
as you can see .
there are a lot of cameras and sensors attached to it .
including weight sensors .
so it can not only identify the goods .
but what goods you take , and who takes it .
if the two of us stand by the same shelf and take the same goods .
it can tell which of us takes it .
so I think technology can help to digit@@ alize the entire shopping experience in retail and transform the retail industry for the better .
well , the industry can probably be transformed in the following aspects .
the first area may be to predict customer demands I mentioned earlier .
that is , whether you can effectively predict who will come to the store and what will they buy today .
and how many people will buy the same things tomorrow .
or whether you should purchase new products .
there have been a lot of technological breakthroughs .
including the cameras , sensors , cloud services and so on , and these technologies have a low cost .
the second aspect is the warehouse , logistics and distribution .
can they be optimized ?
for example .
if I can see how many people put the product in the basket .
then can the goods be automatically replen@@ ished in my warehouse ?
another example is marketing .
is it possible for us to draw on the BI analytical software , big data and AI to analyze and constantly learn the needs of customers ?
is it possible for us to know whether the customers like the products we recommend to them ?
for example .
young people are a big fan of anim@@ ations , cartoons or games .
if a young people comes to the store .
I think he will probably like the package of anim@@ ations , cartoons or games .
so can we recommend to him something like the model of a character in anim@@ ations , cartoons or games ?
the third aspect is the new scenario .
can we be any closer to the customer ?
for example , in a community .
you may say we tend to divide a day into three portions of eight hours .
during the first eight hours , we may stay at home in the community .
and in the next eight hours , we may work in the office and we will sleep through the final 8 hours .
and on weekends , the time originally devoted to the office may be spent in the mall .
so I wonder whether you intend to grasp the traffic of the community , the office , or the vacancies in the mall .
and then adopt a new mode of rapid expansion .
a big problem in traditional retail is the location .
once you choose the wrong location , the mall will not work , and for various reasons .
it will suffer from bad operations .
then can we try at a lower cost ?
can we move the store if it attracts few customers ?
these are some of the new business models .
let &apos;s return to the community scenario .
I have invested in an un@@ staffed convenience store called the Bing@@ o .
many people say that convenience stores save nothing but labor costs .
but labor costs are just a small part .
but this is not the case .
just as the founder of Bing@@ o said , it is not that the unmanned convenience store is convenient because it is un@@ staffed , but it is convenient so it is un@@ staffed .
what he targets at is the scenario we talk about , for example the community scenario .
in this scenario .
there is often not enough traffic to support a convenience store .
in the case of Bing@@ o , there is no staff so we have no labor costs .
second , the cost of the box is very low because we don &apos;t have to worry about the high depreciation and renovation costs .
and thirdly , the rent is relatively cheaper because we cooperate with the property management company .
by reducing all these costs .
we can maintain healthy operations in the community .
then some may ask how such un@@ staffed convenience stores are different from ven@@ ding machines ?
and what makes them different from the mom @-@ and @-@ pop stores ?
well , we have a wider range of SK@@ Us or goods than the ven@@ ding machines .
and the goods is of better quality than that in the mom @-@ and @-@ pop stores .
and what makes them different from traditional convenience stores ?
we are very close to the customers , zero distance .
another scenario is the office .
if you come to some of the star@@ tu@@ ps .
you may find such an unmanned shelf at the reception or in their kitchen .
the unmanned shelf is a new business format that was popular in the VC industry last year .
basically , customers or consumers scan the code and pay for the goods , generally drinks and snacks .
although the model is very simple , it still attracts a lot of investors and VC firms .
mainly because we all see the offline traffic of the new scene .
we also notice the ven@@ ding machines .
as we all know .
ven@@ ding machines are not a new phenomenon .
You@@ b@@ ao was prof@@ itably engaged in ven@@ ding machine business for a long time .
and then there are new versions of ven@@ ding machines .
for example , the Fan Me@@ im@@ ei ven@@ ding machine sells packed meals and it allows you to directly heat the meals in the lobby .
it could be totally un@@ planned .
and the An@@ gle &apos;s O@@ range ven@@ ding machine sells freshly @-@ made orange juice and it allows people to enjoy fresh juice .
what &apos;s better , the two ven@@ ding machine operators make profits with high unit prices .
so I want to sum up the three different models of new retail .
the large supermarket like H@@ ema F@@ resh .
the unmanned convenience store , and the unmanned shelf and the ven@@ ding machine in office .
another interesting case I want to mention is M@@ i Family owned by Xia@@ om@@ i .
as we all know .
Xia@@ om@@ i &apos;s hardware is of good quality , especially its mobile phones , but apart from hardware .
it is also performs well in new retail .
I listened to Xiao M@@ i &apos;s conference yesterday .
Xiao M@@ i has ranked second globally in its sales of cell@@ phones , following Apple .
the second place is due to its cost control .
Xiao M@@ i can keep a consistent operation cost in online retail .
which is highly remarkable .
however , Xiao M@@ i actually has a profitable tri@@ o model .
and the most profitable is its Internet services .
including its cloud service , games , contents and so on .
so when you venture into the battlefield of new retail .
you may have to know in what aspects you &apos;re competing with your rivals .
Xia@@ om@@ i is a very interesting case .
it performs quite well in new retail but new retail may be not its most profitable business .
I want to summarize my understandings of new retail .
as far as I think , firstly we have realized that the online traffic dividend is declining .
and we begin to turn our attention to the the valuable mine of offline business .
but we have to think clearly how to dig the offline mine .
well , we can draw on technologies , or try new scenes , or try to improve offline experience .
however , new retail is still an under @-@ explored industry .
it is indeed a new field and everyone is exploring it .
my second understanding is to attract customers .
many people say we must attract customers offline now .
but that is only the first step .
more importantly , we have to consider how to improve efficiency and make a better supply chain .
and whether we can transform ware@@ housing , logistics , distribution and so on with AI technology .
and the final step is to ensure a good customer experience .
including precision marketing and a seamless experience .
in the end , I &apos;d like to respond to those people who have asked me whether the unmanned Bing@@ o store will replace a lot of cas@@ hi@@ ers and render them jobless .
once , our founder described a future vision where in a mom @-@ and @-@ pop store .
the owner can manage ten stores or even twenty stores on his mobile phone .
because with the remote data , all the purchases , the anti @-@ theft system and the management can be done very well .
don &apos;t you think this is a good vision ?
well , that &apos;s all I have to say about the new retail .
thank you !
I am now working in a very mature , highly systematic corporation as an innovation manager .
my job is to make the corporation &apos;s strategies and business more innovation @-@ oriented .
as an industry develops , people from different backgrounds may propose to advance innovation from different angles .
for example , a financial mind or a mind used to strategic analysis will naturally focus on the business model and profitability .
a technical or operational mind will , however , care more about the feasibility of a technology or the stability of a system .
but there is also a group of people who might revol@@ ve around the experience and demand of the customers .
that line of thinking which views the customer demand as the core .
is actually becoming more and more popular today , and is increasingly ev@@ oking empathy .
but it &apos;s en@@ countering tougher obstacles in large corporations .
why is that ?
the reason is that large corporations prefer to depend on quanti@@ fiable figures when they are making decisions .
one difference between large corporations and star@@ tu@@ ps is that .
star@@ tu@@ ps , whenever they spot a potential demand from the customers .
however small and confined that demand might look , will just take actions .
but in a large corporation .
if you want to do something , you have to first persuade people from different backgrounds to agree with you .
that &apos;s just tough .
so in a large corporation , we might analyze the innovation risks in a more systematic manner when we are promoting something new .
we &apos;ll think more about the risks brought to the entire enterprise ecosystem .
so what does the word &quot; ecosystem risks of innovation &quot; mean here ?
it maj@@ or@@ ly includes three kinds of risks , which I &apos;ve listed on the screen .
firstly , the initiative risks , or more specifically speaking , the project management risks .
as a relatively basic kind of risk , a management risk means that a product or project manager might not be able to arrange things - like allocating the right people the right tasks - in an efficient way .
and thus fail to follow the timetable and finally cause a delayed delivery .
it is a risk of project management .
it involves po@@ oling resources within a corporation and requires the project management skills .
but the other two innovation risks might go beyond the project .
in other words , it might go beyond the control of the project managers .
these two risks , if neglected , might deal a lethal blow to the innovation project .
so the first one is called interdependence risks .
what is it ?
in Chinese , we call it &quot; 互@@ 赖@@ 性@@ 风@@ 险 . &quot;
what do you mean by &quot; interdependence &quot; ?
after all some innovation projects can never be implemented without being complemented by certain factors .
take smart home devices for example .
they will never work if there is not a perfect Wi@@ Fi connection , right ?
and the smart light bulbs .
they are basically inserted into only one , rather than many a , lamp holder .
the problem here is .
the light bulb in a single lamp holder can &apos;t make our living room bright enough .
so far no solution has been given to it . why ?
because the Wi@@ Fi just can &apos;t support so many lamp holders at a time .
another example is that , a company once pil@@ oted a mobile PM@@ 2.5 monitoring solution that allowed cell@@ phones to monitor PM@@ 2.5 directly .
but the solution never had a chance to be widely used .
so what was the problem ?
the reason was that the tiny chip for PM@@ 2.5 monitoring must be embedded into the cellphone chip .
and moreover , it must be accurate and practically instructive .
obviously our sensor technology was not that ready .
now you might know more about the interdependence risks .
the word means that you might find the conditions are not so ready for something you plan .
suppose , the upstream of the supply chain is ready , and you have finally developed a product and added it to the corporation &apos;s portfolio , it is ready to be sold .
but it &apos;s still a long way away from the consumers .
you have to correctly estimate how long that interval is .
the risk lying here is called the integration risk .
you may also call it &quot; channel risk . &quot;
five to six years ago , there was a spl@@ ash@@ y Silicon Valley entrepreneurship project named qu@@ ir@@ ky .
its story sounds like an exemplary legend .
its founder , Ben K@@ au@@ f@@ mann , started his own business even when he was in high school .
by the time he entered university .
he had become a very experienced entrepreneur .
he always hoped that one day he could transform all the creative ideas in the world into a reality .
so he sought people &apos;s help and launched an online community to gather all the creative ideas its users might have in daily life .
you see , he did a really good job in crow@@ d@@ sourcing the task of digging into the consumers &apos; needs .
creative ideas popped up every day .
for example , someone would post an ingenious idea as to how to separate egg whites from yol@@ ks .
and Ben K@@ au@@ f@@ mann would , assisted by the already @-@ existing appraisal system in his own company .
select 20 best ideas every week from the massive online idea base .
then qu@@ ir@@ ky would invite engineers and product designers to together turn those ideas into realities .
some of them even became real products that could be sold in retail outlets .
doesn &apos;t that idea sound nice to you ?
but if we look closely .
we might find that this idea also had a problem .
it saw its best days .
or rather , swept its way , between 2011 and 20@@ 13 .
back then not many people were shopping on line .
qu@@ ir@@ ky &apos;s products generally went to traditional home appliance and furniture retail outlets like Best Buy , or Tar@@ get .
the problem of qu@@ ir@@ ky was , it was always changing its theme .
that made it even harder for retailers to spell out the ideas behind qu@@ ir@@ ky &apos;s products to the customers .
as you know , in traditional retail , in general , it has several core SK@@ Us , but it has created most of the profits .
but what qu@@ ir@@ ky did was quite the opposite .
because how many products it produces at one time , and then after it is put into use , the next time because new ideas come in , a new , er , SK@@ U will be put on the shelf .
that was where contradictions would arise .
and no traditional retail outlet was able to effectively spell out qu@@ ir@@ ky &apos;s ideas .
so its product , in fact , has not been profitable .
as time went on , the traditional retail outlets began to cast off most of qu@@ ir@@ ky &apos;s SK@@ Us .
the most successful qu@@ ir@@ ky product was perhaps a de@@ form@@ able , b@@ endable socket named &quot; Pi@@ v@@ ot . &quot;
simply put , qu@@ ir@@ ky encountered an integration risk .
it rolled out products even when there was not a sales network for them .
that made qu@@ ir@@ ky an alien in traditional retail business .
now let &apos;s take a look at the upstream part of qu@@ ir@@ ky &apos;s supply chain and analyze its interdependence risks .
you should know that the SK@@ Us produced every day by qu@@ ir@@ ky &apos;s platform were very diverse in kind .
they could fall into any category , such as furniture , or electronic products .
that means qu@@ ir@@ ky &apos;s manufacturing partners must also span various sectors .
many of qu@@ ir@@ ky &apos;s manufacturing partners were from China and that reduced the cost .
but the long distance itself was actually also an obstacle .
in September , 2015 , qu@@ ir@@ ky , which was founded in 2009 , declared bankruptcy .
that was heart @-@ w@@ ren@@ ching news to many people , for it was really a very creative platform .
but unfortunately , it had come to a dead end .
in truth , now when we evaluate an innovation strategy .
we have begun to pay more and more attention to why the ecosystem risks of innovation will harm our innovation .
and after we have said so much about the ecosystem risks .
we should know that , only with good preparation can a good idea be turned into a successful business .
that &apos;s why we always say &quot; Ide@@ as are cheap , if you cannot make them real . &quot;
you might have heard of Eve@@ rett Rog@@ ers , an economist who used two curves to show how a new idea generally re@@ aps commercial returns .
according to him , the most difficult step is to cross the huge gul@@ ly between the early adop@@ ters and the majority .
picture this .
suppose I am an early user of some smart home device .
though the product is still at its immature stage , I choose it , because I am interested in it .
but most of my friends perhaps would never choose it .
they are the majority .
how can the product also reach my friends ?
this huge gul@@ ly between early adop@@ ters like me and my friends might end up as a grave for many innov@@ ators .
it would be very hard to cross the gul@@ ly unless the product or service has some very reliable strengths .
so here is what Eve@@ rett Rog@@ ers did .
he proposed the AC@@ C@@ OR@@ D Model , which summed up all the conditions that must be met before any new product or technology can be widely adopted .
accord is an acr@@ onym for six different standards .
with these six standards at hand , we can then compare and see whether our products meet them .
that &apos;s also what I usually do for a prudent examination when I manage an innovation project .
let &apos;s see the six standards one by one .
the first one is advantage to what it replaces .
that is for sure .
the new product or service must have some unique strengths .
second , compatibility with customers &apos; environment .
let me give you an example .
since all of us now are using the same internet protocol .
any new service had better be compatible with the protocol , or else the innovation might incur huge costs .
the third standard is no complexity in understanding , installation or use .
in other words , the new product or service must be simple and barrier @-@ free to customers .
it must comply with current behaviors and habits of both machine and people .
the fourth standard is observ@@ ability of product benefits .
the benefits must be very obvious and easily discer@@ ned by customers .
the fifth is risk of product failure : what risks might there be if I adopt the new product ?
and the last standard is div@@ isibility : how it can be tried on a limited basis .
I have an entrepreneur friend , who once planned to provide value @-@ added services for those infer@@ tile people .
he found himself wavering between two options : should he roll out a full package of services first ?
or should he promote the core check@@ up services first and let customers experience them for real ?
opinions were diverse in his team .
if he could apply the AC@@ C@@ OR@@ D Model to his problem , things might become much easier for him .
suppose the entire package of medical consultations and services is priced at 30,000 RMB .
if you first promote the core services , customers will instantly feel their value .
for example , you can use as an ovarian aging test as a bait .
that might cost 3000 RMB .
which of the two , the 30,000 RMB or the 3,000 RMB , can help you win over early adop@@ ters more easily ?
it is a good example of div@@ isibility .
the more divisible your product or service is , the more modules of services there can be to be experienced .
you may communicate to the customers the value of the full package by first letting them experience part of it with a low cost .
in that way you will be observed by the customers as a new choice .
that will be a very good start for you .
to sum up , when we have a new idea .
we must first en@@ vision it with an open mind , analyze the upstream and downstream parts of its supply chain , and find what is missing there .
in this process we may also learn why some very good ideas cannot benefit both customers and businesses .
benefit both the customers and the businesses . that &apos;s the standard I would use to define innovation .
thank you !
hi !
I &apos;m Qi@@ u Z@@ il@@ ong , and I &apos;m from the Shanghai Institute of Neuro@@ science , Chinese Academy of Sciences .
so , for the next half hour , let &apos;s talk about autism .
when it comes to autism , do you think all the people with autism are little gen@@ i@@ uses ?
what do you think an au@@ ti@@ stic child looks like ?
let &apos;s first look at how people have come to understand autism in the history of science and medicine .
in 19@@ 43 , Leo Ken@@ ner , an American pedi@@ atric@@ ian and psychiatrist , defined autism for the first time .
he found that there were 11 children who had severe repetitive behaviors and were unable to communicate with others .
since then , autism has entered the field of human psychiat@@ ry as a separate topic .
what happened to the 11 children ?
I will tell you at the end of the speech .
with the medical definition of autism , many people think that all these patients are gen@@ i@@ uses .
well , not really .
this is a coordinate system .
on the horizontal axis represents the severity of autism , and on the vertical axis is the level of intelligence .
every au@@ ti@@ stic child falls into a quad@@ rant , he or she may have high @-@ functioning autism , generalized disorder , or the well @-@ known As@@ per@@ ger &apos;s Syndrome .
speaking of As@@ per@@ ger &apos;s Syndrome , we have to mention a very famous doctor , Hans As@@ per@@ ger .
he was an Austrian pedi@@ atric@@ ian and psychiatrist at University of Vienna .
in the 1930s , he found that some kids were extremely intelligent , but they didn &apos;t like to communicate with other people .
he observed these children up close and called them little professors .
Dr. As@@ per@@ ger recorded his findings in German .
unfortunately , his records were destroyed in World War II .
the materials were re@@ discovered in the 1960s , and the disorder was then named As@@ per@@ ger &apos;s Syndrome .
but there are questions to answer .
why has Dr. As@@ per@@ ger never reported on children with intellectual disabilities ?
as we know that not every child with autism is a genius .
why are they never reported ?
after research , historians found some clue .
what was Austria like in 1930s ?
it was actually annexed by Nazi Germany after 19@@ 35 .
at that time , Austria and Germany were pursuing what Hitler called &quot; positive eu@@ gen@@ ics . &quot;
it was believed that people with birth defects were genetically deficient and were not worth any rec@@ our@@ ses of the society .
Dr. As@@ per@@ ger himself was not a bad person .
he was not a he@@ inous Nazi .
he was just brain@@ washed by the Naz@@ is .
he signed the paperwork and sent many of these au@@ ti@@ stic children to some hospitals for negative treatment , and left them there to die .
you see , it is a very clear medical issue , but there were complex social factors involved .
this happened repeatedly in the US , the UK and the European continent in the 20th century .
there was a famous movie called R@@ ain Man in 1988 . it made autism known to the whole world .
the character Dus@@ tin H@@ off@@ man created was a genius .
he had social behavioral deficits , repetitive behaviors and abnormal language pattern .
in fact , autism is already a global public health problem .
you can find more and more cases of it .
the American Centers for Disease Control ( C@@ DC ) recently reported a scary number , the most recent number is 1 / 68 .
what does it mean ?
among every 68 new@@ bor@@ ns , there is one with autism .
can you believe it ?
how many au@@ ti@@ stic children will there be in the world ?
with a big population , there may be a large number of au@@ ti@@ stic children in China .
I need to explain a little though .
this figure takes into account all the children with autism spectrum disorders , including those with mild autism .
the American government provides good medical insurance and social security support for children with autism .
the government will provide good subsidies to hospitals or schools with au@@ ti@@ stic children .
that is why I guess the figure given is probably a bit exaggerated .
anyway , it is a noticeable situation worth attention in China , because autism diagnosis services in China is far from enough .
in Shanghai , only a handful of pedi@@ atric@@ ians can accurately diagnose autism .
we still need many doctors .
in 1977 , scientists finally discovered the cause of autism .
British scientists found 21 pairs of twins .
identical twins have identical genes .
if one of them has autism , the other has a 60 @-@ 100 % chance of developing autism .
fraternal twins share half the genes , but the odds are as high as 5 @-@ 10 % , much higher than the random rate .
what is more , their immediate relatives are also at risk .
these scientific findings tell us that autism and genetics are clearly related .
but they also tell us that like schizophrenia and other mental disorders , there are still a lot to learn .
we won &apos;t fully understand autism until humans have the ability to truly sequence genes .
in the 1980s and the 1990s , scientists were able to sequence the entire genome , and we were able to really talk about it .
China has the strongest gene sequencing capability in the world .
once a new sequ@@ encer appears in the US , China always buys it right away .
we &apos;ve had the ability to sequence gen@@ omes over and over again since the last century .
in the 1990s , the American government spent USD 3 billion on human genome sequencing .
today , it costs only half the price of an iPhone to have our own genome sequ@@ enced , it is quite easy .
however , we are dealing with a sealed book after sequencing .
now , let us look at what problems are there in this book .
what does genes mean to us ?
genes en@@ code proteins , proteins make up cells , cells make up our brains and bodies .
genes are the headquarters for the normal functioning of our body .
OK , what can happen to genes then ?
look , the book on the right side is a sealed book , it is for the professionals . you do not have to understand it .
there are 3 billion words in it , because our genome contains 3 billion bases .
if anything goes wrong , for example , we have an important gene called Me@@ CP@@ 2 .
if it mut@@ ated , it could cause severe developmental problems for a girl that she might have epilepsy , be unable to talk to people or even take care of herself , etc .
it is like a part of the book is cut , so we cannot get the information .
a gene is just like the lost part .
mutations in genes can make it impossible for us to fully understand the information in the genome .
there is another possibility .
in 2009 , we found that gene duplication can directly cause autism .
what does that mean ?
again , we are facing this sealed book .
we find two identical paragraphs on the upper side and the below , there are repetition in the wrong place .
as you could see , these two paragraphs are identical , which should not happen .
that means one gene becomes two , causing protein levels to rise .
this protein is important for our brains , and its rise causes many boys to develop autism .
that is , mutations in genes can affect the function of proteins and ultimately our brains .
so , how are scientists going to study a complex disease like autism ?
we can divide it into two parts .
the first part is to study the pathogenesis of the disease .
why can a mutation in this gene affect the normal functioning of the brain ?
the second part is to explore possible interventions through our research .
here is an example .
since 2011 , the Institute of Neuro@@ science has been using a strategy to transfer the genes that cause human autism into the monkey genome .
these cute monkeys carry genes that cause autism in humans .
what can happen to them then ?
do you see the difference between them ?
it is easy , right ?
monkeys .
this one is jumping up and down , but this one on the right looks abnormal .
I do not think normal monkeys should have this kind of repetitive behaviors .
it has been circling repeatedly .
they were one year old when we made this video , and now they are six years old .
they are still like that , and I think they are likely to live that way for the rest of their lives .
if we can find a way to change their behavior , we may be able to change other repetitive behaviors .
do these genetically modified monkeys behave like au@@ ti@@ stic children ?
do they also exhibit abnormal social behaviors ?
how do monkeys soci@@ alize ?
you see , the two monkeys on the left sit together and have physical contact .
they interact and this is the natural interaction between animals .
while the two on the right with modified genes seem very cold to each other .
they are genetically modified monkeys , and they barely notice each other .
we actually conducted other experiments , but we are not going to cover them all here .
we have repeatedly tested and studied monkeys of different ages in different groups to see if they are very similar to au@@ ti@@ stic children .
the study , published in 20@@ 16 , was the first to show that monkeys can develop autism if human genes are directly inserted into their gen@@ omes .
this research caused a tremor in the international scientific community at that time , especially in the major media in the United States .
it was also selected as one of the 10 major advances in Chinese science in 20@@ 16 .
why do we do this experiment with genetically modified monkeys ?
we want to get information from these trans@@ genic monkeys that we can &apos;t get from human patients .
take children with autism for example , they are very irrit@@ able and anxious .
doctors may have a hard time persuading them to get detailed brain scans .
so , we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on in the brains of children with autism .
we can study monkeys to see what the mutation does to their brains .
intervention is only possible when changes are understood .
OK , so here &apos;s the big question we get asked all the time , and I ask others too .
can we cure them ?
can we cure autism ?
here is a story . last year , I attended an international conference and met Professor Thomas Bour@@ ger@@ on , a French scientist I greatly admired .
starting in 2000 , he conducted a series of ground@@ breaking genetic studies that identified several of the most important autism genes in human history .
as a junior in this field , I asked him this question : can we cure autism ?
I was very surprised by his answer , &quot; Why should we cure autism ? &quot;
why do we want them to be like us ?
if children with autism have epilepsy or other conditions that affect their health , we should give them medication .
if they just don &apos;t like to say hello to people , if it &apos;s just because they &apos;re intro@@ verted sometimes , why would you want to make them like us ?
are we all the same ?
so , it made me think a lot .
if he &apos;s just a little bit withdrawn , but capable of normal social behaviors , then we do not really need to make them outgoing , right ?
they do not have to party all the time and participate in various social activities all the time .
it &apos;s not necessary .
we all have different personalities .
here is a brief review of some of the major findings in the development of autism over the last century .
first , Dr. As@@ per@@ ger found a gifted child with autism .
Leo Ken@@ ner , on the right side , then gave a medical definition .
there was a time in 1948 when Dr. Ken@@ ner insisted that the condition was caused by the poor quality of their mother .
why was there such a ridiculous view ?
this was actually a medical and scientific over@@ correction .
before 1945 , Nazi Germany thought that people with bad genes were just bad , right ?
this error led both the scientific and medical communities to shy away from pointing out genetic problems , so many diseases including schizophrenia were classified as acquired diseases .
Dr. Ken@@ ner was no exception in 1948 .
there was a funny scene in American movies at that time .
El@@ vis Pres@@ ley saw an au@@ ti@@ stic child in the countryside .
he felt sorry for the child and decided to hug him with love .
then he hugged the child for about five minutes and cured him with this love therapy .
that &apos;s ridiculous , right ?
they do need to be loved , but you cannot just cure them in five minutes .
people thought that way at that time though .
R@@ im@@ lan , the father of a child with autism , surveyed many families with au@@ ti@@ stic children in America and found that they loved their children very much .
and none of the children got sick because of family ap@@ athy .
Dr. ke@@ ener had to admit that autism had nothing to do with how you bring up the kid .
it is a congenital disease .
however , we were unable to sequence the genome until 1977 when we found its relationship to genes .
it wasn &apos;t until the year 2000 that we were able to sequence the genome and found many autism @-@ related genes .
the development of sociology has been more difficult .
I just mentioned that Dr. Ken@@ ner reported 11 au@@ ti@@ stic children in 19@@ 43 .
do you know where most of the 11 children went ?
if my memory serves me right , at least 6 @-@ 7 of them were sent to mental hospitals .
that &apos;s how the United States treated au@@ ti@@ stic children in the 1960s .
they thought there was no cure and those children were unworthy of education .
what should they do ?
the mental hospital seemed to be the right choice to them .
however , some parents were reluctant to give up their children , so they continued to treat them , stubbor@@ nly .
the first child diagnosed with autism was Donald .
he &apos;s probably the happiest au@@ ti@@ stic kid in the world .
why ?
he lived in a small town of less than 10,000 people in western Missouri . his family was well off , and everyone in the town knew him and was happy to help him .
he went to elementary school there and college elsewhere .
in college , his parents even invited his childhood friend to accompany him and help him .
the society at that time was very helpful and friendly to him .
when Donald finished college , he went back to his hometown and got a job in a bank .
with the support of a well @-@ off family , he did not have to work that hard .
he usually went to work in the morning and played golf in the afternoon .
he remained healthy in his 8@@ 0s .
he was probably the heal@@ thiest and luck@@ iest .
there &apos;s probably no other one in the world .
in what environment can an au@@ ti@@ stic child coming from the privilege live a carefree life ?
how could their parents not worry ?
very few .
in the 1960s , many parents of children with autism in the US and the UK set up parents &quot; associations .
why did they do that ?
because they need to work together to tell the government that their children were not in@@ cor@@ ri@@ gible .
and to ask the government and the society for enough resources .
they wanted their children to go to school .
in 1971 , a lawyer representing the association sued the State of Pennsylvania to ask that au@@ ti@@ stic children be allowed to go to school .
they also presented a lot of evidence .
the Pennsylvania government gave them a green light and allowed these children to enter public schools then .
but the road is tor@@ tuous .
California joined in 1974 .
California is one of the largest states in America and has the most advanced culture and technology .
its inclusion symbolizes the acceptance of au@@ ti@@ stic children in American society as a whole .
that was a very tor@@ tuous story .
it is far from being as smooth as I described .
the story began in 1971 , and it was about the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Dou@@ gle and his father Gib@@ son .
Gib@@ son came from a typical middle @-@ class American family , with two girls and a boy .
knowing that Dou@@ gle had autism , Gib@@ son was reluctant to send his child to a mental hospital like other parents did .
Gib@@ son took him to various rehabilitation classes .
unfortunately , the rehabilitation services in the United States were still very backward at that time .
and the government did not provide subsidies , so the rehabilitation effect was not good .
expensive rehabilitation treatment almost exhausted this wealthy family .
Gib@@ son , who had congenital heart disease , lost his job .
he went from a well @-@ to @-@ do engineer to a poor man who had to rent a home and rely on his wife to support the family .
as Dou@@ gle started to go through puberty , he kept losing his temper in public , and Gib@@ son fought on and on until he couldn &apos;t take it anymore .
he took out his family &apos;s gun and ended the kid &apos;s life .
after 1971 , American society began to attach importance to the education of au@@ ti@@ stic children and felt that they could not be abandoned .
in 1974 , an au@@ ti@@ stic boy named Sha@@ wn L@@ ap@@ in had a positive father , Harvey L@@ ap@@ in .
he actively fought the California government for the rights of au@@ ti@@ stic children .
eventually , the bill was passed .
the bill went to the desk of then @-@ governor Ronald Reagan , who had one year left in office .
at that time , he was re@@ public@@ an and Republicans advocated saving government spending and were reluctant to spend a lot of money to provide social security for au@@ ti@@ stic children .
what should he do ?
Harvey L@@ ap@@ in then went to Lloy@@ d N@@ ol@@ an , a famous star at that time , for help .
why would N@@ ol@@ an want to help ?
because N@@ ol@@ an himself was also the father of an au@@ ti@@ stic child .
unfortunately , he was one of the fathers who followed the doctor &apos;s instructions and sent the child to a mental hospital .
he had long been reluctant to admit to the media that he had an au@@ ti@@ stic child .
unfortunately , his child died of cho@@ king in the 1960s because the mental hospital neglected to take care of him .
he felt very guilty about his son &apos;s death .
eventually , he admitted to the media that he had an au@@ ti@@ stic child in the 1970s .
he also admitted that he should not have sent the kid to the mental hospital .
if not , maybe he could still live well .
so since then , he had bravely stepped forward to fight for this right with the parents of au@@ ti@@ stic children .
N@@ ol@@ an and Reagan were good friends in Hollywood , so N@@ ol@@ an called Reagan and said , &quot; I haven &apos;t asked anyone for anything in my life , but I &apos;m not asking your help and please sign this bill , so that many children with this disease like mine will have access to fair education in society and receive donations from the government . &quot;
Reagan finally signed the bill before the last moment , and behind it stood a group of parents of au@@ ti@@ stic children .
that was a very important moment in human history .
by the end of the 20th century , in 1986 , Temple Grand@@ in , an au@@ ti@@ stic genius , became finally a professor at Arizona State University .
she wrote the first book on the inner world of children with autism .
people with autism don &apos;t express themselves , but they can write down their inner thoughts .
temple Grand@@ in turned out to be a remarkable person .
in 2007 , human society brought the study of autism into the realm of science .
since 2007 , China has held a grand ceremony every year on April 2 .
there will be blue light on the Bun@@ d in Shanghai .
autism is known to the whole world now .
I have a book on my desk .
it is called The World of Kang Kang .
I met Kang Kang for the first time at a painting training session of Gol@@ den@@ wings Funds in Beijing .
Gol@@ den@@ wings has a store on Ta@@ obao .
let us take a look at Kang Kang &apos;s paintings .
beautiful , right ?
Kang Kang was born in 1998 .
this is his painting , on the calendar , under his name , Xiao Jing@@ k@@ ang .
not just Kang Kang , there are works of other au@@ ti@@ stic children , such as Cheng Cheng .
and Chen Meng , I like his works the best .
this is my favorite .
a beautiful and artistic snow world .
there are many more .
they are gen@@ i@@ uses , and they got trained by teachers , too .
now , Kang Kang can go to the market and buy some food for dinner just like a normal kid .
I think it is inseparable from the love of his mother .
in this book , Ms. Z@@ ou Wen , Kang Kang &apos;s mother , recorded the process of his recovery since his childhood .
I think he has an amazing mother .
there is an interesting questionnaire at the end of the book .
it &apos;s a self @-@ assessment of autism from the University of Cambridge .
we may joke that probably many of the tech people who work in Silicon Valley are au@@ ti@@ stic .
this is actually a misunderstanding .
I &apos;m sure that many of us are with au@@ ti@@ stic symptoms , too .
scan this Q@@ R code and you will see a self @-@ assessment for autism .
now that I &apos;m encouraging you to take it , I guess I need to unveil my score .
you can keep yours secret though .
as you can see that a score lower than 20 means that you are fine .
if it &apos;s higher than 32 , it may represent something different .
OK , I got a 30 .
I do not think it is a big deal .
although I feel blue from time to time , I &apos;m not that into parting , and I like being alone and reading books , that doesn &apos;t affect my normal life .
I &apos;m sure many people feel the same way as I do .
autism has been around since a long time ago .
as we come to know it , I think it is like a sent@@ ense I enjoy much , &quot; I &apos;m unique , just like everyone else . &quot;
I believe that I am different , just like everyone else .
everyone is different .
we don &apos;t have to change them completely .
what we need to do is to accept them , help them and love them .
let &apos;s take the hands of au@@ ti@@ stic children and bravely embrace the future with doctors , researchers and their parents .
thank you !
good evening , my friends !
today , I want to talk about why we shouldn &apos;t oppose Gen@@ etic Mo@@ dification technology .
this is a popular topic .
before I deliver my speech .
let &apos;s make a small choice together .
so suppose you &apos;re given two kinds of food .
the genetically modified food , and the biot@@ ech food .
put up your hand if you &apos;re willing to choose the genetically modified food .
well , it seems few people put up their hands .
and put up your hand if you &apos;re willing to select the biot@@ ech food .
OK , I see more hands this time .
the truth is the genetically modified food and biot@@ ech food are the same food .
and they are made by using the same technology .
so my friends .
we can &apos;t blindly oppose the genetically modified technology .
well , there was a time when some people thought that the GM food was an American conspiracy against Chinese people and that whoever consumed it would gradually become infer@@ tile and Chinese would die out in the end .
this is a conspiracy theory .
but is this a real conspiracy ?
in fact , in the United States , ordinary people all eat the GM food .
why ?
in the US , there are more than 2,000 different GM foods in the market , and the foods don &apos;t have to carry a GM label .
this is to say , they do not know these are the GM foods .
in my opinion .
Americans must have been the first to taste the GM food as the US is the first to produce such food , right ?
if so , will Americans lose fertility eventually ?
obviously , this is not the case .
driven by the conspiracy theory , a campaign against the GM food was launched in China , with the aim of protecting the Chinese people , or &quot; the descendants of the dragon . &quot;
on the contrary .
this January , the United States allowed the sales of the insect @-@ resistant genetically modified rice , or the IR@@ GM rice that is quite unpopular in China .
what does that mean ?
this means that the IR@@ GM rice can be eaten and sold in the United States .
and this renders the so @-@ called conspiracy theory ground@@ less .
you see , Americans themselves introduce and consume the IR@@ GM rice .
so the conspiracy theory and campaign appear quite ridiculous now , right ?
why is that ?
I &apos;ll show you an example .
I believe all of us in this studio like high @-@ speed train , right ?
high @-@ speed train is the pride of China .
I think all of us are willing to have a long @-@ distance trip by high @-@ speed train and we are all happy to enjoy the speed , convenience and comfort it brings .
but do you know there was a similar movement against the train more than 100 years ago when it was first introduced in China ?
as you can see from the picture here .
a group of people were talking about the devastating effects of the train on the &quot; dragon vein . &quot;
then the movement was launched to &quot; destroy the rail and protect the dragon vein . &quot;
as we see it now , the movement is quite ridiculous .
maybe after another 20 years .
we will find our protest against the GM ridiculous , too .
from my perspective .
we shouldn &apos;t launch the ridiculous campaign against the GM food .
then you may ask what exactly genetic modification is .
well , first I want to introduce the concept of the gene .
simply speaking , a gene is a sequence of ri@@ bon@@ ucle@@ ic acid with a genetic function .
so what is genetic modification ?
what is it ?
in fact .
we can see it both as a technology and a process .
to put it simply .
genetic modification is a technology that transfers the genes from one species to another .
in other words .
it is a process through which the genes of one species are transferred to another species through some media .
that &apos;s why we say it is both a process and a technology .
so we have to think about what it is that we oppose .
the process or the technology , right ?
well , of course , a gene is modified through some media , or as we can say , by natural hybri@@ di@@ zation .
in fact , human beings have noticed natural hybri@@ di@@ zation produces a lot of new varieties .
and we have also learned to conduct artificial hybri@@ di@@ zation .
now , we can achieve genetic modification with biot@@ ech .
so the process of modifying the genes becomes increasingly advanced .
this is a technical point of view .
we can also consider it from the perspective of process .
the genetically modified process can actually occur between different individuals of the same species .
but it can also occur between individuals of different species .
in fact , it is a process of transferring genes , and this requires a medium .
well , I am quite passionate about photography and taking photos .
so I often venture out in order to discover how different insects serve as a medium to transfer genes between different species or between different flowers .
this is the natural genetic modification .
the following picture is also an example of natural genetic modification .
for example .
we plant purple cor@@ ns here , beside which white cor@@ ns are planted .
if the wind blows the pollen of the purple corn to the white corn .
what color will the new variety bear ?
just think about it .
OK , black and white , purple and white , the answers are quite reasonable .
as we can see .
it produces a variety of this color .
apparently , it is different from the white one , and it becomes much more colorful , right ?
so GM is a process of creative mutation .
which gives our bre@@ ed@@ ers more choices .
this is what we call the natural genetic modification .
in fact , bre@@ ed@@ ers try hard to obtain more such genetic variation .
so that they can screen the best genes for cultivating and developing quality varieties .
such as improving its quality , its resistance to insects or diseases and other qualities .
actually , we can also achieve mutations with radiation .
for example , this picture shows space breeding .
in the process , the seeds are sent to space with the rocket and after the cosmic radiation , they undergo mutations .
mutation can also be achieved through the so @-@ called cell hybri@@ di@@ zation by integrating different cells .
however , this kind of mutation is a random process so it takes a lot of time for a Sing@@ el mutation to be done .
the genetic modification we talk about today , or we have talked the most about , is actually achieved by biot@@ ech .
with biot@@ ech .
we can cultivate genetically modified pap@@ aya and cotton .
so let &apos;s take a look at how the genes are modified .
as we just mentioned , there is natural hybri@@ di@@ zation , but it is quite random .
artificial hybri@@ di@@ zation may also be random .
so what if we want it to precisely target and transfer the genes we want ?
well , first we have to find a &quot; car , &quot; or a carrier called plas@@ mid .
we have a small cut in the plas@@ mid , and we can put the targeted gene in it .
then , the plas@@ mid serves as a taxi and takes the gene to a bacterium .
then it multipl@@ ies from one to numerous copies .
so that it can interact with the cells whose genes we need to transfer .
in this process , we can find out that the gene on the plas@@ mid can flow to the cell , and can even squeeze into the nucleus to integrate itself with the chromosome of the cell .
finally , a different white call@@ us is cultivated .
then the call@@ us is cultivated to grow into a seedling and then a seed .
this way , the seed contains genetically modified genes and thus we develop a genetically modified plant .
as we can see , this process is actually consistent with our traditional goal of passing on quality genes .
but it is faster , more accurate , and more efficient .
then let &apos;s discuss another question .
why shouldn &apos;t we oppose genetic modification ?
well , we all know that it is a very tough task to ensure that people all over the world have enough food to eat .
let &apos;s look at the curves .
the orange curve shows population growth trend .
and the blue dotted curve behind it shows the two possibilities for food production .
if we adopt high technology and make good use of the land , the grain growth may follow the above curve .
which means food production can meet the needs of population growth .
but if we don &apos;t adopt such technology .
we will encounter a huge gap in our food supply and such a gap will bring about many problems .
let &apos;s elaborate on it .
the Chinese character &apos; Fan &apos; , or rice , consists of the left and right parts .
what &apos;s the left ?
it &apos;s &apos; Shi &apos; , meaning food or to eat .
and what &apos;s the right ?
it &apos;s &apos; Fan &apos; or rebellion .
so taking the two parts together .
we can see if we can &apos;t guarantee food security , social turmoil might occur .
population expansion poses a serious problem and it puts tremendous pressure on our food security .
what &apos;s exacerb@@ ating the situation is the process of urbanization .
because the infrastructure construction also takes up a lot of land .
this photo was taken 30 years ago somewhere in Shanghai .
well , can any of you recognize where it is ?
well , a same set of photos were taken 20 years later almost in the same place .
can you recognize it this time ?
these are the photos .
can any of you recognize where it is ?
yes , it seems everyone knows it &apos;s Pudong , isn &apos;t it ?
from the photos , we can see clearly that the former quality fields gave way to highways , or urban areas .
so urbanization takes up a lot of land .
China hopes to save 1.8 billion mu of such land .
but it has been a very difficult task so far .
in fact , we still face many problems .
such as increasingly diminishing resources and the volatile global climate .
for example , we may say Shanghai is surrounded by water but you may fail to realize that Shanghai is in a shortage of drinking water .
the scarcity of such resources brings about a lot of problems .
what &apos;s worse , we are still t@@ asked with increasing the output of food to ensure that nobody would suffer from hunger .
what should we do ?
can we try to expand the area of cultivated land ?
it will definitely not work in China .
so maybe we can spray more pesticides and use more fertilizers .
but do you really want to do this ?
the food produced by the pesticides and fertilizers will eventually be eaten by you .
so I believe you are definitely not willing to do so .
this method can &apos;t be adopted in China either .
because the ecological environment of our farm@@ lands has already suffered from severe damage .
so the only option is to draw on the rich genetic resources , and combine them with our new biotechnology , including the genetically modified technology .
in this way , we produce more food in a speedy , accurate , and efficient manner .
as I mentioned earlier , each year 2 million tons of pesticides will be sprayed into the farmland in China .
just imagine what will the 2 million tons of pesticides cause ?
but now we have an alternative technology at hand , that is the insect @-@ resistant genetically modified rice or IR@@ GM rice .
look at this picture , the IR@@ GM rice grows well .
under the condition in which no pesticide is sprayed .
there is a big difference between the IR@@ GM rice and the ordinary rice which is not insect @-@ resistant .
we can say that our traditional way aims to transfer a useful gene , like the white ball , to a better variety .
but it is a time @-@ consuming and inaccurate process .
but the aim of transferring useful genes can also be realized by our current method .
which is a more efficient and accurate approach , and even over@@ comes the reproductive barrier .
for example , the traditional approach of hybri@@ di@@ zation is quite helpless if we want to transfer the drought @-@ resistant gene of the drought @-@ resistant Pop@@ ulus eu@@ phr@@ atic@@ a to rice .
but this transfer can be easily achieved with biot@@ ech and the GM technology .
we can say that the GM technology is quite useful .
some people may ask , despite all its merits , does the GM technology have any side effects ?
well , as a new technology , the GM technology does have some problems .
which should be solved through our efforts .
just as an old saying goes , &quot; Food is the first and paramount necessity of people . &quot;
the first public concern is whether the GM food is safe and whether it will have side effects such as causing illness .
and will it pose a threat to the environment ?
apart from the health and environment issues .
people may also worry about whether we should attach GM labels to the foods so that our right of knowing and choosing is defended .
other concerns may involve whether laws and regulations will be promulgated to regulate these things .
in fact .
China has laws and regulations in place for GM foods .
moreover , a GM product can be produced and commerci@@ alized only after it passes the stringent safety assessments in every stage from its development to its production .
for this reason .
international agencies believe that GM foods or products are safe .
the UN@@ FAO also believes that GM products are safe and legal .
because it is operated under the global framework of GM technology .
OK , We &apos;ve just talked about the reasons for not opposing genetic modification .
so now I want to discuss why we Chinese should be the last to campaign against GM foods .
GM technology has been used globally for nearly 20 years .
during this period .
T@@ expansion to 180 million hectares or roughly about 2.7 or 2.8 billion mu .
the above green line represents the overall cultivation area of GM foods .
the blue line shows the cultivation area in developed countries .
and the red line refers to the developing countries .
this shows that developing countries have exceeded developed countries in terms of the cultivation area .
the whole world is increasing the cultivation area , but it &apos;s a different case in China .
as you can see , we ranked fourth in 2002 , and then moved downwards to the fifth place , then to sixth , and to the eighth .
actually , this rank is very inconsistent with the status of our country .
here is a set of data .
in 2001 , China ranked fourth , following the United States , Canada , and Argentina .
but after 2003 , we were surpassed by Brazil , and in 2007 , we ranked sixth , surpassed by India .
what a pity !
India used to be a cotton importer .
but the use of GM technology has transformed it into a cotton exporter .
as the statistics show , China has lagged far behind India .
for many years , China maintained the sixth place , and many small countries were trying to catch up .
then in 20@@ 16 , China slid to the eighth place , even surpassed by Paraguay and Pakistan .
at first , I was wondering how come Paraguay could closely follow China in the rank for about 10 years .
later , I found Paraguay was a very small country in South America , with a population of only 6 million .
a country with a 1.4 billion population and a country with a 6 million population .
considering the huge difference in population , the rank doesn &apos;t match our national image and our national status .
this echoes a Chinese saying .
&quot; in sailing against the current , we must keep forging ahead or we will keep falling behind . &quot;
apart from being a lucrative technology , genetic modification is also a technological high ground .
if we don &apos;t seize it , other countries will definitely occupy it .
when we are still arguing whether we should develop or adopt GM technology .
many countries have crept up and surpassed us .
I think this is a severe and worrying phenomenon .
and food security is also a very important issue .
China has to import 100 million tons of grain annually .
it &apos;s 100 million tons of grain .
what does that mean ?
it means that every Chinese has to import 70 kilograms of food on average .
what if the countries refuse to export to us one day ?
then this will cause a big problem , right ?
so if we continue to refrain from developing GM technology .
we will definitely lose a good opportunity .
in fact , we had a glorious history of the production of GM foods .
we made such success in our genetically modified cotton , which not only saved our cotton industry .
but also showed a remarkable , eye @-@ catching Chinese image to the whole world .
before the production of genetically modified pap@@ aya , farmers could do nothing to combat the virus .
but today we could see their smile when they harvest the virus @-@ resistant GM cotton .
it &apos;s at this moment that we feel the technology is so creative that it brings happiness to us .
I hope that our technology will make our life better .
thank you !
hello everyone .
I &apos;m Liang Jia &apos;@@ en , from Un@@ is@@ ound .
I &apos;m a typical fan of science , and my interest in science has lasted for years ever since I was a high school student .
I began to know AI in university .
and for twenty years after that , from being a university student to getting my doctor &apos;s degree , to starting my career and finally founding my own company , I &apos;ve never for a second devi@@ ated from the tracks of AI .
the reason I , despite all the ups and downs , have always stuck to AI , is that I identify with the AI dream so profoundly and have such deep faith in it .
and plus , it &apos;s indeed a field that is in@@ exhaustible in questions .
so there is no way for us to just quit .
today my topic is AI , a new species that human beings can tame .
this new species has given us many surprises , such as Al@@ pha@@ Go , which had swept across the globe in 20@@ 16 and left the entire world exhilar@@ ated ..
if you take a close look , you may find that AI , once confined in science fiction , is entering into the real world .
keeping surprising us and giving us new hopes .
but it also brings with it confusion , concerns , or even fears .
so today , as one who has been working on AI for twenty years , I wish I could give you a professional interpretation of what exactly is going on , its origin , history , characteristic , and where it is going .
will it finally get out of human control , become the last invention by mankind and end up as the termin@@ ator of human beings ?
that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about today .
personally I don &apos;t think there is anything mysterious at all about AI .
it &apos; s just a brand @-@ new intelligent species that is created based on rational analysis , data and algorithms .
the possibility of AI had long been talked of , yet it was Alan T@@ uring , a household name to us all , that first seriously considered the possibility .
let &apos;s re@@ wind the time back to eighty years ago .
in 19@@ 36 , Alan T@@ uring was thinking about letting machines think for human beings .
and he actually did a research into that .
his earliest idea was that , when we calculate , we have to use a pen and paper .
but would it be possible that the entire process of calculating could be abstr@@ acted into a mathematical model through which problems can be solved by some machine ?
such machines certainly didn &apos;t exist then .
he was absolutely thinking from a theoretical , mathematical perspective .
but he did write a paper , which somehow proved what he imagined was nonetheless possible .
a brand @-@ new journey was thus launched .
and to commemorate Alan T@@ uring , the great pioneer , the most important prize throughout the entire computer industry - T@@ uring Award - was established .
so what happened after Alan T@@ uring put forward this idea and proved it possible ?
the first computer made its debut ten years later .
since 1946 , computers have been setting one record after another .
another ten years passed , and in 1956 , young academics like Mar@@ vin Min@@ sky bl@@ azed a new trail , namely the trail of AI , which was extending into indefinite possibilities .
Min@@ sky himself was the first T@@ uring Award winner who specialized in AI .
therefore his influence was huge .
as you can see , 62 years into AI development , we have got Al@@ pho@@ Go who out@@ performed human professional Go players , and the entire AI industry is going through tremendous changes .
as for the ordinary internet users and media , they are more susceptible to changes in the computer industry , especially in the internet industry .
so far , AI industry has actually hit two peaks and bot@@ toms .
the third peak for AI , as we can see , is just breaking out all of a sudden .
that &apos;s because the previous accumulation has laid a solid foundation for it .
but why , given the two previous tr@@ ough@@ s , are we still confident that a new species will be born in the third AI peak ?
let me use some figures to help you understand .
first we think this third AI peak comes at a perfect moment that combines all kinds of favorable conditions .
the No. 1 advantage we now have is the unprecedented computing power .
take this Hua@@ wei P@@ 9 for example .
it is portable and highly energy efficient .
now suppose we traveled with it back to 1974 , five years after the first moon landing .
we would find people were still using Intel &apos;s flagship 80@@ 80 microprocessor , which , trust me , would be sec@@ killed by this Hua@@ wei P@@ 9 .
if we could time @-@ travel to that time , scientists back then would treat us like god .
that would be so cool .
what I want to say is : the computing power today has achieved a new high .
next , let &apos;s take a look at data .
data is increasing by millions of TB every day .
that was never seen at the first and second peak .
after all , there was no internet then , thus we couldn &apos;t get much true information about the computer users .
then there are also the dividends of the computing power , or the technological accumulation .
we can see some people never talk about AI without emphasizing deep learning , as if a man ignoring deep learning would know nothing about AI .
this school of AI academics is in fact , to put it simply , advocating stimulating the neural network of human brain so as to solve problems concerning human intelligence .
that is a very natural idea .
and that idea has been implemented and developed ever since 19@@ 43 , when the single neuron was abstr@@ acted into and displayed by a mathematical model .
a great moment for AI has come , because we have got the great computing power , great storage capacity and great technologies .
the second favorable condition is the internet of things , which , combined with the Internet , is giving AI full play .
that &apos;s a great platform for AI .
but the most important condition is the support from the government and the people .
the third high tide of AI , led by China and US , I believe , will sweep across the globe .
so far many countries have already joined in the AI development , among which China and US are the two biggest players .
China exc@@ els in application , while US is taking the lead in basic @-@ level technical innovation .
for now , they seem to be even in the AI battlefield .
I believe there is huge room for both for further development .
with the government support , the competitive field of AI development is also attracting thr@@ ongs of star@@ tu@@ ps , professionals and industrial investments .
all those favorable conditions are convincing us of a prospect that the third AI peak will be completely different from the previous ones .
a whole new species will be born out of the combination of our rationality , data and computing .
how should we judge this new species ?
let &apos;s begin with its genes .
where is it going ?
what traits does it have ?
the rationality , data and computing I just mentioned can be transformed to mathematical terms .
the first is mathematical model .
whatever problem we want to solve , we must first abstract it into something in mathematics so that it could be addressed by the machines .
once the abstract model is produced , we must make it work and keep improving it , thus we need algorithms .
and algorithms must depend on data to work at their best .
and all of the three steps above must be based on a reliable computing power .
that &apos;s why Al@@ pho@@ Go is so good .
and its successor , Al@@ pha@@ Z@@ ero , is said to even have become independent from data resources , for it can simulate them by itself .
after all , the moves on a chess board are predictable , and that makes the input of external data no longer necessary .
that is an example of how we &apos;ve built a species by combining a mathematical model , algorithms , data and computing .
such a new species , as long as we keep pushing it forward , will go on evolving .
and technical advances and data accumulation will step up its evolution .
AI as a new species is very much like a child who is amazingly good at computing .
it is diligent and hard @-@ working , always in the middle of computing and learning from the data it is provided with .
and its mathematical talent lies in its great capability to abstract and compute .
as it grows up , this child must receive enough nutrition from the government , businesses and individuals .
today &apos;s AI has already possessed a very high degree of sensory ac@@ uity .
its visual and auditory sense is approaching or even out@@ performing that of human beings .
but on the other hand , its cognitive ability is perhaps even less than that of a primary school student , for it can &apos;t understand the content .
but it &apos;s just a matter of time .
when it has gained better sensory and cognitive abilities , it will show signs of mat@@ uration and begin to repay the society .
it will then provide the society with positive services , and the social resources , in return , will further enhance AI development .
thus there will be a cycle of positi@@ vity .
that &apos;s what I think concerning where AI is going .
so , will this new species , just like all the other species on the Earth , follow certain rules of survival ?
my answer is a definite yes .
there are three rules AI must obey .
first , be efficient .
it must precisely and instantly tackle human beings &apos; problems .
that is also a basic function we expect of it .
it can &apos;t survive with a low efficiency .
second , it must provide rich experiences for us .
if AI just means a monotonous kind of command control , then however precise and efficient it is , without rich offerings of experience it will never survive .
what we need is more diversified and personalized contents and services from it .
that &apos;s important .
the third important rule is that AI must give us warm feelings .
what does that mean ?
it means AI must understand and show love to us human beings .
only when AI stops looking so cold will we human beings feel willing to dedicate ourselves to it , thereby giving it a chance to survive , improve and develop .
so if this new species keeps evolving and finally fits into our society , what will it bring to us ?
will it just become an ordinary device like in the past , or will it be a game @-@ chang@@ er ?
I &apos;ll side with the latter . AI will usher in decisive and profound changes to the human beings .
here we may sum up those changes from two aspects .
number one , liberation .
ever since Alan T@@ uring , AI has always been imagined and designed as a substitute for men during the easy , repeated or monotonous work .
it will just free us , right ?
actually we have already launched a such project in Peking Union Medical College Hospital .
doctors in Beijing normally get off work around 16 : 30 .
but that doesn &apos;t mean they can go home at once , for they have to spend another three to four hours in sorting through the medical records at the hospital .
it &apos;s a terribly time @-@ consuming job , but it &apos;s also necessary .
in this project we provided the voice recognition technology for the hospital , which enabled the doctors to record as he worked .
the original three to four hours were instantly reduced to one hour or so .
that &apos;s what I mean about liberation .
the easy job of sorting through medical records occupies a disproportionate share of the time of the professional doctors , but the job can &apos;t be sh@@ ir@@ ked .
AI lifts the doctors out of the tedious labor and helps them spare time for more valuable things .
the second change AI will cause might be more exhilar@@ ating , for according to human beings , every time a new machine appears , human intelligence will be extended .
it &apos;s like we &apos;ve got an intellectual telescope .
before the telescope we could only look at the sky or the earth with our own eyes .
our view was quite limited .
but facilities like the telescope now extend our sight into the space a billion light years beyond .
in future , mankind must also have the ability to discern things from the big data .
the entire Internet is backed by mountains of data , but what exactly do those data mean ?
perhaps nobody knows .
for example , when we were developing the automotive navigation products , we took it for granted that those products must be a No.1 rigid demand , for the drivers must need them .
but as time went , we found that automotive navigation could only rank the 3rd or 4th among all demands .
then we began to realize that , actually , most people just drive cars to and from work .
on those occasions they don &apos;t need navigation instructions at all .
they only need them when they are going to a new location .
so the big data will change our stereotyp@@ ed understanding about things , and lead us to think from different perspectives and at a deeper level .
those are the two major changes I think AI will bring to human society .
and they will exert massive influence on the entire society .
growing human cognition about science , AI and big data , I believe , in particular , will lead to revolutionary changes .
but will AI get out of control and become un@@ manageable ?
we mustn &apos;t be arbitrary on that . instead , we must return to its genes and methodology to find the right answer .
as I mentioned earlier in my speech today , AI is defined as a mathematical model that helps men solve problems .
it depends on algorithms to learn and improve its problem solving ability .
this learning process of AI reinforced by big data and super computing is the strongest part of it , and yet it is completely controllable for us .
so I &apos;m convinced that this new species is one we can absolutely manage .
it is not so scary as we have imagined , but rather , quite amiable .
based on the foregoing , I &apos;ve reached two conclusions .
first , AI itself is not evil .
you agree with me , right ?
AI itself is not evil .
it is human who may be evil .
whether AI will benefit or destroy mankind is completely decided by men themselves .
so controlling the risks of AI is in fact a problem of controlling people .
that &apos;s a very important point .
the second conclusion is that , human beings as individuals will find it harder and harder to beat this new intelligent species AI .
for its super ability to learn from and grow on the collective human wisdom makes it inv@@ incible .
but it &apos;s comforting to know that AI can absolutely be controlled by human beings .
that &apos;s to say , as a new , controllable species , in future , AI will perme@@ ate into more areas of our life , change us , enrich our experiences and re@@ shape us .
but we must always remember what Bill Gates once said .
never overes@@ timate the change that will occur in the next two years , for there are so many difficult problems yet to be solved .
and never underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten , for everything might be up@@ ended .
here , on this precious occasion , I also want to pay tribute to Professor Mar@@ vin Min@@ sky , the great pioneer in AI .
he once said , &quot; The brain happens to be a meat machine . &quot;
this proposition has urged our deep thinking about whether there is a fundamental difference between the silicon @-@ based machines and the carbon @-@ based human beings .
it &apos;s a question worth examining , for it leads to yet another question 。
as AI advances , will it finally have an independent will ?
but this question I &apos;ll leave to you .
thank you !
hello everyone !
the topic of my speech today is gene editing .
in 1978 , the world &apos;s first test @-@ tube baby was born .
there have been more than six million test @-@ tube babies in the world so far , and 7@@ 00,000 more are born every year on average .
then in 20@@ 17 , there was another important event .
for the first time , the scientists used gene editing technology to edit human embryos with genetic mutations , and this mut@@ ant gene will cause congenital heart disease .
this represents that human beings have entered the era of gene editing .
so what exactly is gene editing ?
what can this technology be applied to ?
as we know , human genetic information is stored in DNA .
computers use numbers 0 and 1 to en@@ code and calculate the information .
the human genome uses four nucle@@ oti@@ des , namely Ad@@ en@@ ine ( A ) , Th@@ y@@ mine ( T ) , Cy@@ tos@@ ine ( C ) and Gu@@ an@@ ine ( G ) , to en@@ code its genetic information .
the human genome contains three billion nucle@@ ob@@ ases and three billion nucle@@ oti@@ des .
it en@@ codes 25,000 genes , and each gene en@@ codes a type of protein .
everyone knows that protein is the execut@@ or of our life activities .
it not only constitutes our body , but also determines how we exercise and how we think .
it is the hardware that makes up our body .
the genome is the big blueprint for the formation of our entire organism .
it differs from one another .
therefore , a tiny genetic difference brings about different heights , bodily forms and skin colors among people .
if these genes mut@@ ate , they can also lead to some genetic diseases , and if we can correct the mut@@ ated base of the gene in a certain way , we can treat the disease theoretically .
so scientists are now very fascinated by this technology , but for a long time , there has been no way for them to make a breakthrough .
so why is this so difficult ?
if we print all three billion pieces of genetic information on books , we need a thousand books each with a thousand pages , and there are three thousand letters on each page .
what &apos;s more , all these books must be packed in a cell nucleus measuring only a thous@@ and@@ th of a milli@@ meter in size .
so just imagine how difficult it is to find out the mut@@ ated base when you are reading a book like this .
imagine that you have to find out one typ@@ o after reading a thousand copies of Leg@@ ends of the Con@@ d@@ or Her@@ oes .
this is a very challenging case .
but the scientists have infinite creativity .
they made a major breakthrough back in 2012 .
three scientists , one from Germany and the other two from the United States , have made a major breakthrough in gene editing technology .
they invented a new technology called CR@@ IS@@ PR , which became the most widely used gene editing tool since its appearance .
its composition is very interesting .
it &apos;s composed of this purple protein and the blue nucle@@ ic acid in the middle .
this protein is a magical molecular machine that slides on the genome to find the sequence it needs to cut .
more amazingly , the nucle@@ ic acid sequence in the middle is programmable , which means that we can artificially input AT@@ CG information into it .
then you can target anywhere in the genome , to edit the genes by cutting and replacing them , thus realizing gene editing .
so where is such a delicate and efficient machine from ?
it is actually a product from the process of bacterial evolution in nature , and its true inventor is bacteria .
when we talk about bacteria , we all think they will infect us at the first place .
in fact , the life of bacteria themselves is tough too .
they will also be infected by virus , and we call the virus that inf@@ ects the bacteria pha@@ ge .
many bacteria die after they are infected by pha@@ ge , but some of them will survive .
and these survivors will record the information of the intr@@ uder .
these bacteria &apos;s way of recording is so special , and it &apos;s no exaggeration to say they hate the pha@@ ge with every inch of their cores .
because the bacteria store the pha@@ ge &apos;s information on their own gen@@ om@@ ic DNA , then they can pass the information to their descendants , so that all their descendants can know that there was such an intr@@ uder that had attacked them .
so the next time when the pha@@ ge , the green and blue molecules shown on the screen , attacks the bacteria again , the bacteria can extract the genetic information from their genome and completely destroy the pha@@ ge with the CR@@ IS@@ PR molecular machine that we just mentioned .
this molecular machine is a product of the evolution of the biological world after hundreds of millions of years , and it &apos;s of very high efficiency .
after the scientists discover it , they further modify it to make it more efficient and easier to be programmed .
this is the exact tool we can use to edit the genome .
scientists are very imaginative .
they immediately applied the technology to almost all fields once it was mature .
in addition to scientific researches , CR@@ IS@@ PR is applied to synthetic biology .
synthetic biology is a science with which we modify the genes of microbes , plants and animals to synthesize the compounds we need , including drugs , degrad@@ able plastics , as well as different sources of energy .
these clean energy are often renewable and can replace petroleum .
then of course on the other hand , synthetic biology is used to meet human demand for food by carrying out genetic improvement on animals and plants .
after decades of hard work , the Australian scientists have bred an ordinary local lean sheep into a hy@@ per @-@ mus@@ cled species called Tex@@ el .
this sheep is an excellent species , but the breeding process took a few decades .
the genome sequencing finds out that the main difference between the two sheep species is that there are different bases in the sheep &apos;s M@@ ST@@ N gene .
look here , the Ad@@ en@@ ine marked in green changes into the Gu@@ an@@ ine marked in red .
and this is the very gene that controls the muscle growth and development .
so now with the help of genome editing technology , we only need two or three years instead of decades to breed a brand new species .
the technology can be applied to sheep as well as cattle , pigs and fish .
of course , everyone is more concerned about their own health , and gen@@ om@@ ic technology can also be used for the treatment of diseases .
take sick@@ le cell anemia , one of the commonly seen genetic diseases , for example .
it is caused by the mutation of a base on the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , changing the beautiful red blood cell from ob@@ late shape to sick@@ le shape , so we call it sick@@ le cell and it is the cause of sick@@ le cell anemia .
so how can we treat this gene mutation ?
we can extract the patient &apos;s hemat@@ opo@@ i@@ etic stem cells , use CR@@ IS@@ PR for gene editing , fix the mutation , and then re @-@ inject them back into the patient to cure the disease .
of course , this technology sounds very attractive , but as a new technology , it has its own less perfect side .
same as gene editing technology , the CR@@ IS@@ PR may result in off @-@ target effects .
the so @-@ called off @-@ target effect , in a straight@@ away statement , is that you miss your target when shooting .
in a worse scenario , you shoot the target nearby that is particularly important .
if the wrong target is a tumor sup@@ pres@@ sor gene , the off @-@ target effect may increase the possibility of inducing cancer , so we should be very cautious when using CR@@ IS@@ PR technology .
now I &apos;d like to ask my first question .
as gene editing is risky , are you willing to be genetically edited ?
for example , there is 90 % of possibility to cure your disease by editing your genes , but there still exists one percent of danger that gene editing may result in a new disease , even cancer .
would you like to be genetically edited ?
I think you need some time to think it over .
here comes my second question , would you like your offspring to be genetically edited ?
this is an even more difficult question .
let me give you some background introduction first .
as we know that when the first test tube baby was born in 1978 , it actually caused quite a stir in society .
there were many people against it , thinking it violated the rules of natural evolution , the will of God and the social ethics .
however more and more people today are accepting this technology .
it has become a regular treatment method in hospitals .
there are 7@@ 00,000 test @-@ tube babies born every year , and they have become part of our society .
how far is this gene editing technology from us today ?
we can see very clearly on this picture that the big cell in the middle is a fertili@@ zed egg , and a needle is injecting CR@@ IS@@ PR , the molecular machine , into the fertili@@ zed egg to edit human &apos;s gene .
when this cell divides and forms an embryo , it can be transplanted into the mother .
as I explained on my first slide , scientists have been able to complete the genetic editing from the fertili@@ zed egg to the embryo .
now there is one step left to transplant the embryo into the mother and develop it into a baby , which is a very mature technology .
so gene editing is very , very close to us .
then we can expect the first application of this technology is to correct genetic mutations .
we ourselves have some genetic defects , and we certainly don &apos;t want to pass them on to our children .
even if the defect is a rec@@ essive gene which does not show any symptoms , you definitely don &apos;t want your child to carry such a gene either .
then we can use gene editing technology to guarantee that your offspring would grow up health@@ ily .
I think this is a shared wish of every parent .
once we set foot on this sector , which is only our first step , we will inevitably continue to go on .
so what we can forecast is that human beings may face the challenge of human gene improvement .
since we can change a lean sheep into a well @-@ mus@@ cled one , why can &apos;t we make ourselves more muscular ?
or we can make our brains smarter , even combine the two into one to make ourselves more muscular and intelligent , can &apos;t we ?
but it doesn &apos;t come that easy to decide whether or not we can or want to do this .
first of all we must understand that there is only the most adaptive rather than the best gene in the world .
for instance , pale skin is a popular body feature that everyone favors , but it is very vulnerable to ultraviolet rays .
the incidence rate of skin cancer is very high among white people , and there are barely any black people suffering from this disease .
so having pale skin is a defect in the gene .
the case will be even worse if your skin is very pale and cannot get tan@@ ned .
the second example is the genes that contribute to obesity .
in fact , it is not a single but a group of genes .
now obesity sounds a bit derog@@ atory .
but in ancient times , it was a great advantage for human beings .
imagine that on the vast African sav@@ anna , a group of sav@@ ages was desperately chasing an ant@@ elope .
after running for a dozen kilometers , they finally caught the ant@@ elope .
what would they do then ?
they would immediately eat up the ant@@ elope , until they were too full to move .
why ?
because if you were unable to eat it up , the lions and the vul@@ tures would come over to grab your food .
and you did not have a refrigerator to store the food at that time .
also , the salv@@ ages knew they would not see another ant@@ elope the next day , the third day , and even after a whole week .
so they had to eat all the food , plus a part of genes must digest and absorb the food as part of their body as soon as possible , and store it as well .
where is the storage place ?
the best storage place is the belly and the waist .
the er@@ g@@ onom@@ ics has proven that these parts are the best weight @-@ bearing area on human body .
they will not affect body movement .
these genes guarantee our ancestors to survive , and the ape men who did not have these genes might be starving in a few days and might soon be dead .
so these genes are advantageous .
not only that , some pathogenic genes in our common sense may also be good for us , such as the sick@@ le cell anemia I just talked about .
as we know that in southern China , 20 % of the total population , that is , one in every five people carries this kind of genetic mutation , the proportion of which is very high .
the ratio can even reach 40 % in some parts of Africa .
if the sick@@ le cell gene is pathogenic or even lethal , how can it still survive and exist in such a huge amount of people ?
that &apos;s because of the environment where the gene lives .
these places the gene live in are very hot and breed many mosquitoes and bugs , resulting in the outbreak of malaria , which is still a very deadly disease among people despite the fact we have found quin@@ ine and ar@@ tem@@ is@@ in@@ in .
according to the World Health Organization , there still were 7@@ 00,000 people killed by malaria in 2015 .
however , those who are naturally immune to malaria are the groups of people who have various shapes of red blood cells and carry the gene mutations that cause sick@@ le cell anemia .
that means malaria can never invade these cells .
so an advantage today may become a disadvantage tomorrow , and the vice versa .
in this case , we might think that are we going to do genetic editing on ourselves ？
or on our offspring ?
you feel like that correcting one of the genes in your child &apos;s body today was a good gift for him or her , but when he or she grows up , the environment may have changed and turn the gift you gave into a disaster .
how painful and complicated will you feel at that time ?
so gene editing is by no means an easy task to do .
we must have enough understanding of it .
but does that mean we are going to abandon gene editing instead of doing it ?
looking back at our history , we can figure out that the one shared wish reflected in all the myths , novels , or the Hollywood block@@ bu@@ sters in human history is that human beings want to be smarter , stronger , and pret@@ tier .
the God , the Super@@ man , and the daughter of the God , all gather these advantages in one .
this wish is rooted deep in human &apos;s mind .
on the other hand , take a look at our own genes now .
if they stay as the same as those in the Stone Age , can they adapt to the modern society well ?
as we know that after the Industrial Revolution , big muscles are not so necessary for human body .
strong muscles like D@@ way@@ ne &quot; The Rock &quot; Johnson &apos;s or Schwar@@ zen@@ eg@@ ger &apos;s could only show their value on the film screens of Hollywood .
if these guys go working in the factory , they can even not get the title of model worker .
then how about our intelligence ?
we all know that in some aspects , human beings have already been defeated by artificial intelligence such as Al@@ pha@@ Go .
so humans today are in the face of many challenges .
the emergence of gene editing technology at this moment is definitely not an accident , but an inevitable trend of historical development .
we should not run away from this technology .
escape is never a correct attitude .
in fact , we probably get nowhere to run .
let &apos;s think about our ancestors .
in history , the evolution of nature gave them a few genetic advantages , enabling them to use fire , to invent and use tools , to better communicate with each other and organize a tribe .
so they were able to step out of Africa , cross the continents of Africa and Asia and set their feet across the globe .
we are the desc@@ ents of our ancestors .
should we continue to bravely go along this path ?
only the continuous evolution and development is the way of human survival .
those close relatives of human being , including Upper C@@ ave Man and the Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al , have already disappeared in the long history .
okay , as a saying goes , &quot; If you &apos;re on the wrong road , running is useless . &quot;
so in the face of many new technologies nowadays , such as artificial intelligence and gene editing , it &apos;s important for us to think with our own wisdom on what can we do to embrace these technologies , and guide ourselves on the right path to use them .
we need to understand and study the technologies , and put them into practical use .
only by this mean can we improve the technologies constantly .
improvements are not only manifested in technological advancement .
we should not only make technologies safer and more efficient , but also think carefully about their application system and the actual social status .
then we can decide how far and when can we use the technology , and how to solve the ethical problems brought about by it .
these need all our wisdom and joint efforts .
but in any case , I think the diversity of human genes is very important , because diversity is one of the most important sources of human evolution , and we all want to see a diversified world .
at last , I &apos;d like to end today &apos;s speech with a sentence from Darwin &apos;s The Origin of Species .
Darwin said in The Origin of Species that &quot; It is not the strongest of the species that survi@@ ves , nor the most intelligent that survi@@ ves . it is the one that is most adaptable to change . &quot;
that &apos;s all , thank you very much !
hello everyone .
I &apos;m Guo Yong@@ jian .
I feel very glad to be here today in Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u and talk about data security .
but before my speech .
let &apos;s first do an experiment together .
please take a look at the pictures shown on the screen .
is there anything you are familiar with ?
perhaps none , for I &apos;ve already done a similar test with the staff members of Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u .
there is also a screen@@ shot of a page from my We@@ Chat Mom@@ ents .
here is the question for you : when you entered this room , did your Wi@@ Fi connect automatically .
or did you manually connect to our free Wi@@ Fi network ?
I can tell you , all those Wi@@ Fi options you couldn &apos;t connect to are real .
the rest are fake .
how come ?
let &apos;s do another experiment .
and the experiment goes like this .
those whose cell@@ phones have connected to our Wi@@ Fi please open your browser .
just open it , and don &apos;t worry .
you don &apos;t need to do anything else .
you will then see my profile page on Baidu Bai@@ ke .
can you see it ?
it was actually pushed to you by me through the Wi@@ Fi network .
and , though in a passive manner , you have received my information .
if , instead of my profile page , I had pushed to you a ph@@ ishing link just like the one mentioned in the video .
then perhaps none of you would have been spared by the ph@@ ishing sc@@ am .
this vulnerability of Andro@@ id cell@@ phones was actually discovered a long time ago .
but it is only recently that it &apos;s begun to become a sc@@ amming tool .
anytime we connect to a public Wi@@ Fi .
we are perhaps exposing ourselves to such ph@@ ishing attacks .
so the advice I &apos;ll give you here is .
never connect to the public or the free Wi@@ Fi , wherever you are .
let &apos;s look at another example .
you must hear of Edward S@@ now@@ den .
he used to be a CIA employee and was sent to work in an outsourcing company of N@@ SA .
there he got access to a large amount of US &apos;s highly classified information .
among which there was a PR@@ IS@@ M electronic data mining program .
he was exasper@@ ated by the global surveillance program launched by the US government .
how can they spy on ordinary people and their relations with foreigners like that ?
so he quit .
after leaking the PR@@ IS@@ M documents to journalists from The Guardi@@ an and the Washington Post .
S@@ now@@ den began his life as a most @-@ wanted fugitive .
his story aler@@ ts us to the fact that data leakage can happen around us at any time .
as the big data age approaches .
our life is largely facilitated by its precisely @-@ directed push notifications and other data services .
but what &apos;s lying on the other side of the big data age ?
our personal data are being collected on a daily ba@@ is@@ is and are benefiting the big data analy@@ tics .
the plus side of this is that it might also benefit the entire human race .
the minus side is , well , I &apos;d better leave that to your imagination .
our data can even draw a three @-@ dimensional portrait of us .
here are some of my private data that I find stored in my phone .
obviously its location service remembers all the places I &apos;ve been to .
according to those data , I should have been to Beijing , Wuhan , Guangdong and Tianjin within a certain month .
and the navigation app reveals more details of my trip .
where exactly have I been to ?
let &apos;s take a look .
there is a very clear record of my whereabouts in Wuhan .
it says I have been to a hotel .
and even gives the exact check @-@ in time .
lucky for me , my wife isn &apos;t a digital foren@@ s@@ ics specialist .
or else she is sure to give me a hard time by gr@@ illing me about what I was doing there .
what other information can they tell ?
they might also tell what kind of books and news I like , and what things can capture my attention .
that &apos;s a lot to leak , but you should know that big internet giants are far better in leaking things .
here is an terrible instance revealed very recently .
a database of 1.4 billion clear text credentials was discovered on the dark web .
what exactly were those text credentials ?
they contained all our account names and passwords .
which can be easily abused if they fall into wrong hands .
I downloaded the database myself .
and guess what I found inside it ?
all our registration information for Ta@@ obao , Lin@@ ked@@ In , Ti@@ anya , Yahoo and the emails was there .
my colleagues tested with their own passwords .
only to find that almost 90 percent of the employees from our client companies fell prey to this information leak .
as for myself , one of my email passwords was also listed in the database .
the only people that were spared were a few cleaning ladies .
in such a context , some might suggest .
can we just not share data and not use those tracking apps ?
let &apos;s look at a We@@ Chat data report released in 20@@ 17 .
there were 900 million We@@ Chat users every day sending out 38 billion messages and making over 200 million voice and video calls .
and how many apps and mobile devices were being used every day ?
we can see that each of the ten most popular apps was occupying over 500 million devices per day .
and how much time were cell@@ phones taking from us per day ?
the report says three hours , at the very least .
that means , sleeping time aside .
we devoted one third of our daytime hours to cell@@ phones and apps .
and there is another thing .
we are entering into an age where the internet of things predomin@@ ates .
it means more convenience will be brought into our life .
but as things like the intelligent clos@@ est@@ ool emerge , our most private information , such as our routine toilet time , is also being recorded by the internet .
what can we do about that ?
actually we are all running naked without anything to cover our body .
how can we go through such an age un@@ sc@@ athed ?
and our data , where exactly are they going ?
actually they are all sco@@ oped by the internet companies who are ambitious in big data analy@@ tics .
we seem to be powerless in front of online threats .
and yet still we can &apos;t live without We@@ Chat or the apps .
that &apos;s a terrible truth we have to accept .
but surely there must be something we can do to protect ourselves ?
the core is to protect those companies who have our private data .
they can use our data for good ends .
but we are lo@@ ath to see malicious people and criminals use our data to sc@@ am us .
let me say it again .
protect the companies .
but is there a detailed plan for that .
or , is there a solution for future data security ?
you know , I work in the field of digital foren@@ s@@ ics .
so I know a lot about the information security industry in China .
there are maj@@ or@@ ly five approaches we can adopt to ensure future data security .
and actually they have already been largely put into practical use .
chief among them is the graded protection of information security , or the &quot; graded protection &quot; for short .
it is a rule that urges all the businesses and government departments to establish their own system that could help them better manage security , equipment , personnel and regulations , and protect their data and related back@@ ups .
so where is the graded protection policy most strictly implemented ?
in the government departments , or , on their websites .
that &apos;s why we are seeing far fewer attacks on the government websites now .
but what about the companies that hold our data ?
are they also obe@@ ying this rule and protecting information on a graded basis ?
any lax attitude on their part might wre@@ ak dreadful havoc .
those companies who hold all kinds of data .
especially the small @-@ sized ones , must strictly follow the requirements of the graded protection .
then we should strengthen the protection of data .
we often hear people mention the concept &quot; boundary . &quot;
in some organizations , data security is guaranteed through very strict measures : the Internet and In@@ tran@@ et are completely separated , and mutual data exchange is impossible .
nor can any internal data be sent out .
but are these measures really so flaw@@ less ?
you might hear of a computer virus named Stu@@ x@@ net .
the Stu@@ x@@ net attack maj@@ or@@ ly occurred in Iran .
a@@ and its focus was on the country &apos;s nuclear power plants and national grids .
it was a very special virus .
so who invented it ?
reportedly US and Israel , who were alarmed by Iran &apos;s nuclear development .
Stu@@ x@@ net , through a contaminated USB stick , found its way into the intran@@ et of a research institute .
then it ruined those machines equipped with target hardware devices .
and f@@ aked data that could disarm any doubts about the functioning of the machines .
as it turned out , Iran &apos;s nuclear development took a big hit .
data security actually should be bound@@ ary@@ less .
there should not be a boundary erected between the Internet and the In@@ tran@@ et .
isolation doesn &apos;t necessarily guarantee security .
we must be on constant standby to protect our data .
a security guard at the doorway doesn &apos;t mean I &apos;ll be safe in the room .
I may feel more reas@@ sured if I have a body@@ guard around that could take bullets for me at any time .
that is what bound@@ ary@@ less data protection means .
the bound@@ ary@@ less protection asks us to always follow and guard the crucial information .
many companies have already begun their study on bound@@ ary@@ less protection .
data are generated inside an intran@@ et and circulated within a company .
but the entire process , from their being generated , modified , canceled to their being circulated and released , is rarely supervised .
some companies may argue that they have already been perfectly armed with their internal auditing system and log management system .
which can record all the moves of the data .
but the problem is , not all the details are put down .
in this context .
we must strengthen supervision on the data .
for example , if we find someone , such as S@@ now@@ den , is using a file that he shouldn &apos;t have got access to .
we might interpret it as &quot; rule @-@ breaking , &quot; or &quot; abnormal . &quot;
then we might investigate into this , call police and have him arrested before he leaks the file .
that &apos;s how a sensible monitoring process should work .
but our current supervision on data is far from mature and is yet to be further enhanced .
and here is another thing , sometimes even when we have done a very good job in adopting all the methods available to protect our data .
things might still go wrong .
why ?
because new bugs just keep popping up and falling into the hands of hackers .
if you read the updates on information security .
you might find that every day there are some new vulner@@ abilities being exposed .
just as was shown in the video I played earlier .
the cellphone bug has actually existed for years .
but no one noticed it until recently it got involved in an alarming sc@@ am .
such sc@@ ams may happen around us every day .
what can we do if we are sc@@ ammed ?
don &apos;t worry .
you can always turn to computer foren@@ s@@ ics , database foren@@ s@@ ics , network foren@@ s@@ ics and mobile foren@@ s@@ ics for help .
as a digital foren@@ s@@ ics specialist myself .
I can assure you that you will need us .
so what exactly do we digital foren@@ s@@ ics specialists do ?
we are just like forensic experts in the digital world .
we can re@@ trace every step of an occurrence and gather evidence that can help you in court .
there are things that we wish will never happen , but they just occur .
all of our data have a life cycle .
we must take precautions lest they become ir@@ retri@@ ev@@ able one day .
for example , we can save all the data that we think are important evidence , such as web@@ pages , voice recordings , footage and videos .
and hand over them to our lawyers so as to win our court case .
the problem here is that perhaps not all our evidence is valid .
luckily we now have the cloud digital foren@@ s@@ ics .
we can also rely on the un@@ alter@@ able block@@ chain to make sure that our digital evidence will not be modified and will remain intact .
the combination of the block@@ chain technology and digital foren@@ s@@ ics might give us a safe environment for development at last .
to sum up .
I have spoken of bound@@ ary@@ less protection , supervision on the evidence chain , digital foren@@ s@@ ics , using the graded protection of information security as a rule to regulate companies .
and making digital foren@@ s@@ ics a tool to help us in court .
that &apos;s what I think will happen to data security in future .
as it is developing rapidly .
will quantum computing perhaps offer us a brand @-@ new data @-@ protection method in future ?
hello everyone .
I am Wu Cheng@@ tie .
from Shanghai Institute of Cer@@ am@@ ics , Chinese Academy of Science .
when I received the invitation to speak here a few days ago .
I told my daughter that I was going to give a speech about organ regeneration at Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z A@@ rena .
&quot; what is organ regeneration ? &quot; she asked me .
I told her that human body has many organs .
such as the heart , brain , bones and muscles , which bodily functions rely on .
but suppose one of the organs suffers nec@@ rosis and stops functioning .
I asked my daughter , can we recre@@ ate one ?
she replied , &quot; Dad , are you fool@@ ing me around ?
it &apos;s OK if you are , but promise me you &apos;ll never do that to others . &quot;
and I firmly denied that accusation .
you might have read the novel Inv@@ esti@@ ture Of The Gods .
in it there is a story about Ne@@ zh@@ a and his master .
the immortal Tai@@ Yi Zhen@@ ren .
after Ne@@ zh@@ a committed suicide and his cor@@ po@@ real body vanished .
his master Tai@@ Yi Zhen@@ ren used lotus flowers and roots to construct a human body for his soul .
when I was reading it .
I was amazed by the intelligence of our ancestors .
that smart idea is even beyond imagination in modern times .
just picture it , using lotus flowers and roots to build a human body .
arms and other parts of the body were all born out of lotus .
in this picture on the screen .
Ne@@ zh@@ a was even given six arms and hands in his new body .
by the way , that might facilitate the performance of the famous Chinese dance &quot; Th@@ ous@@ and H@@ ands Guan Yin . &quot;
imagine that in future we might need only one dancer .
rather than dozens , to perform the dance well .
how nice that would be !
but of course I was just joking .
such a dancer , if she really existed , would be a monster .
let &apos;s talk about lotus roots , one of our daily choices for food .
they feature a natural , very neat , porous structure ,
through which the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place .
providing sust@@ enance for the growth of the lotus roots .
that &apos;s an example of how nature makes things work .
now let &apos;s take a look at our human body .
the picture on the right side of the screen displays our bones .
those bones are also characterized by a porous structure .
so what does this structure do here ?
just as with the lotus roots .
the multiple cylindrical channels here can absorb cells and let blood vessels grow inside them .
as we all know , the majority of human organs and tissues have to depend on blood vessels for working .
because blood vessels transport and provide nutrition for them .
so the two pictures on the screen actually indicate how nature and man can be harmon@@ iously united .
given this interesting example of using lotus roots for human body recreation .
I couldn &apos;t help thinking whether we scientists , in our lab , can also recre@@ ate tissues and organs out of lotus .
that would be interesting .
my students were also inspired by Ne@@ zh@@ a &apos;s story .
you see , they can 3D print the &quot; lotus roots &quot; now .
but certainly these are not real lotus roots .
instead , they are made of bio@@ active materials from our lab .
those materials can be used to make &quot; lotus roots &quot; with one , two , three or even four cylindrical channels , whatever the number of cylindrical channels you have in mind .
quite interesting that is , right ?
how amazing 3D printing is .
suppose someone has a skull defect in his head .
we can first record the image of the defect through a scanner and then input it into the computer as a type of data .
based on the data .
we can use some special materials to 3D print a st@@ ent to match and be implanted into his skull defect .
hopefully metal implants will no longer be needed .
for the new @-@ style implant will assimil@@ ate into the man &apos;s skull defect and even help bring about a brand @-@ new skull .
or a new head .
human bones are susceptible to damage under circumstances like traffic accidents or aging @-@ associated diseases .
for example , as we age , we find our bones more brittle .
and there might be problems like oste@@ o@@ proliferation , disability of bone regeneration , and oste@@ o@@ arthritis .
all these problems count among the earliest neuro@@ de@@ generative diseases we might suffer in old age .
if they continue deteriorating .
we might see even a small accidental fall will cause bone fractures .
the reason is that , oste@@ ob@@ lasts in old age are not so active as oste@@ o@@ cl@@ asts .
it &apos;s like the two are playing on a se@@ es@@ aw .
when oste@@ ob@@ lasts fail and fall , oste@@ o@@ cl@@ asts will rise and win .
thereby weakening the bones &apos; regeneration capacity and increasing the possibility of bone fractures .
what can you do with a bone fracture ?
you will go to the hospital .
find a doctor and have a metal plate or long nails inserted into your body .
but the problem is .
what if the nails and metal plates get loose and the fracture is further displaced ?
dragging yourself to the hospital again will be terribly exhausting .
so is there a better way out ?
that &apos;s when 3D printing can come into use .
the skull defects always vary in size , right ?
and their shapes are also different .
in the traditional sub@@ trac@@ tive manufacturing .
it is usually up to mas@@ ons or factories to prepare materials according to different sizes , shapes or dimensions .
but there is not a unified standard ,
for each person has a different standard .
3D printing , however , seems to be more viable under this circumstance .
it can use a certain biological material to create an implant that matches the defect in every detail .
and moreover , the material is also bio@@ degrad@@ able and can be assimil@@ ated by human body ,
unlike the nails and metal plates .
which usually either have to be taken out after several years when the bones fail to work .
or ev@@ oke the immun@@ ological rejection if they stay inside human body and get loose .
this special material will finally be absorbed by our bones and help them restore to an optimal state .
that is kind of like the already @-@ developed limb regeneration .
they are implemented in the same manner .
the entire process is very much like cooking . a vivid metaphor , right ?
3D printing is the way how the chef cooks ,
and the biological material is his cooking materials .
as the saying goes .
&quot; if you have no hand , you can &apos;t make a fist . &quot;
we first have to make our material bio@@ active .
then we have to 3D print it out .
that is our manufacturing method .
when the two factors are perfectly combined .
organs will then be able to be regener@@ ated .
some of us might wonder , are these &quot; lotus roots &quot; placed here just to please our eyes ?
there are so many of them .
the answer is absolutely &quot; No . &quot;
as we all know , humans are made of cells .
cells are very important for us because they give us life , construct the tissues and build our organs .
in this picture on the screen , the green substance around the pore embodies the cells .
which can grow all the way down the cylindrical channels .
what will happen when the cells grow ?
assisted by our biological material .
the cells will divide , and induce the birth of bony tissue and necessary blood vessels .
and they are controllable .
for example , One cylindrical channel might host a certain number of cells which are growing along inside it .
for two cylindrical channels .
the number of such cells will double .
for three , triple .
and for four , quadru@@ ple .
that &apos;s to say . we can control the speed of our organ regeneration by controlling the number of such cells and their speed of division .
let &apos;s look at a picture .
after we place an implant in the human body .
if the implant doesn &apos;t have a cylindrical channel , then only a thin layer around the outer edge turns red .
meaning a small amount of new bony tissue is growing .
rather than a product of human labor , it comes out of itself .
it is our special biological material that finally induc@@ es the generation of the new bony tissue .
the implant in the middle of the picture , however , has one cylindrical channel .
and we can also see some bony tissue emerging .
with three cylindrical channels in place .
just as the right side of the picture shows , a large amount of red substance , or new bony tissue , will come out .
and the edge of the implant also becomes thinner .
can you see that ?
what does that mean ?
it means the material is being absorbed by the human body .
now you might ask .
&quot; Mr. Wu , why are there those newly @-@ born bones ? &quot;
you have said a lot about the result .
but how does every thing work in this process ? &quot;
&quot; as a scientist , surely you have explored into the mechanism ? &quot;
actually we did study the mechanism .
it turned out that not only bones are growing in the cylindrical channel .
as is shown in this picture .
if we insert a 3D printed implant into the rabbit &apos;s leg .
we will see some blue substance emerge in the middle of cylindrical channel .
that is actually the newly @-@ born blood vessels , which are dyed blue here for easier recognition .
many new blood vessels are born in the cylindrical channel under certain induc@@ ement .
it is through these very blood vessels .
W@@ bony tissue grows up , hence the regeneration of our bones .
that &apos;s the first example of organ regeneration I want to talk about today .
here is another example .
more and more people across China and even over the world are being haunted by tumor diseases .
bones , as a very complicated micro @-@ environment .
are especially susceptible to tumors .
why ?
because bones are home to bone marrow cells and stem cells , and tumors in other places of human body will find their way to the bones easily .
for example .
it &apos;s very easy for breast cancer , skin cancer or other kinds of cancers to spread to bones and thus cause bone tumors .
so how are bone tumors clinically treated ?
experience counts a lot here .
I &apos;m not saying that experience is nonsense .
it &apos;s just that some treatment based merely on experience might give luck too much say over someone &apos;s fate .
why am I saying so ?
let &apos;s look at this picture on the left side .
generally doctors will just cut out the bone tumors .
but actually some remnants will remain .
the removal of the bone tumors also har@@ ms the bones , leaving bone defects that might even be irre@@ parable .
so medical metal implants might be needed .
but the problem is .
those implants can &apos;t resist tumors .
the remnant tumor cells will resur@@ rec@@ t and cause bone tumors again .
what can be done about that then ?
doctors will begin prescri@@ bing chemotherapy medications .
which are known for their negative side effects .
such as hair falling out , or even skin loss .
so I keep wondering whether we can do something for that .
can biological materials and 3D printing be introduced into the tumor treatment ?
we have done some research into that .
some biological materials .
as I just mentioned , can help human organs heal .
so can we just incorporate such materials into the tumor treatment , as the picture on the screen shows ?
if someone gets a spinal tumor and has it removed through surgery .
then we can insert a 3D printed implant .
which is made of some material that can kill remnant tumor cells and thus resist tumors , into the bone .
in that manner the defective bone will gradually heal .
how nice that would be !
we all know graph@@ ene .
whose extraction once helped two scientists win a Nobel Prize in Physics .
when combined with 3D printing , it can make up a phot@@ othermal therapy for tumors .
moreover , graph@@ ene , marked by an excellent bio@@ compatibility .
can boost the regeneration of the bony tissue .
what &apos;s more , the phot@@ othermal effect produced by the graph@@ ene implant will kill almost all the tumor cells .
from the picture on the right side you can see that .
the mouse with a 3D printed graph@@ ene implant , after two weeks of treatment .
will see its tumor effectively reduced .
and the implant with phot@@ othermal functionality will also help the defective bone heal .
the treatment of bone fractures thus will evolve from inser@@ ting metal nails or plates to regener@@ ating bones .
what will be the most trendy thing of the 21st century ?
regener@@ ative medicine .
of all the sectors this regener@@ ative medicine might span .
biological materials , 3D printing and organ regeneration will be our major focus .
just imagine , if one day we can print out human organs .
what will happen ?
during a surgery .
the doctors will only need a printer in place , just like the way we work in an office .
whatever organs they need , be it a kidney , a heart or a bone , the doctors can always rely on the printer to offer one as they are doing a surgery .
a beautiful vision it is .
and certainly it &apos;s not impossible .
now we can print bones , teeth and skin .
what more complicated things can we print in future ?
possibly human brains , right ?
can we at last print a human brain ?
that &apos;s our ultimate goal .
human brain regeneration has been listed as a key development program in China &apos;s 13th Five @-@ Year Plan .
and it &apos;s also a global con@@ un@@ drum .
challenging as it might sound .
we are not intim@@ idated by it .
so who is supposed to solve this con@@ un@@ drum in China ?
the Chinese Academy of Science .
the Chinese Academy of Science .
that &apos;s all for my speech today , and thanks for listening .
thank you !
I &apos;m Xian Lin@@ bo .
a former research fellow at Rob@@ o@@ tics Research Center of N@@ anyang Technological University .
I work in Wuhan after I came back home .
we gather together here to learn , communicate , share and look forward to the future .
hoping to lead the world .
you may have come here from your office or your home .
maybe there is a robot assistant in your office who is helping you with some of your s@@ cut work .
maybe you have a robot vacuum cleaner , a window cleaning robot .
and a dish@@ washing robot , and they are helping you with household chores .
these are all the ideal scenes of the future life that we hope to create with human @-@ machine cooperation .
although the workplace has changed .
I use to engage in the research of military human@@ oid robots at N@@ anyang Technological University .
and then I returned to Wuhan to work on service robots .
but there is one thing in common .
how could we make these bi@@ ped robots , wheeled robots , tracked robots , multi @-@ legged robots .
and even robots without legs walk up and down stairs , jump upstairs , and walk on icy roads without falling down ?
how do they assimil@@ ate into human cities , our work and life ?
to help us in production and life .
so as to set us free and help us generate more creativity .
this is the common goal of our robot scientists .
scientists and science fiction writers have one thing in common .
to create and duplicate themselves .
as the smar@@ test pri@@ mates on earth .
we created wheels , steam engines , and internal combustion engines .
however , we hope to duplicate ourselves , our arms and limbs , our looks and our wisdom as the way to pay tribute to nature .
these are the ultimate expressions for us human beings to challenge and rebuild the world .
so how can human@@ oid robots survive for decades ?
and as an individual human being .
do we have any worries ?
what should we do with the robots bomb and the expansion of artificial intelligence ?
as an individual .
I know this will definitely come .
but when will it be ?
will it come silently or in a whirl@@ wind way ?
will it give us time to buffer .
let everyone here learn to grow up .
learn from robots and artificial intelligence .
and even merge with them ?
in the industrial field , which is the most basic production field .
robots have absolute advantages over us .
robots are stronger than humans in terms of strength , handling , pal@@ le@@ tizing , continuous work , energy saving and emission reduction .
even in the assembly that we human beings are proud of , which requires both hands to perform delicate operations .
such as the assembly of lap@@ tops , key@@ boards , mice and mobile phones , intelligent robots with both arms and hands with a camera have replaced it .
these robots are gradually encro@@ aching on our sphere of influence at work .
apart from work , what about everyday life ?
in 20@@ 18 , there will be take @-@ out robots delivering lun@@ ches in buildings .
they would deliver late night sup@@ pers and do express delivery on the road@@ sides .
of course they are still clumsy .
especially the serving robots in restaurants .
I &apos;ve heard friends saying that .
&quot; hey , I went to a robot hot@@ pot restaurant , and they seem to me to be rather mentally retarded robots than intelligent robots ! &quot;
yes , they are still in their immature phase and our worries are totally unnecessary .
they are assimil@@ ating into us , not in a whirl@@ wind way .
but in a process guided by human beings themselves .
taking a further step forward , the instruments .
Board games , calligraphy and paintings in the art field have already been figured out by robots .
although their skills still need improvement .
I think the robot defe@@ ating the human Go player is old news .
now , it would be news if a human Go player wins over the robot .
just a few days ago .
K@@ e Jie took revenge on AI F@@ ine@@ Art with 72 moves .
however , how long will this success last ?
maybe next time AI will win again .
looking at this situation , intelligent robots will definitely invade our sphere of influence gradually to take over some of our work .
which causes un@@ eas@@ iness and fright in us as the most intelligent pri@@ mates .
but this un@@ eas@@ iness can be turned into another form of power .
we possess in@@ comparable creativity and learning ability .
we can regard ourselves as a simple robot , a robot with man @-@ machine cooperation , and even a robot with man @-@ machine integration .
for example .
in the military field and the field of medical rehabilitation , the ex@@ os@@ k@@ elet@@ on , intelligent artificial limb , intelligent eye@@ ball and heart may all become part of the intelligent equipment embedded into our body .
we can only embrace such changes .
however , what led to all this ?
some people say laziness is the greatest driving force for our scientific and technological progress .
we want convenience .
so we build cars .
we want to see more of the world .
so we create teles@@ copes
we want more laughter and a life at ease .
we leave what we don &apos;t want to do to robots .
and we shall continue to communicate , learn , look forward to and lead the future of the world .
but to put it simply .
in the past hundreds of years .
we have given away work that is demanding , troublesome and labor@@ ious and that we humans wouldn &apos;t like to do .
for example , in the age of steam .
we replaced the hand@@ loom with a steam locomotive .
which can be considered as a case of machine replacing people .
in the era of electrical appliances .
electric machines are replacing us to take up our work .
in the information age .
computer @-@ controlled electric machines are taking over our work .
we found that people still have a role to play in the first three er@@ as .
but how about in the era of intelligence ?
the young people in our team , the post @-@ 80 and 90 generations .
who are the digital natives , asked me why we have to work .
I don &apos;t want to work .
I just want to have fun .
I want to break free .
let &apos;s take cars as an example .
petroleum , chemical industry , and smel@@ ting make our cars run faster , save more energy and have higher efficiency .
making us safer and more comfortable .
automobiles have become our second home and our most important personal property after real estate .
of course , not for those here who have yach@@ ts and private planes .
can robots become our second movable assets in the future ?
cars work outside the house , robots work at home .
however , all of you who come here today still need to drive by yourselves with your hands holding the steering wheel .
on the jammed roads in Shanghai , Wuhan , Beijing and Shenzhen .
you will spend two to three hours on commu@@ ting .
in other words .
in the first three er@@ as , the steam engine , the internal combustion engine , the motor , and the control system were replaced .
these are just to make cars become better , to enhance the physical strength of the car .
but it still won &apos;t liberate ourselves .
however , the era of intelligence has liberated us .
a dri@@ ver@@ less car will take me from the starting point to the destination just like a mobile robot , saving time and creativity .
that is why everyone says that the changes brought about by the age of intelligence are far ahead of the previous three er@@ as .
they are great releases to ourselves , productivity and creativity .
is there anything else besides cars ?
of course there is .
the Asian Heart Hospital in Wuhan is planning a new hospital construction .
they have reserved special elev@@ ators for robots and special passages for robot nurses .
passages in some large @-@ scale warehouses and residential areas have been reserved for robots to patrol and tour .
in 20@@ 18 , food delivery robots are sure to enter our lives .
robot nurses can reduce the conflicts between doctors and patients .
reduce the time for patients to obtain medicines .
and save time for patients waiting for surgery in the operating room to obtain surgical materials and clothing .
not only cars .
intelligent robots are engaging in more scenes of our lives .
this process is slow and steady , irreversible .
but it progresses silently .
when we find it out , we don &apos;t need to do it .
we just need a robot .
what shall we do ?
we shouldn &apos;t feel sad .
what we give up is what we don &apos;t want to do .
what we don &apos;t want , and what we must give up .
they have three common features : dull , D@@ ir@@ ty , Dangerous .
they are repetitive boring labor work day after day and year after year .
dirty and ti@@ ring work , dusty work .
polluted work and dangerous work have gradually been replaced by various robots .
the most dangerous things are deep sea exploration , emergency rescue , and life @-@ threatening wars and military affairs .
according to statistics at the end of 20@@ 17 .
there are already more than 60 countries in the world , equipped with more than 150 kinds of military robots .
far exceeding the types of our factories .
Russia announced that by 20@@ 25 .
70 % of the soldiers commanded by its general will be human beings and 30 % robots .
the United States has set a goal of 1 : 1 between human soldiers and robot soldiers by 20@@ 25 .
in other words , 8 to 10 years later .
the battlefield commanders and generals are commanding a man @-@ machine cooperative force .
how to lead them ?
how to direct them to win one strategy and tactics after another ?
robots are not dangerous , nor is the artificial intelligence .
what is dangerous is what they are used for and how we take advantage of them .
danger always lies in our heart .
and ignoring such changes and trends is the root cause of danger .
let &apos;s take a look at the generals &apos; eyes , ears , sni@@ pers and their right @-@ hand men .
after receiving the instructions , a group of unmanned fire@@ power assault vehicles quickly gather under the control of the intelligent system and disperse to hide in time .
they suddenly appear from the same place and focus their fire@@ power on enemies at the same time .
how do we gather our corporate resources ?
considering the people , finance and materials in a rapidly changing market .
we shall concentrate our fire@@ power and advantages instead of manpower .
it &apos;s no use having too many people to win one war after another .
there is also a right @-@ hand man that assists the general and completes important tasks .
which is a long @-@ distance transportation unmanned vehicle from Carnegie M@@ ell@@ on University .
as long as you tell it the starting point and the destination .
it will complete the tasks with full autonomy and full intelligence .
you don &apos;t need to worry about the whole process of transporting intelligence , materials or even the keys and passwords of nuclear bombs .
my dear friends , do you have such an assistant ?
can we train such an assistant ?
in China &apos;s inner lakes .
our unmanned fleet can achieve autonomous intelligent cruise .
in important sites along the lake .
it can complete the unmanned cru@@ ising on the water surface , in the air and underwater .
let &apos;s guess how far this two @-@ meter long robot can swim .
3000 to 5000 kilometers .
it &apos;s only two meters long .
it makes full use of the ocean currents and the layer of the rock strata , and moves like a gli@@ der in the water .
so we figur@@ atively called it &quot; underwater gli@@ der . &quot;
looking at the news .
we know that in September last year .
we had an exercise in the South China Sea .
our fishermen accidentally caught one .
of course , we gave it away .
but the next day .
a national conference on underwater gli@@ ders was held at Harbin Institute of Technology .
less than 8 hours .
from the South China Sea to Harbin .
our organizational response speed was so fast .
could a general act as fast as this does ?
when our front@@ line marketing team discovers the target .
can we achieve the integration of reconnaissance and strike like Wing Lo@@ ong ?
do we give them enough authority ?
do we have to report to our superi@@ ors only because they lack sen@@ iority ?
robots already possess the integrated reconnaissance and attack capabilities and can combat the enemies the moment they spot them .
how do our organizations cope with this change ?
how to keep up with the general ?
faced with the constantly changing battlefield knowledge .
the air defense system , consisting of four to six dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles .
can provide air defense for a regiment .
it uses the laser beam as a weapon to combat the incoming missiles , bombs and any other obstacles .
do you have a last line of defense like this ?
that is , when a war takes place .
there is always an iron army that combat enemies with us .
humans are strange animals .
we head for the war with our highest wisdom and strongest bodies .
of course , in other words , it is to ensure our collective safety .
we blu@@ bber since we &apos;re born . we have a strong sense of insecurity and we pursue security .
what would happen after our security is guaranteed ?
with the development of the agricultural and biological technologies .
we are satisfied with the basic necessities of our life .
we &apos;re largely satisfied with the safety , health and our basic demands are met with the development of the modern science and technology .
after safety is guaranteed by the army .
the general has already begun to manage the armies composed of both humans and robots .
now , humans and robot bands can perform together on the stage .
faced with these changes .
do you think enterprises respond slower than generals and performers ?
what can we do ?
although it is slow in reacting
as for post @-@ 8@@ 0s and 9@@ 0s employees , after their basic needs are satisfied .
they long for self @-@ actu@@ alization .
they want to be a sni@@ per , a right @-@ hand man , your eyes and ears .
and they want to be your iron armies .
how do we organize and manage ?
more importantly .
are you ready to manage an organization with both humans and robots in cooperation 10 years later ?
maybe you &apos;re enlarging the factories .
have you planned channels for robots to make inspection patrols and tours ?
maybe you &apos;re furn@@ ishing new offices .
have you planned charging ports and space for those little robots that do deliveries ?
the era of intelligence has already come and the biggest danger is to ignore it .
to create a promising future .
be prepared to manage both people and robots .
in the next 10 years of business war .
care for every human employees and help very little robot so that we could win this war .
thank you .
hello everyone !
I am Ren M@@ in from En@@ act@@ us .
En@@ act@@ us is a global non @-@ profit organization .
and we provide services to college students from all over the world .
in China , we have led groups of post @-@ 8@@ 5@@ s , post @-@ 9@@ 0s , and post @-@ 9@@ 5@@ S to discover themselves , find themselves and their real driving force for innovation through project @-@ based learning for 16 years .
I participated in an En@@ act@@ us project for the first time in 2003 .
in 2006 .
I was assigned to pioneer the Chinese market on behalf of En@@ act@@ us .
therefore , in the past 15 years .
on this platform , I have known and made friends with generations of ambitious and wonderful young people .
the topic I &apos;d like to share with you today is the leadership of the new generation in the digital age .
the industrial revolution and the invention of the steam engine brought us into an era of the great development of mechan@@ ization .
the Internet revolution and the information explosion in this digital age have taken us into an all @-@ inclusive era of reform and information .
what are the characteristics of the digital natives who grew up in this era ?
their first characteristic is about the high speed .
they are a generation who looks for novelty and swif@@ tness .
they grew up with the Internet and learn from it by os@@ mos@@ is .
stimulated by a variety of high @-@ intensity and diversified Internet media .
they can penetrate more keenly and dig into various current affairs and political hot spots more quickly than any other age groups of our generation .
in this process , they are not only the most sensitive generation that collects fastest information .
but also the generation that can grasp , use and diffuse information in the fastest way .
here is an example .
to make a call for someone ( to cheer for someone ) , an aid culture originated from live concerts in Japan .
under the understanding of our new generation , quickly made an internal transformation .
they use it in various online shows that went viral in summer and in their daily buzz words .
our new generation is leading our Internet slang culture in the fastest speed .
here is another example .
how many of you were still playing Honor of Kings in July and August ?
then in October and November .
more people gathered together for PU@@ B@@ G .
then in January of 20@@ 18 .
there were more people with their eyes glued to their phones while having dinner , and they would play quiz games like Knowledge Super@@ man and Chong@@ ding Con@@ test .
in the past two weeks .
lots of people posted &quot; husbands , &quot; namely their travel frog , in We@@ Chat moments for no apparent reasons .
being a post @-@ 8@@ 0s generation , sometimes I feel quite lost .
why do I feel lost ?
I realize that in such an era , our young people are facing a variety of strong stimulus .
their concerns and interests are constantly changing .
things can be highly stimulating , bud@@ d@@ ha @-@ like , fast @-@ paced or arbitrary .
this fast change makes me suddenly realize that this is the new generation we are facing now .
it snow@@ ed heavily yesterday .
I went to pick up my kid from school .
that was the first time I had seen how children of generation @-@ z studied .
they listened to music with ear@@ phones in their ears , took their mobile phones out occasionally to check on their frogs .
looked at computer screens and talked about Q@@ Q zones .
while doing their math and Chinese homework .
their ability to continuously switch information sources .
their ability to adapt to changes and their ability to process multit@@ asking information at the same time really make me , a post @-@ 8@@ 0s generation , realize that this is the generation we &apos;re going to face in the future .
a generation that asks for quick@@ ness and novelty .
the second feature I &apos;d like to share with you is &quot; black . &quot;
what does &quot; black &quot; mean ?
it is not about their appearance .
but the black technology .
as a new generation that grows with the Internet .
they have an indigenous reverence for science and technology .
on the one hand , they have higher requirements for Internet tools .
it is difficult for them to accept tools that lag in response or have various bugs .
on the other hand , they are fast learners .
they have a natural sense of challenge , a natural desire of learning , a natural motive and motivation to try any new Internet tool .
En@@ act@@ us organizes a big competition every year .
in this competition .
we ask every college student team to show their projects in the most current , fun and interesting way .
from my observation , normally the lead cre@@ ators of each display team are not specialized in the design , multimedia or visual presentation .
but they are self @-@ taught based on their own interests and challenges .
such as A@@ wen and Qian Ji@@ aw@@ en shown on P@@ PT .
both of them are popular public figures in the P@@ PT field and have more than 200,000 fans .
they both learn and master internet tools based on their interests in this .
there is another example .
Zhang Z@@ iling , a post @-@ 95 colleague from our office who does marketing .
the organizing committee of Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u Talk told me that the presentation tool we are going to use today is Key@@ note and I should prepare the photos and text and send them the archive .
that &apos;s what I briefed Z@@ iling .
after hearing this , Z@@ iling responded directly .
I &apos;d rather learn it myself and make it by myself instead of spending time communicating with others .
so it merely took him two weeks to present all the keynote content that I showed you today .
I went to check my computer .
it might look like this .
then I went to look at the computers of post @-@ 9@@ 0s and post @-@ 9@@ 5@@ S in our office .
this is how they look like .
why is there such a huge difference ?
because they have the passion , mastery and super confidence for the black technology and Internet tools .
in my days .
the way I came into contact with computers is to put on shoe covers and enter the computer room .
we sat there .
and then the teacher told me how to turn on the computer .
how to turn it off .
and how to open the Word and Exc@@ el .
on the contrary , the new generation now are the genuine natives .
they have access to iP@@ ads .
smart phones and various electronic tools the moment they are born .
they learn through active learning and exploration process that is based on their interests , hobbies and curiosity .
rather than the process of passive learning .
so one is passive , and the other is active .
one is deficient , and the other is sufficient .
people growing up in two different environments naturally shows different confidence in the application of Internet tools .
the last feature is that our new generation cares for themselves a lot .
they speak from the bottom of their hearts for their personal opinions and self @-@ expression .
currently , there are various tools on our platform , including videos , live broadcasts , texts and so on .
all of which provide the new generation with more channels to make their voice heard , to show themselves , to be recognized and to receive feedback from the outside world .
I have another example for you .
a month ago , in December , we attempted to launch a contest called &quot; Campus Re@@ ds Con@@ test . &quot;
we also wanted to know to what extent college students want to be famous .
in fact , under the very limited publicity and distribution channels , and since the brand impression of En@@ act@@ us before actually takes the commercial practice and public welfare practice as the prerequisite .
many students enthusiastically signed up and showed support .
in just one week .
we had more than 2 million views .
in this process .
we saw that college students have different ways of making their voices heard .
some people said they wanted to show their photography skills .
some said they wanted to show their knowledge of Chinese language and culture .
and some college students said that they wanted to show that they were a model .
some said that they wanted to be an influ@@ encer , etc .
all in all , everyone &apos;s needs are different .
but everyone needs a platform to be recognized , acknowledged and seen .
okay .
so we are facing a new generation like this .
what should organizations and Bos@@ ses do ?
one of my immediate thoughts at this moment is , since I am a post @-@ 8@@ 0s .
if there is no obstacle for me to lead and communicate with the post @-@ 8@@ 0s generation , then I shall ask the post @-@ 9@@ 0s generation .
I will ask the post @-@ 9@@ 0s entrepreneurs how they lead their teams .
I interviewed about a dozen entrepreneurs that belong to the post @-@ 9@@ 0s generation .
in fact , the answer they gave me was identical to the M@@ U train theory of imagination .
what is that ?
the way the present post @-@ 9@@ 0s lead the post @-@ 9@@ 0s is not like the old green train .
which has a locomotive with a superpower and super engine , and then drives all the way with the cars behind it .
it &apos;s not like this .
now the way the present post @-@ 9@@ 0s lead the post @-@ 9@@ 0s is that we hope that every post @-@ 9@@ 0s and every new generation can become a powerful train car driven by their own energy , fully powered .
and all of us will work hard to move forward together .
let &apos;s look at a few cases .
the first case is &quot; Let@@ s@@ draw . &quot;
this young man studied Finance which has nothing to do with visual communication and computer .
in the interview , I asked him .
how do you understand leadership and how do you lead your post @-@ 9@@ 0s bud@@ dies ?
he told me that he attributes it to empathy .
I found a market pain point with empathy .
the pain point is that my new generation bud@@ dies told me .
why is it so difficult for me to make hand @-@ drawn videos ?
why don &apos;t we have a tool like P@@ PT to draw videos by hand ?
so I realized this is a market requirement .
and I need to meet this requirement .
similarly , I also came close to every post @-@ 9@@ 0s friend of mine with empathy .
he is now leading 150 employees .
I try to understand their thoughts , ang@@ ers and sorrows .
for example , in what kind of environment and after what kind of events do you think the cohesion of your organization is the best .
and everyone &apos;s performance is the best ?
he said it was after the team building .
I asked , what do you do for team building ?
he told me that they would pick a working day .
rent a beautiful and luxurious villa or book a five @-@ star hotel and stay there for two days .
I was really shocked by this .
as a post @-@ 8@@ 0s , what I think of team building is to arrange some training .
and it is best not to interfere with working hours .
however , his case of team building pushed me to ask more other post @-@ 9@@ 0s entrepreneurs .
their answers were basically the same .
this is the difference caused by the lack of empathy between the two generations .
what we do for team building may not really be favored by our new generation friends .
the second example is What@@ You@@ Need .
there are five founders .
they are all 24 @-@ year @-@ old college graduates .
what they did is that hey created a new media account called What@@ You@@ Need .
basically , each of their articles has more than 100,000 views .
and the activities they organize have been widely responded to and recognized by youngsters .
when I interviewed their editor @-@ in @-@ chief , he told me that they think the most important thing is to create a culture in the office that allows everyone to speak freely and emphasizes efficient cooperation .
we even make changes for trivial things such as the arrangement of furniture .
we felt that long tables hinder equal speech and would lead to a sense of authority and inequality .
so we replaced it with round tables and square tables .
we also encourage our staff to share their thoughts and creative ideas anytime and anywhere .
and any one of them could be the leader of the next project .
this is the inspiration from What@@ You@@ Need .
the last example is from Hu Jia@@ wei .
he has turned the topic of sex education for children .
which we think can only be made into public welfare projects .
into a social enterprise that takes into account both business and social influence .
I was shocked to know that .
in the post @-@ 9@@ 0s world , a topic like this can be made into a business .
I asked , how did you make it ?
he said , I did not study education .
and I haven &apos;t had much experience or even had no practical experience in education before I embarked on this career .
however , I recognized the wide social influence and value of the topic of children &apos;s sex education in China .
I recognized my fast learning ability .
and I can skillfully take advantage of the capacity of Internet communication .
I think I can give it a try .
therefore , he carries his own dream and his own sense of value .
each of his articles has more than 100,000 views .
and he also does a live broadcast of children &apos;s sex education at the same time , which has more than 200,000 views .
two hundred thousand parents are willing to go on the live broadcast platform at the same time to listen to Hu Jia@@ wei &apos;s team talking about children &apos;s sex education .
and he developed a series of products .
including cartoon books , videos , derivatives , toys that are all about this topic .
he told me that .
it was this sense of mission and value that drove him to move forward and to make it an enterprise with both commercial and social values .
what the young leaders told me may sound familiar , ordinary and simple , however , their words stress out the necessity of a mechanism that consist of trust , respect , listening and open communication .
they attach importance on timely and open recognition , stimulation of innovation , in @-@ time guidance and tracking as well as feedback .
it sounds like we post @-@ 8@@ 0s generation does the same thing , right ?
then why do we often have all kinds of conflicts , explicit or implicit , in our work from time to time ?
after studying the way the post @-@ 9@@ 0s lead the post @-@ 9@@ 0s .
what we need to reflect on is .
why can &apos;t we do it well ?
or why do we encounter so many barriers when we do it ?
let &apos;s think about what advantages our generation has .
I think social resources , professional ability and industry insights are obviously our advantages .
however , on the basis of this advantage .
we often fall into a puzzling or subconscious inter@@ gener@@ ational superiority .
because we think we have something that you don &apos;t have .
so I must be better than you .
although sometimes we don &apos;t show it evidently .
but when we have a meeting , when we communicate with the new generation .
we have more or less an attitude that make young people think that we are looking down on them .
we talk and communicate with them with a sense of superiority .
at that time , what we can get is either resistance or compromise , or the kind of acceptance that is reluctant .
and they won &apos;t talk about it .
of course .
we have also witnessed more post @-@ 7@@ 0s and post @-@ 8@@ 0s leaders becoming more open @-@ minded , more curious and more willing to come into contact with our new generation .
at this moment , we may consider trying the travel frog .
learning Internet buzz words used by youngsters , and making friends with them !
but what was the reply we got ?
let &apos;s think about our new generation &apos;s reply to us .
basically , they will give you no attention and ignore you .
or they will reluctantly stay with you for just a while .
next time when you ask him for dinner , He wouldn &apos;t even come .
why ?
it is because we don &apos;t cater to them .
this kind of deliberate catering and pleasing cannot meet their inner needs .
this is only superficial efforts .
it will make them feel it &apos;s like a toxic relationship .
I desperately go after someone and please someone .
but usually , what I get is rejection , strang@@ eness , and &quot; leave me alone . &quot;
so what I want to say is that each generation holds its own attitude , views and advantages .
in fact , what we need to do is , on the one hand , stick to ourselves and believe in ourselves .
on the other hand , we will create an ecology of integration .
and we will create an ecology based on the integration of our two generations .
we hope that the next two generations can become two magne@@ ts that have their own advantages , attitudes and opinions , and can attract and integrate with each other .
this is what we hope to achieve .
we hope that we live the present together with our new generation .
make changes and create a better future together !
thank you all !
good afternoon , everyone .
I &apos;m Qi Jun@@ yuan from Te@@ ambition .
to begin with , I &apos;d like to ask you guys a simple question .
what is the most distinctive ability of human beings ?
maybe gossi@@ ping ?
people do a good job at gossi@@ ping , and everyone loves gossi@@ ping .
just joking , but seriously .
the discussion today is about collaboration , which is also a summary of my reflections over the years of experience in collaboration tools .
well , first of all .
let &apos;s start with one &apos;s top ability .
I &apos;m most proud of , or ra@@ ther@@ . my persistent motivation to get up everyday is that we human as a race are really achieving prodi@@ gious fe@@ ats constantly .
actually , we have sent people to the moon in the 1960s .
and I happened to hear of the dream held and told by the new Chief Scienti@@ st of NASA recently .
who is in charge of the overall research and development of New Hor@@ iz@@ ons .
he has seen people discussing how the United States sent people to the moon and how human beings became a multi @-@ star race from childhood .
and was so inspired by the story that he further del@@ ved into the career .
it took him 20 years to launch New Hor@@ iz@@ ons from Earth , And New Hor@@ iz@@ ons achieved Pluto fly@@ by last year to further explore the universe .
this is a miracle , as so many others the mankind is working on , And then , what &apos;s behind ?
why can humans achieve these ?
this is what the American president Kennedy concluded .
he said , &quot; I believe this nation can go all out to attain the goal together .
it is so hard that we &apos;d never thought of it , seen it , did it , or even imagined it .
yet we can make it , because we can unite as one . &quot;
this is , in effect , the most essential skill of human beings - collaboration .
we are the only race that can achieve a goal through mass collaboration with depth perception instead of working alone .
this is also why we have come so far .
while our &quot; P@@ each &quot; may just stroll downstairs every day .
this is the essence .
we continuously move forward , hand in hand .
and collaboration is the essential skill , a talent , of human beings .
why is that so ?
this may still be a bit abstract .
so let &apos;s break it up again and take a look at what collaboration is all about .
in fact , it has a lot to do with the point - everyone can gossip .
one of man &apos;s basic skills is telling stories .
what we like to hear most from our childhood is stories .
and what we are good at is telling one story after another for people around .
many are fictional and based on other &apos;s imagination .
but what makes people special is that when listening to stories .
we can imagine as well .
we can imagine the same story .
and also feel the ill@@ us@@ ory and imaginary goal and vision they dreamed of .
in this process .
those who can tell stories remarkably well gather people around .
so many people are moved by these fictional stories and inspired by a same dream .
that they are willing to strive for it in the best days of life .
thus people are gathered , working together for a fictional story .
and this is collaboration .
now it seems each and every one of us is meant for collaboration .
indeed , collaboration is the process of a group achieving common goals .
but what &apos;s more , it is a basic talent of we human race .
for example .
we all know W@@ IK@@ IP@@ ED@@ IA , or maybe Baidu Bai@@ ke .
such ency@@ clo@@ pedia sites .
Wiki@@ pedia , for example , actually has more than 30 million pieces of knowledge and information .
as regards the explanation of different keywords .
each piece may have rich an@@ tec@@ ed@@ ents , consequences and developments .
moreover , this collaboration does not require education .
we did not achieve it for any kind of education or training received .
rather , we accomplished it spontaneously .
we spontaneously engage in such a dream .
a fictional fantasy as well as a vision with the inspiration that human beings need an ency@@ clo@@ pedia for our own .
this happens so often , and you may take my word .
collaboration is an inherent talent of humans .
well , that &apos;s collaboration ,
our first key point .
then let &apos;s talk about organizations .
since here comes many HR@@ Ds .
leaders or members of enterprises today ,
the word &quot; organization &quot; may be simply read as the enterprise one comes from .
in fact , however , as we sit together here for exchanges , sharing and interaction today .
we are actually an organization .
an organization is formed so long as we gather and do something for a common goal .
which is especially comprehensible for an enterprise .
what was the enterprise like in the past ?
we described enterprises as &quot; strictly organized &quot; too often , right ?
clearly structured , specifically regulated , and explicitly aimed with steps 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 @-@ 4 @-@ 5 .
but today &apos;s enterprises are actually undergoing huge changes .
and likewise , such organizations as various learning communities today are changing tremendously .
it is especially evident that a system of clear structure has gradually evolved into a mes@@ hed system .
one more comfortable and natural , and within which we are more like experiencing a life process or attending a friend &apos;s gathering .
such feelings are never rare , and are all brought by organizations today .
I see that you have certain doubts , and may argue that the company you work in doesn &apos;t seem like this .
but never mind . this is the trend .
still , what &apos;s behind ?
after careful analysis , my opinion is that
technology em@@ powers and materi@@ alizes the changes of our organizations .
let me give you some examples .
there are some key words .
the first called &quot; bound@@ ary@@ less . &quot;
major technologies today have re@@ modeled our business .
many long tail business models , which are hard to imagine before , cannot possibly exist .
because our business chain was not that long previously .
but today , with the help of many information technologies .
our business chain can be really long .
we may touch our customers at one end , and make a profit from one of their relatives and friends far away .
the business model is extended and this kind of long tail effect increasingly bl@@ urs the boundary between enterprises .
when describing an enterprise .
we focus more on the attractiveness and value of its ecology these days , and rarely on the result .
I &apos;m not repudi@@ ating that enterprises must endeavor to create value for their customers , which is definitely right .
however , enterprise boundary has become less clear .
this further changes the organization of an enterprise .
next , &quot; decentralization . &quot;
so , what is &quot; decentralization &quot; ?
we tend to think of our enterprises with a top leader .
whom we listen to and believe in completely .
and this is prevailing and essential among enterprises in the past .
why ?
because an enterprise or organization exists to meet a goal , a common goal requiring group effort .
and only in this way , the enterprise can then succeed .
it &apos;s difficult to ensure that all information inside an enterprise is seam@@ lessly syn@@ ced formerly .
while we often found information from one source mis@@ matching with the task assigned from another ,
which means information out of syn@@ c can occur quite frequently in previous enterprises .
information synchronization can be easily realized via various communication tools nowadays .
enterprises are gradually decentralized with the easy transmission of true information regarding enterprise goals .
the actual situation may be that the information necessary for task completion is more from a mes@@ hed information link in spite of the many ways to acquire the right task information .
this is decentralization .
last , &quot; agility . &quot;
the word &quot; agility &quot; is hard to comprehend .
we get our job done more in a project based manner nowadays than breaking down into a tree pattern as before .
as we often team up temporarily to solve a problem together .
you may notice that new small teams are constantly formed for specific matters while our organizational structure remains unchanged in a large enterprise .
this is enabled by such tools as We@@ Chat , of which the group building feature easily produces many small groups .
these combined with bound@@ ary@@ less and decentralization mentioned before .
make a natural and mes@@ hed structure for the enterprises .
now , have you noticed their relationship with collaboration ?
does it seem that today &apos;s enterprises are inherently collaborative ?
in fact , it is .
as technology em@@ powers people .
we are closer and closer to the one we want and meant to be .
we are far less restricted by the outside , or by our own ability .
the ability of individuals of humans as a special group .
and instead , we have many abilities to release our talents , including collaboration .
so , here comes the key question - Is this good or not ?
you may question if our enterprises today , net@@ worked , non @-@ hierarchical and dynamic as such , are less disciplined , less likely to fight for a common goal .
or are no longer vital .
to answer this question , rigorous scientific studies are needed .
the good thing is that technology em@@ powers us again .
data generated from various collaborative , communication and enterprise tools enable us to cor@@ relate it with the enterprise performance and train it by means of machine learning .
and thus we have an insight as to whether actions of employees , or individuals of an organization .
or the organization as a whole have enhanced or impaired our performance .
from our studies along with scientists .
here is an achievement in relation to sales I &apos;d like to share to support my opinions today .
why this one ?
because people always take sales performance as immediate and easily measurable for the profits for a company .
besides , we used to take it for granted that sales depends more on personal ability to gain customers and obtain orders .
so as to create value for the company .
it seems that what kind of person one is and whether one can cooperate well with colleagues is not necessarily critical .
and the key is how one cooper@@ ates with customers .
on the contrary , however .
our findings show that the performance of a salesperson is directly related to his or her attribute of collaboration and coordination with others .
and the collaborative model of sales@@ persons can account for over 40 % of the performance difference directly .
that is , a salesperson good at dealing with different internal departments and collaborating with various colleagues is more likely to achieve high performance .
now it &apos;s actually quite easy for us to perceive my previous opinions with this insight .
products and services of all enterprises today are in dynamic change and enable us to constantly provide customers with better stuff and services .
better performance is assured if a good salesperson can easily integrate the best resources of a company to serve the customer .
which is easy to explain revers@@ ely .
yet , collaboration can indeed promote performance , and this is quite good .
still , concerning sales , we can notice some specific practices of relatively advanced enterprises .
that are very interesting .
they do not emphasize a highly collaborative culture created or comprehension of collaboration required for sales colleagues .
they simply form a project @-@ based sales pattern .
specific project teams are naturally formed to serve each customer .
and this spontaneously rein@@ forces the collaborative nature and thus works .
finally , let &apos;s look at the topic we are most concerned today - What is the best leadership in the digital age ?
what exactly is leadership ?
what is it for ?
leadership is exercised for the team to attain goals and is best demonstrated by telling a good story and then make it true together .
hence in leadership today , collaborative thinking is more employed for us to share a great story and realize goals in joint effort .
re@@ shaping our leadership and team in this way can definitely realize one amazing goal after another .
that being the case and day by day , the human race is better .
and our society more with a sense of purpose , and increasingly worthy of enjoying .
that &apos;s all .
thank you very much !
my name is Chen Tian , and I am a researcher of Chinese traditional opera .
today , I &apos;m very happy to have this opportunity to talk with you about the cross @-@ gender performance in opera .
firstly , I want to know , are there any opera fans in the audience ?
Oh yeah , there is , and thank you for coming !
well , maybe some of you are not opera fans but that &apos;s OK , because I believe we all know Mr. Mei Lan@@ fang .
well , this is a still of Mei Lan@@ fang in the Peking opera , The D@@ run@@ ken Beauty .
and these two pictures are also Mei Lan@@ fang &apos; sti@@ l@@ ls .
the left one is F@@ airy Gi@@ ves F@@ lowers to The Earth and it is a new opera type with ancient clothing .
the right one is Un@@ matched Marriage and it is a new opera type with fashionable dress .
Mr. Mei played Dan role .
the roles he has played are all female roles .
Mei Lan@@ fang ranks first among the four famous male characters in Beijing opera and the other three are Cheng Yan@@ qi@@ u , Shang Xiao@@ yun and Xun Hu@@ ish@@ eng .
have you ever thought about this problem ?
why are the four famous D@@ ans all male ?
if a man plays the female role or a woman plays the male role .
this is what we call cross @-@ gender performance .
in operas , they are often called &quot; Qian Dan K@@ un Sheng . &quot;
Qian refers to the male and K@@ un refers to the female .
it should be said that cross @-@ gender performance is not unique to traditional Chinese operas .
we can find examples in different theatrical styles , classical and modern , Chinese and foreign .
for example , in the Elizabeth age of Britain , the male actors played the female roles .
so we can imagine that in the opera performance of Shakespeare &apos;s Romeo and Juli@@ et .
there are actually two beautiful young male actors who played the love story and the deed of committing suicide on the stage .
that is really good news for the girls who like love stories between men !
well , why was Juli@@ et played by a male actor ?
the answer is very simple .
because there were no act@@ resses in the professional theatrical trou@@ pe at that time , and the trou@@ pes were consisted of all men .
today we may only discuss cross @-@ gender performance as an artistic issue .
but from the historical perspective .
cross @-@ gender performance is not the choice of art .
but the requirements of gender norms of the society .
the same is true for Chinese opera .
especially in the Ming and Qing Dynasties when the gender segregation system in opera art became more strict .
the joint performance of men and women was considered immoral .
so the professional and family trou@@ pes at that time usually adopted the form of all @-@ male or all @-@ female actors .
if you have read the classics , A Dream of Red Man@@ sions , you may be impressed that all family trou@@ pes in Jia family are consisted of female performers .
but the professional actors Jia Bao@@ yu makes acquaintance with in society are male actors .
so cross @-@ gender performance was a common phenomenon at that time .
then in the Qing Dynasty , when Peking opera came into being .
we can know that women were also excluded from professional trou@@ pes .
the government has repeatedly banned women from performing opera and even from going to the theatres .
there were no act@@ resses in the trou@@ pes , but on the stage we couldn &apos;t only perform so @-@ called men &apos;s plays .
even if people always played typical male @-@ narrative works such as Rom@@ ance of the Three King@@ doms and The Water Mar@@ gin .
yet there still needed actors to play Pan Jin@@ lian and Di@@ ao Chan .
therefore , the trou@@ pes chose males playing the female roles .
let &apos;s look at this picture .
it is Thir@@ teen Opera Masters of Tong@@ guang Period , which depicts the 13 most famous actors in Beijing city during the Tong@@ zhi and Guang@@ x@@ u periods in the Qing Dynasty .
they are all men , but in this picture , there are six actors playing female roles .
we can see that the third person from the left , with a bright and glowing face looking like a full moon , is Mei Qi@@ a@@ oling .
he was the master of the Si@@ xi Com@@ bo and the grandfather of Mei Lan@@ fang .
so , in such a gender @-@ segre@@ gated society environment , Peking opera has formed a male @-@ centered feature of male actors performing for men .
it was not until the end of the Qing Dynasty that such a situation in which men dominated the opera performance began to change .
because at that time the imperial ban was difficult to be carried out in the concessions .
therefore , act@@ resses in Shanghai and Tianjin began to act on the stage .
at first , the trou@@ pes were divided by gender .
however , after the Republic of China , there gradually appeared a trend of co @-@ acting between men and women .
that is to say , actors and act@@ resses played roles of the same sex according to their physiological gender .
however , in the common people &apos;s view at that time .
when it comes to Dan role in Peking opera , people prefer male Dan and think male Dan represents the highest performance level .
so in 19@@ 27 .
SH@@ UN@@ T@@ I@@ AN Times selected four famous Dan roles .
all of whom were men .
but we call them the Four Fam@@ ous Dan Rol@@ es .
not the Four Fam@@ ous Qian Dan Rol@@ es .
in turn , in 1930 , The Pe@@ i Yang Pic@@ torial News selected four act@@ resses .
they are Hu Bil@@ an , Meng Li@@ jun , Zhang E &apos;@@ yun and X@@ ue Yan@@ q@@ in .
on the contrary , they were called the Four Fam@@ ous K@@ un Dan Rol@@ es , which was actually a concept at that time .
of course , cross @-@ gender performances are found in many local operas .
but as for the most influential characters in opera which have formed a kind of institutionalized performance .
that is probably female Xia@@ os@@ h@@ eng in Yue opera besides male Dan roles in Peking Opera .
the historical background of the formation of Yue opera is different from that of Peking Opera .
if I am allowed to say so arbitrarily .
the male Dan in Peking opera is the product of male drama culture .
while female Xia@@ os@@ h@@ eng in Yue opera is the product of female drama culture .
Yue opera is a local opera from Sheng County , Zhejiang Province .
at first , it was also performed by all male actors .
well , let &apos;s see this picture . he is Bai Yu@@ mei , a famous male Dan in the male trou@@ pes of Yue opera .
his nickname is Junior Mei Lan@@ fang .
in 19@@ 17 , when Yue opera first entered Shanghai , it was the all @-@ male trou@@ pe .
but in the late 1930s .
we saw a trend that the all @-@ male trou@@ pe and the co @-@ performance of men and women began to disappear .
replaced by women @-@ dominated Yue opera .
in particular , we noticed that Dan role actors were more popular in the early stage .
but gradually the status of Xia@@ os@@ h@@ eng actors began to rise .
Yao Shu@@ i@@ ju@@ an , the Em@@ press of Yue opera , was the most popular actress in 19@@ 41 .
and Yin Gui@@ fang , the Emperor of Yue opera , was the most popular actress in 1948 .
in 1947 , ten Yue opera act@@ resses jointly performed Love of Mountains and Ri@@ vers .
which caused a sensation in the Shanghai Bun@@ d .
they were called the Ten S@@ ist@@ ers of Yue opera .
among them , there are three female Xia@@ os@@ h@@ eng and three female La@@ os@@ h@@ eng .
here I want to mention that last year , Fan Ru@@ i@@ ju@@ an , Xu Y@@ ul@@ an and Fu Qu@@ anx@@ iang , the last three sisters of the Ten S@@ ist@@ ers of Yue Opera , passed away one after another .
well , the Ten S@@ ist@@ ers of Yue opera can only sing in the heaven from now on .
however , their career in the human world is still continuing .
the formation of women @-@ dominated Yue opera was closely related to the fact that a large number of female audiences began to pour into the theatre at that time .
if we have the opportunity to go to the theatre today .
we will still find that there are obvious differences in gender composition between Peking opera audiences and Yue opera audiences .
as I said earlier .
if cross @-@ gender performance comes from the requirements of gender norms of the society .
then you may ask why audiences are still able to accept , or even prefer the performances by Qian Dan K@@ un Sheng when gender segregation has been abolished ?
why does Qian Dan K@@ un Sheng become an artistic aesthetic ?
I think the first reason is that people appreciate difficult acting skills .
generally speaking , a male playing the female role or a female playing a male role is more inconvenient and unnatural .
as a result , cross @-@ gender performance itself is a difficult and complex performance as physiological limitations need to be broken through .
those friends who have seen Chen Kai@@ ge &apos;s film F@@ are@@ well My Con@@ cub@@ ine may be impressed by such a plot in the movie that Dou@@ zi was sold by his mother to study opera in the trou@@ pe and played the little n@@ un in Dre@@ aming of the World Out@@ side the N@@ un@@ n@@ ery .
when he sang the lyrics &quot; I am by nature a girl , not a boy . &quot; he always sang the wrong line &quot; I am by nature a boy , not a girl . &quot;
it was not until his brother Sh@@ it@@ ou stabbed his mouth with a cigarette bag that he finally sang the line correctly with blood in his mouth .
here is a metaphor about identity loss , changing from gender mal@@ position to gender identity .
of course , the movie has its theme to express .
however , from the perspective of the researchers .
I think it may exaggerate the importance of gender identity and will make people mistake it as if only a feminine man can be a qualified male Dan .
I don &apos;t agree with this idea .
because the cross @-@ gender performance in traditional Chinese opera does not require performers to have psychological experience or gender identity .
the opera performers are not directly incar@@ n@@ ated as characters in the play , which is a fundamental feature of traditional Chinese opera performance .
between actors and characters , we have the role as an intermediary .
here I use the role as people often mix it with the character .
the role refers to the meaning of such an intermediary in the opera .
the character is actually equivalent to the person we refer to .
so the term we use should be the role .
the role is what we call the types of role , including Sheng , Dan , Jing , Mo , Ch@@ ou .
in terms of the relationship between the role and the character , it is a kind of classification of characters .
Sheng , Dan , Jing , Mo , Ch@@ ou represent different types of characters , including gender , identity , personality and so on .
in terms of the relationship between roles and actors , it is a division of labor for actors .
after learning the basic skills in old @-@ type opera school for one or two years .
the opera actor will be assigned a role according to his tim@@ bre and physi@@ que conditions , and then he can learn a whole set of performing skills of that role .
gender is not the key point for role allocation .
the key point is whether the actor can break through physiological limitations to master and use performance skills flexibly .
so the charm of cross @-@ gender performance may lie in the fact that when audience watch Mei Lan@@ fang &apos;s performance .
they will not forget that he is a man .
just like when we watch Mao We@@ it@@ ao or Wang P@@ ei@@ yu &apos;s performance today .
we will not forget that they are women .
in fact , what we see in the opera is how men play female roles and how women play male roles .
sometimes the stage image and the real image of the actor are very different .
the greater the difference is , the more the actor &apos;s ability will be shown .
here I want to take Mr. Cheng Yan@@ qi@@ u as an example . Cheng Yan@@ qi@@ u is one of the four greatest artists of Beijing Opera .
this is a still of Cheng Yan@@ qi@@ u &apos;s performance in The Pe@@ ony Pavilion when he was young .
isn &apos;t it very beautiful ?
actually , this is one of my favorite sti@@ l@@ ls .
it &apos;s really beautiful .
but Mr. Cheng had a heroic temperament .
he set himself free to enjoy everything when he was very young .
he ate meat in big chunk , drank wine in large bowls , and he was also a carbohydrate lover .
there were many legends about how much he ate in the opera community .
so when he was over 30 years old , he became very fat .
at that time , some people jo@@ kingly called him Mr. Big Fat of Wu@@ xi .
but when Mr. Cheng came to the stage , he was totally a different person as he walked around the stage and danced with sleeve @-@ shaking .
in fact , Mr. Cheng is very tall and strong .
if people see him in the back@@ stage , they will find that his costume is too short .
his costume is about two inches above his feet .
but when he comes to the stage , it just falls on his feet .
why ?
because he always walks on stage with his legs half squ@@ at@@ ted .
you can imagine how difficult it is .
if I were to squ@@ at here and talk to you for twenty minutes now , I couldn &apos;t bear it , but Mr. Cheng could .
according to the performance standard , when actors perform on the stage , no matter how fast they walk around , their shoes can &apos;t show outside the costume .
in opera performance today , most actors can &apos;t do that .
but Mr. Cheng can walk around the stage with his legs squ@@ at@@ ted .
he can not only hide his shoes , but also walk around in different patterns .
he can also make audience feel that his figure is full of grace and charm .
this doesn &apos;t rely on psychological experience or gender identity , but relies on more proficient , more flexible and natural performance skills to achieve the highest state of performance in opera .
viv@@ id@@ ness .
besides the acting skills of the actors , when we appreciate Qian Dan K@@ un Sheng , is there a deeper psychological motivation ?
I think there is .
we often think that the oppos@@ ites attract each other .
the male audience prefers to watch act@@ resses while the female audience prefers to watch actors .
but the male @-@ dominated Peking opera audience seems to appreciate male Dan more .
the female @-@ dominated Yue opera audience prefers female Xia@@ os@@ h@@ eng more .
this fact may provide us with another way of thinking .
because both sexes exist in actors at the same time , cross @-@ gender performance actually shows a process of understanding and recognizing the opposite sex .
Qian Dan and K@@ un Sheng may respectively shape the ideal image of the opposite sex in the minds of male and female audiences .
in this respect , the female Xia@@ os@@ h@@ eng of Yue opera may be a typical example .
and the Yue opera Liang Shan@@ bo and Zhu Ying@@ tai ( which is also known as The Butter@@ fly L@@ overs ) may be a most typical example .
the Butter@@ fly L@@ overs is a classic play of Yue opera .
it may be a little strange for audiences to see the performance of other operas after watching this Yue opera .
I have watched Peking opera and Sichuan opera In the Sha@@ de of the Wil@@ low , in which the role Liang Shan@@ bo is played by male actors .
although the actors are very skilled in the performance , I still feel a little uncomfortable .
why do I feel uncomfortable ?
I have thought over this problem seriously .
the most dramatic setting in The Butter@@ fly L@@ overs is the plot that Liang Shan@@ bo doesn &apos;t realize his classmate Zhu Ying@@ tai is actually a woman who disgu@@ ises as a man for three years .
this plot is only reasonable in one case .
that is , Liang Shan@@ bo is really innocent rather than pretend to be like that .
have you thought over ages of Liang Shan@@ bo and Zhu Ying@@ tai ?
for them , age is very important .
the audience today seem to think that the ages of Liang Shan@@ bo and Zhu Ying@@ tai are about the same as that of the college students coming home from summer vacation .
or at least same as that of high school students .
but if we infer from ancient marriage age and the plot details .
Liang Shan@@ bo and Zhu Ying@@ tai are teenagers at most .
they were about eleven or twelve years old when they met and fourteen or fifteen years old when they died for love .
the audience can only understand and accept Liang Shan@@ bo &apos;s ignorance in this way .
this situation creates a contradiction .
according to the plot , the two protagon@@ ists are naive teenagers .
but as for the performance difficulty , the plot can only be performed by adult actors .
when we watch the performance that an adult actor playing Liang Shan@@ bo lives and eats with a girl under the same roof but he still doesn &apos;t know the girl &apos;s real gender , we would not believe that .
it makes sense only for two possibilities .
firstly , if the actor looks like honest , then Liang Shan@@ bo played by him is really silly .
secondly , if the actor unfortunately looks like naus@@ eous , then Liang Shan@@ bo played by him is really bad .
whether he is silly or bad , we may feel sorry for Zhu Ying@@ tai .
there is another example , Zhang Sheng in The Story of the Western Chamber .
when he met Cu@@ i Ying@@ ying for the first time , he exclaimed , &quot; I met my girl to fall in love with her at first sight . &quot;
then he rushed to match@@ maker , the maid of Cu@@ i Ying@@ ying , introduced himself boldly .
&quot; I am Zhang Gong , with courtesy name of Jun@@ ru@@ i , a native of Lu@@ oyang . born from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. on the seventeenth day of the first month of lunar year , I am twenty years old and I have not married yet . &quot;
it is very interesting and beautiful to describe such a state of madness in words , but it is very difficult to play that on the stage because that is very aggressive .
a slight mis@@ step in acting may constitute sexual harassment , right ?
I &apos;m afraid that no matter how beautiful the actor is , the audience may feel uncomfortable at that .
but when Liang Shan@@ bo and Zhang Sheng are played by female Xia@@ os@@ h@@ eng , we find that the expressive force between the characters becomes different .
on the one hand , because actors are all women , they can be more intimate and natural in their performance style , without any restrictions .
on the other hand , because the audience clearly know that actors are women , this actually provides a similar effect of alienation .
the aggressive , offensive and threatening elements of sexual relations are blocked in the performance .
Liang Shan@@ bo is not a fool or an evil man , but is just gentle and generous .
Zhang Sheng is not a dirty man but is just warm and frank .
in their pursuit of love , sentiment far out@@ weighs sexual desire and the female performance can make the female audience feel safer .
what &apos;s more .
we can see that Liang Shan@@ bo and Zhu Ying@@ tai on the stage are two protagon@@ ists , one man and one woman .
but they are played by two female actors .
moreover , in the core plot S@@ aying Good @-@ B@@ ye .
we can see that Zhu Ying@@ tai also dresses up as a man .
so the actor who plays Zhu Ying@@ tai has to play Xia@@ os@@ h@@ eng role instead of customary role .
so in the opera performance it &apos;s very complicated for female actors to dress up as women or dress up as men .
it is a heteros@@ exual story .
but it also implies homosex@@ uality .
and the possibility of gender mobility and transformation .
so this is actually a gender game .
therefore , the appearance of female Xia@@ os@@ h@@ eng on the stage in Yue opera is to create some gentle and affectionate male images .
and to build a more reasonable sexual relation which is supported by mutual respect and equal understanding .
this obviously contains ideal expectation of female audience .
we often say that drama is the art of dreaming .
the stage world reflects our anxiety and desire in the real world .
from this point of view .
the cross @-@ gender performance of Chinese opera may be seen as an unconscious breakthrough and a small dream about gender pluralism , made by actors and audiences in society with a very single and rigid gender concept .
thank you !
today , I want to talk about tracing the roots of our Chinese nation through genes .
as we all know , China is a multi @-@ ethnic country , there are ethnic groups like Mi@@ ao , Han , Zhuang , Tibetan , Uy@@ gh@@ ur , and Kazak@@ h .
these ethnic groups are Chinese nations .
but are these ethnic groups the same ?
do they share the same ancestors ?
that is a difficult question , but we can try to find one through genes .
we &apos;re working on the history of the Chinese nation , to study the history , there are three aspects .
genes can help us determine the relationship between people or groups .
we can also draw on genes to determine the relationship between different ethnic groups .
fossils can be used to locate our ancestors , such as where they lived , where they moved to , and what the routes were .
we could tell all these with the fossils they left for us .
we can also study from the aspect of culture for it helps us to investigate the reasons of a particular event in ancient times .
for example , what caused people to move from one place to another ?
there may be psychological , social or even religious factors involved .
and when it comes to studying the roots of our nation , the most important way is genetics .
we can find some answers in genome about our ancestors and our roots .
but gen@@ omes are quite complex as they en@@ code different genetic components and patterns .
most of our genes are on the aut@@ os@@ omes .
ordinary chromosomes exist in pairs in our cells , one from the mother and one from the father .
this fits the inheritance laws .
the characteristics of the father and the mother are combined to create your body .
another genetic model is pater@@ nal inheritance , which is very special because the genetic material is exclusive to men and each man has only one .
it &apos;s called the Y chromosome .
so your Y chromosome is inherited from your father , and your father &apos;s Y chromosome comes from your grandfather .
and can even be traced back to the Y chromosome from your grandfather &apos;s grandfather &apos;s grandfather .
just like our sur@@ names , the Y chromosome is passed down from generation to generation .
it is the he@@ ir@@ loom of your family , right ?
so every man has such an he@@ ir@@ loom .
therefore , by investigating the differences in the Y chromosome sequence , we &apos;re able to calculate how many generations two people se@@ per@@ ated .
we just have to look at how far your Y chromosome sequence is from the other person to determine whether you were a family 50 years , or 500 years ago or even 5,000 years ago .
then we can draw everyone in a line@@ age tree of Y chromosome .
in this way , we can draw men all over the world on such a tree , which is rooted in Africa .
and about 70,000 years ago , a branch was separated from the African branch and formed all the people outside Africa .
if we place the line@@ age tree on the earth and position every branch of it on the earth , then we can get the map I just show you .
all modern people , all modern people that are alive on the earth , originated in Africa 200,000 years ago , from the Great Ri@@ ft Valley in East Africa .
about 70,000 years ago , some people moved from Africa to West Asia and gradually migrated to other parts of the world .
forming the current eight geographical races .
and the group of East Asians , to which the Chinese nation belongs , was formed about 30,000 years ago , a lot shorter than we think .
many people think we are descendants of Peking Man , with a history of 500,000 years , or even more , but in fact it is not the case at all .
we have found that our genes are not as different from each other or other groups as we think .
we are not descendants of Hom@@ o erec@@ tus , but like everyone else , we are descendants of Hom@@ o sap@@ i@@ ens .
after we arrived at the East Asians , groups of people among us gradually dispersed so different ethnic groups were formed .
in terms of the language , there are nine language families , or nine ethnic groups .
among them , the Chinese nation boasts four most important ethnic groups .
they are the Man@@ chu @-@ Mongolia ethnic group , or Al@@ t@@ aic languages .
the Sino @-@ Tibetan ethnic group , or Sino @-@ Tibetan languages .
the H@@ m@@ ong @-@ Mi@@ en ethnic group , or H@@ m@@ ong @-@ Mi@@ en languages .
the Dong @-@ Dai ethnic group .
these four ethnic groups make up most of China &apos;s 56 eth@@ nic@@ ities .
these ethic groups share similar Y chromosomes , so they have the same ancestors .
the differences in Y chromosomes of these ethnic groups show us that they set foot on Yunnan province about 20,000 years ago and gradually spread to other regions of China .
this forms the basis for different ethnic groups .
but when they arrive at a certain place or region , these groups will not form an ethnicity immediately .
an ethnicity is not formed until a new culture and the civilization come into being .
this is related to a special geological event -- the end of the ice age .
during the ice age , the whole world was covered with snow and ice .
except the tropical areas , most parts of the world , including China , are freezing .
the temperature of Nanjing may be lower than that of Beijing , and the average temperature was 8 degrees lower than the current temperature , or even lower .
under such circumstances , the plants on the earth were very sparse and few animals fe@@ eded on plants , so the source of human food was very limited .
this led to a small global population .
with a small population , it was impossible to give birth to a new culture or civilization , let alone an ethnicity .
12,000 years ago , the ice age came to an end and the world &apos;s animals and plants began to flourish .
this brought human much more food and human reproduction began to accelerate .
so 1@@ 1,000 years ago , the global population began to expand .
as there were more people , they began to invent all kinds of things .
so 10,000 years ago , agriculture appeared in West Asia and East Asia .
what followed was more food and thus a larger population .
it was a process of rapid , virtuous cycle and positive feedback .
a larger population gave birth to a larger group of intelligent people .
this way , their inventions continued to grow and become more refined .
and 9,000 years ago , we entered the new stone age .
in the new stone age , many people gathered in different agricultural areas and thus formed different cultural circles .
these cultural circles were the birthplace of each ethnic group .
after another 1,000 years , about 7,000 years ago , the four ancient civilizations took shape gradually .
this is a natural law .
in the sky , the weather changed .
on the ground , agriculture occu@@ red only after there was land .
civilizations or people occu@@ red only after there were agriculture .
this echoed with an old saying from the Tao T@@ e Ching , &quot; Human follows land , and land follows the heaven . &quot;
civilizations are born only after the occurrence of agriculture .
so how many sources are there of the Chinese civilization ?
that depends on the number of birth@@ places of agriculture .
in China , there are two major birth@@ places .
one is that dis@@ cri@@ bed in The Sun Sh@@ ines Over the S@@ ang@@ gan River , the S@@ ang@@ gan River , a mainstream birthplace of the Chinese civilization .
for a long time , mil@@ let remains one of the most important crops in northern China .
and of course yellow rice is just as important , but it has a much less output than mil@@ let .
but isn &apos;t wheat a major crop in the north ?
actually , wheat is not native to China . it wasn &apos;t until more than 4,000 years ago that wheat was transmitted to China from its birthplace in West Asia .
apart from mil@@ let , the other source of agriculture is rice in southern China .
rice first appeared in the Yuan River .
about 1@@ 1,000 years ago , people from the P@@ eng@@ tou@@ shan culture began to domestic@@ ate and cultivate rice .
well , the other birthplace of rice could be the province of Zhejiang .
but in Hunan , the domestic@@ ation and cultivation of rice is a very clear process .
when the crops spread to various parts of China , they gave rise to different cultural groups in different agricultural and farming areas .
in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River , a series of cultural circles were formed , including D@@ ax@@ i and Ga@@ om@@ i@@ ao cultures .
and in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River , a cultural line@@ age occu@@ red , with Hem@@ ud@@ u , Ma@@ ji@@ ab@@ ang , S@@ ong@@ ze and Ma@@ qiao as the mainstream cultures .
in the middle reaches of the Yellow River , the cultural line@@ age of the Yang@@ sha@@ o culture came into being .
the D@@ aw@@ en@@ kou and Long@@ shan cultures took shape in the lower reaches of the Yellow River .
another important place is the Li@@ ao@@ he River basin in northeastern China , where series of cultures from Xing@@ long@@ tu@@ n to Hong@@ shan to Xia@@ ji@@ ad@@ ian were formed .
therefore , in the new stone age , the five areas were the major origins of the Chinese civilization , and they thus formed the birth@@ places of different ethnic groups .
the ethnic groups had quite different cultures .
about 5,000 years ago , a major historical event brought ethnic group that cultivated mil@@ let and that cultivated rice together to form the Chinese nation .
the integration of the cultures of mil@@ let cultivation and rice growing finally led to the formation of the Chinese nation .
how did the integration happen ?
in fact , it was because of the war and cultural exchanges .
and these processes required the presence of a leader .
our ancestors were the leader of our ethnic group .
in fact , there were already leaders in ancient times , which could be found in human genome .
we should go back to the Y chromosome to explain the whole thing .
if we collect the Y chromosomes of all men in China and draw them into a line@@ age tree , we &apos;ll find a very strange phenomenon .
suppose in ancient times , if a man gave birth to a son , then his Y chromosome would be passed to the son .
but if he had two sons ， he would pass on two copies of his Y chromosome to his sons , and their genes became different .
their family should have sons in every generation to pass on the Y chromosome to the present generation so that it could be passed down and detected in modern times .
but this is a very difficult thing , especially for ordinary people .
it is difficult to give birth to a son for hundreds of generations and to pass on the Y chromosome to the present day .
so generally speaking , each line@@ age is passed down by a single line in the tree .
it is not easy to have two lines or one or two branches .
but surprisingly , there are three points in the simplified map , each with dozens of branches .
the population along these branches continues to expand and is even linked to nearly half of Chinese men .
what does this mean ?
it means there are three people who had numerous sons , grand@@ sons , grand grand@@ sons and many off@@ springs .
after so many generations , half of Chinese men are descendants of these three people .
this is true .
because the descendants must have ancestors , and but the ancestors may not have descendants .
we have calculated when the three people lived based on the differences in the Y chromosome sequence .
the first people lived 6@@ 800 years ago , the second one 6@@ 500 years ago , and the third one 5@@ 400 years ago .
we have coded them into three O@@ 3 groups : O@@ 3@@ α , O@@ 3@@ β and O@@ 3@@ γ .
but who are they ?
they must have a very high political status , right ?
otherwise they couldn &apos;t have had so many wives and sons .
and they must have a lot of money and food to feed their sons .
this way , their off@@ springs continued to expand for a long time to the extent where half of the country &apos;s population is their descendants .
so they must be leaders with a high political status .
can we find traces of them in archae@@ ology ?
they must have magnificent tombs , right ?
they must have left a trace or something .
so are there traces of them in archae@@ ology ?
yes , there are .
the first of the three people lived 6@@ 800 years ago , when the first cities were established in China .
it was an ancient city in Cheng@@ tou Mountain of Li@@ xian County of Chang@@ de , in northeastern Hunan .
the mo@@ at of the city was five meters wide , and its wall was five meters high .
of course , its construction was gradual .
there were palace @-@ like relics , handicraft workshops , al@@ t@@ ars , and imperial tombs .
of course , to archaeologists , the imperial tomb is nothing but a tomb of the city leader .
but the grave goods of the city leader were very interesting .
he was wearing two beautiful ag@@ ate rings around the chest , which were reserved for people with a high status .
so he must have been a man of a very high status .
this kind of thing was hard to find 6@@ 800 years ago .
but we also dug out a lot of ritual utensils from the tomb , including white ter@@ rac@@ ot@@ ta dishes with oc@@ tag@@ onal stars .
are oc@@ tag@@ onal star related to the Eight Diag@@ rams ?
this is where you can exercise your imagination .
the civilization or the site belongs to the Ga@@ om@@ i@@ ao culture .
the Ga@@ om@@ i@@ ao culture is very interesting .
it is closely related to the cultures of Mi@@ ao and Yao ethnic groups , or the H@@ m@@ ong @-@ Mi@@ en ethnic groups , languages .
in the Ga@@ om@@ i@@ ao culture , there are often symbols featuring pho@@ en@@ i@@ xes , with big eyes and bent be@@ aks .
they closely resemble the patterns in the Mi@@ ao embroidery .
the oc@@ tag@@ onal star on the pottery can also be seen in the Mi@@ ao costumes , and the two are almost the same , apart from an added s@@ q@@ a@@ ure and cross in the center in the latter .
what does this stand for ?
this requires more refined explanations from cul@@ tu@@ ro@@ logy .
so the direct heir of this culture is actually the Mi@@ ao ethnic group .
the second people lived 6@@ 500 years ago , when the Yang@@ sha@@ o culture began to take shape in central China .
in Pu@@ yang of Henan province , we found a huge tomb called X@@ ish@@ u@@ ip@@ o .
interestingly , the owner of the tomb was buried in a huge grave .
there were many shells that were arranged in the shape of animals .
at the foot of the tomb owner , the shells were arranged in the shape of the Big D@@ ipper star in the north , and a green dragon in the east .
there were a green dragon on the left and a white tiger on the right , I wonder which clan the owner belonged to .
and in the south , the shells were arranged in the shape of the seven representative animals of seven const@@ ell@@ ations in the East .
surrounded with stars , he seemed like the sun , the god of the sun .
we may have our own ideas of who this god of sun was .
well , the identity of the tomb owner is still open to question .
since we haven &apos;t conducted the genetic testing , we cannot draw a definitive conclusion .
so which ethnic groups are related to the Yang@@ sha@@ o culture ?
let &apos;s take a look at the typical artifacts in the Yang@@ sha@@ o culture .
there were often images of the sun , as to symbolize the god of the sun , painted on their pottery .
there was also Yin Yang Fish , resembling two fish holding the sun .
this is un@@ earthed from the Ban@@ po ruins and is a typical arti@@ fact of the Ban@@ po culture .
so far , the Yin Yang Fish is still preserved in the cultures of Tibetan and Q@@ iang peoples , for example , in the furniture of the Tibetan ethnic group .
un@@ earthed pottery of the Ma@@ ji@@ ay@@ ao culture in the late Yang@@ sha@@ o culture contains port@@ a@@ its of human beings , dancing hand in hand in a circle .
this is what we call pot dance , a kind of dance that is unique to the Q@@ iang , Tibetan and Yi ethnic groups .
this culture is actually related to the Yi and Tibetan ethnic groups .
so central China is probably the birthplace of these ethnic groups .
so where was the birthplace of the Han ethnic group ?
it &apos;s not central China , although some of the Han ethnic group does start off there , right ?
the origin of the Han culture is probably associated with the third people .
the third person lived 5@@ 400 years ago in the Hong@@ shan culture of Liaoning .
people begin to build huge stone tombs , square @-@ shaped tombs which may look like a pyramid .
if it were a pyramid , then Chinese pyramids would be 600 years older than the Egyptian ones .
in the first tomb of the center of the tombs , a very handsome man was un@@ earthed , with thick eyebrows and big eyes .
he was very rich , tall and rich .
his grave goods included six jade artifacts of high quality .
so we can draw the safe conclusion that he must have a high status .
in the surrounding tombs , there are 16 pyramid @-@ like tombs that belong to his offspring .
so this is probably a tomb of the roy@@ als .
you may feel very familiar with the Hong@@ shan culture , and the jade artifacts .
people at that time were crazy about j@@ ades .
this is also the tradition of the Han people , right ?
the jade represents the gentleman &apos;s temperament and it is reserved for the people with integrity and talents .
so the Han people like it most .
other ethnic groups are not as crazy about j@@ ades .
B@@ UR the Han people use j@@ ades the most .
the j@@ ades usually are in the shape of dragons and pho@@ en@@ i@@ xes , which are the marks of the Han people .
also the little figures in jade of Tao@@ ism , their hands are ac@@ ros@@ sed in front of the chest , with their abdomen rising and chest collapsing , as if they were inhal@@ ing through the D@@ anti@@ an .
this may be related to the Tao@@ ist tradition .
the culture in the northeastern China is likely to be the source of the Han culture .
so the three ethnic groups lay the earliest foundation for the formation of the Chinese nation .
then 5,@@ 300 years ago , there was a great fusion of cultures .
the culture from the northeastern China quickly spread to the south , and influenced and transformed the culture of the whole country .
this transformation may lead to the ming@@ ling of the genes of the three ethnic groups .
this could be the legendary Battle of Zhu@@ ol@@ u that brought the three ethnic groups together to form the Chinese nation .
the ethnic groups on the periphery of the influence gradually became the ethnic minorities .
for this reason , we know that the genes of the ethnic minorities are nearly the same as those of the Han ethnic group .
the Mi@@ ao ethnic group contains the same genes of O@@ 3@@ γ and O@@ 3@@ β as the Han people .
the genes in the Tibetan ethnic group are mostly β .
and the Han people have all of the three genes .
so the Chinese nation shares the same roots .
the characteristics of the Chinese nation could be summed up as follows .
it is identical in terms of genes , diverse in terms of the origins , and integrated in terms of culture .
so the Chin@@ es nation shares the same ancestors , with diverse and integrated cultures .
therefore , we &apos;re very proud of our nation , of our long history which could be traced back to nearly 7,000 years ago .
we hope our nation will be more united and come to a rapid rejuven@@ ation .
thank you .
hello , everyone .
my name is Xu Xiao@@ hong .
today we are going to discuss whether our brains have gender differences .
as the saying goes , men and women are different .
when look at these two works of art , we can tell that there are significant differences between men and women in terms of primary and secondary sexual characteristics .
and due to the existence of these differences , men and women , or male and female , are classified into different groups .
just like the toilet lo@@ gos that can be seen everywhere .
under this gender @-@ specific framework , you can only choose one or the other .
so , when filling in form regarding to gender , or choosing which toilet you are going to use .
the answer is un@@ questionable and very specific .
accordingly , in our daily life , we can notice that men and women behave differently .
for example , boys can be more aggressive and prefer to play with gun toys .
while normally girls tend to love stuffed toys and playing house , and are good at looking after others .
naturally we will ponder .
are these behavioral differences caused by the differences in our brain ?
is it true that in a man &apos;s brain there is an aggression center and a &quot; sex &quot; center ?
and there is a communication center and an emotion center in a woman &apos;s brain ?
to answer this question , we need to learn some basic knowledge about our brains .
this is our brain .
of course it isn &apos;t colorful at all , and the colors are designed to mark the different functional zones of our brain .
each brain is about 1.5 kil@@ o in weight , and there are about 100 billion neurons in it .
yes , over 100 billion neurons that equal to the@@ 11th power of 10 .
these neurons do not exist in isolation , but are interconnected to form a complex neural network , that processes information in a way similar to current transmission .
so it &apos;s no exaggeration to say that your brain is a small universe .
this is a lateral view of a MRI of our brain .
you can see those markings over there .
the uneven area on top of the picture is our cerebral cortex , which is responsible for many advanced functions , such as language and mathematics among others .
there &apos;s an area down below is called the corpus call@@ os@@ um , which is a nerve tract that connects your left brain and right brain , connecting the left and the right hem@@ is@@ p@@ heres like a high @-@ speed cable .
further down at the back of your head , at the position where you normally bury in the pillow .
it is called cere@@ bell@@ um , an area responsible for your coordinated movement .
and your brain@@ stem is further below , covering different functional zones .
there is a hypo@@ thal@@ am@@ us located at the bottom of our brain , which is an ancient and conservative structure .
hypo@@ thal@@ am@@ us controls some of our basic physiological home@@ ost@@ asis , including body temperature regulation and some basic instinc@@ tive behaviors , such as feeding .
please remember such a structure , as we will take a closer look at it later on .
hyp@@ ophy@@ sis is down there , which is a gland responsible for the hormone secretion .
imagine , I &apos;m going to dis@@ sect this brain and put it flat on the table , how would it look like ?
this is how it will look like .
you can imagine yourself lying flat with your face down , then that &apos;s how your brain will look like if we took it out .
your cere@@ bell@@ um connects with your brain@@ stem at the back , and the upper part belongs to your frontal lobe .
imagine , you cut the brain like cutting a rad@@ ish into pieces , and that is how it will look like .
on each longitudinal section , you see something like this .
the gray area is the neuron , the clustering area of nerve cells that I have mentioned earlier .
and the white area is neuro@@ fibro@@ min , which is the clustering area for those wire @-@ like structures that are sent by the neurons .
so now , we have had a basic understanding of our brains .
we then have this question in mind .
is there any obvious gender @-@ specific difference in our brain structure , as apparent as the primary and the secondary sexual characteristic that reveals the gender identity ?
we are all curious about this question .
however , scientists have tried in vain , and there isn &apos;t any such a gender @-@ specific structure in our brain .
in other words , our brain doesn &apos;t have anything similar to the Adam &apos;s apple or pointed breast that can reveal the gender identity , there isn &apos;t such a structure .
so , men and women are identical in terms of brain structure .
does it mean that there isn &apos;t any slightest difference between a man &apos;s brain and a woman &apos;s brain ?
not really .
to say it simply , as these two curves have shown , a man &apos;s brain is 10 % to 20 % larger or heavier than a woman &apos;s brain .
here , look at the curve of a man &apos;s brain , we can tell that the curve on the right is much wider , meaning that its mean value is larger than that of a woman &apos;s brain .
and the individual differences are even greater .
a man has a larger brain than a woman .
does it mean that a man is smarter than a woman ?
we can &apos;t make such a conclusion yet , as we all know that a man is physically stronger than a woman .
but we can select a new calibration , which is the result of the brain &apos;s weight being divided by a person &apos;s actual weight , and we will see a reversal trend .
at all stages of our development , there is no difference between men and women in this value .
when you take a look at the right side , when both men and women are physically mature , women have a much larger value that that of men .
so , who has a large brain , men or women ?
similarly , I have just told you that the male brain is larger than the female brain .
take a look at this MRI photo , the area in blue is referred to the cortex area .
you can tell that the average value of men is larger than that of women .
however , if we don &apos;t look at the size , but the thickness of the cortex area , you will see a reversal trend .
compared to other functional zones of our brain , a woman has a much thicker cortex area than that of a man .
there are many other similar researches , and become a source of debate for scientists .
is there any difference between a man &apos;s brain and a woman &apos;s brain ?
it is up to the parameters you have chosen and the angle in which you look at the problem .
is there such an area in our brain that is so distinct that we can identify the gender ?
yes , there is .
medi@@ al pre@@ optic nucleus area is exactly such an area .
back in the 1970s , researchers discovered that there was a particular area in a rat &apos;s brain that displayed a significant gender difference .
where is medi@@ al pre@@ optic nucleus area located ?
do you still remember the hypo@@ thal@@ am@@ us that I have mentioned earlier ?
it is located at the bottom of our brain , which is an ancient but conservative structure .
hypo@@ thal@@ am@@ us controls some of our basic physiological home@@ ost@@ asis , including body temperature regulation and some basic instinc@@ tive behaviors .
if I use volleyball to describe the size of your head , then the hypo@@ thal@@ am@@ us is a ping @-@ p@@ ang @-@ sized thing located at the bottom of the volleyball .
while medi@@ al pre@@ optic nucleus area is a soybean @-@ sized thing within the ping p@@ ang ball .
however , when researchers carried out cerebral tissue hist@@ ologic studies on this soybean @-@ sized structure .
they noticed that it contained a distinct feature that could identify the gender .
you can tell clearly that this area is particularly darker for a man &apos;s brain .
it is because the number and the density of neurons in a man &apos;s brain , is much higher than that in a woman &apos;s brain .
what is more amazing is that researchers discovered the evolution of this difference in male and female had a certain degree of conserv@@ atism .
in 1985 , researchers discovered that area and the gender @-@ specific structure in our human brains .
look at this picture .
I didn &apos;t make any markings , but you can tell which side is a man &apos;s brain and which is a woman &apos;s brain .
when making a comparison of these two nucleus masses , you can tell that a man &apos;s brain has a greater number of neurons , or a higher density of neurons .
then naturally we want to figure out the functions of this nucleus mass .
is it because of the existence of this nucleus mass that leads to the gender difference and the ensuing behavioral difference ?
as I told you earlier , this nucleus mass is so tiny , and in a MRI picture it is even smaller than a pixel .
and of course , for ethical reasons , researchers are only allowed to continue our studies on model animals , especially rats and mice .
we want to find out the exact function of this nucleus mass .
in the past 30 to 40 years since this nucleus mass was first discovered .
we have discovered that a male rat will display a disturbed court@@ ship behavior when this nucleus mass has been damaged beforehand .
this nucleus mass might be responsible for the sex impulse .
while a female rat will display a disturbed maternal behavior when this nucleus mass has been damaged beforehand .
the female rat doesn &apos;t know how to look after its pu@@ ps .
this finding seems to be identical with our traditional understanding of the characteristics of gender behavior - men are more impulsive and women are good at caring for others .
is it really so in reality ?
as a scientist , I want to gain a better understanding of this matter .
after 5 years &quot; hard work , me and my research team have made some academic achievements , which are good enough to challenge the traditional opinions .
our research achievement was published on Nature Communication this January .
we did an important experiment that had never been done before , which was to activate this particular brain area .
by applying a special technology , we were able to make nerve cells at the medi@@ al pre@@ optic nucleus to express a sort of light @-@ sensitive proteins .
at the same time we planted a fiber optic thread within a mouse &apos;s head .
each time I generated light , the neuron would start discharging .
in other words , I could use a single fiber optic thread to control the activities of this particular brain area remotely , or I could let this brain area to discharge anytime I want .
by doing so , we can carry out an interesting behavioral experiment .
over here you can see a male mouse , its head carrying a fiber optic thread , and its medi@@ al pre@@ optic nucleus now being light @-@ sensitive .
within the same cage , I have put a female mouse in heat .
in this video , you will notice a blue grid , in other words , at this period of time I have generated light .
the male mouse , un@@ controll@@ ably , ran to the female mouse and began a court@@ ship act .
it is a typical experiment .
we activate this brain region by giving light , and I can induce this sexual impulse and later sexual activities from a male mouse .
and naturally we want to know the reaction of a female mouse if we perform the same experiment .
if I activate the same brain area in a female mouse and within the cage there is a female mouse in heat .
what will happen next ?
we will soon find out .
this is a female mouse , and soon I will generate light .
the result is very clear now .
the female mouse will display cop@@ ulation despite that it doesn &apos;t have an external genital organ of male .
judging from the behaviors of these two mice , if I don &apos;t tell you their g@@ enders beforehand , it might be hard for you to identify their gender .
accordingly , this brain area is also associated with maternal behavior .
this is a male mouse .
normally it will turn a blind eye to those scattered pu@@ ps , if not biting or kicking them .
we first activate the medi@@ al pre@@ optic nucleus area of a male mouse .
the male mouse , as if a caring mother , will consciously start picking up the pu@@ ps , or bring these pu@@ ps together , or place these pu@@ ps in the nest , if we provide it with a nest .
there is no suspense at all .
in a female mouse we can also induce similar behaviors .
when we activate the medi@@ al pre@@ optic nucleus area of a normal female mouse , its maternal love will be naturally aroused .
by activating medi@@ al pre@@ optic nucleus , we succeed in resolving the seemingly ir@@ reconc@@ il@@ able sex @-@ associated behavioral differences .
the experiment is carried out on a condition that I have made some treatment of a mouse &apos;s head .
is that possible that because of the treatment the gender of the mouse has changed ?
or the mouse therefore has different gender cognition ?
we then carry out a rigid comparison experiment , and the result tells otherwise .
why ?
when I didn &apos;t give light anymore , they went back to the behavioral norms , which males are more sexually impulsive , and female mice have more care for pu@@ ps .
at the same time , we measured their hormone levels .
the and@@ rogen levels of a male mouse and a female mouse did not change at all , even I have made their medi@@ al pre@@ optic nucleus area express light @-@ sensitive proteins .
that is to say , we did not change their respective gender at all .
however , when we activate the medi@@ al apparent nucleus area once again , these mice will continue displaying trans @-@ gender behaviors .
so , in conclusion , despite of the noticeable difference of the medi@@ al apparent nucleus , medi@@ al apparent nucleus has the potentials to control the trans @-@ gender behaviors .
our other researches also discover that there were a group of nerve cells within the medi@@ al apparent nucleus that can reinforce the gender @-@ specific characteristics .
we hope that we can continue our studies on this regard in the future .
due to the conserv@@ atism of the evolution of such a brain region and we are not able to do the same experiment in a human brain , we can predict that .
if we were able to put a same fiber optic thread on your head and make the medi@@ al apparent nucleus light @-@ sensitive , maybe you will realize the existence of your un@@ tapped potentials .
what can we learn from this research finding ?
first of all , I want to talk about the relevance and caus@@ ality .
in fact , a lot of gender related prejudices and misunderstanding come from the confusion of relevance and caus@@ ality .
here we clearly see that a particular brain area has a higher density of nerve cells in a male &apos;s brain and this brain area in a way controls the court@@ ship behavior .
but it is incorrect to say that this brain area doesn &apos;t have any other ability .
and similarly this particular brain area affects a female &apos;s maternal behavior , but it is incorrect to say that this brain area won &apos;t affect a male &apos;s court@@ ship behavior .
it is true that there are structural differences between a man &apos;s brain and a woman &apos;s brain .
however these differences can never be treated as evidence for gender discrimination .
this kind of practice is totally anti @-@ scientific .
and our researches suggest that our brains are likely to be her@@ m@@ aph@@ ro@@ di@@ tic .
regardless of your gender or your behavioral pattern , your brain has the trans @-@ gender potential .
when you have realized and exploited this potential , you could become a better self .
that &apos;s all for my presentation today .
thank you !
hi , everyone .
look at this old man on the screen .
do you know what his occupation is ?
well , if you ask me , my answer is that he is a detective .
those of you who major in biology may find this answer ridiculous .
well , I call him the most famous private detective in the world because he discovered that &quot; God created man &quot; was a huge lie .
we all know his name is Charles Darwin .
he is a famous British natur@@ alist and the founder of Dar@@ win@@ ism .
he had numerous well known publications , of which , On the Orig@@ ins of Species is the most widely known one and has exerted far @-@ reaching influence .
on the Orig@@ ins of Species was published in 18@@ 59 and is nearly one hundred and sixty years old .
up to present , both the public and scientists still have various misunderstandings about the book , the author and his theory of evolution .
when I was in graduate school .
one student who was studying evolution went to the professor and asked for advice on his essay .
the professor asked him , &quot; I saw a citation of On the Origin of Species in your first chapter , have you read it ? &quot;
he replied , &quot; Yes , I have . &quot;
the professor went on and asked , &quot; In that case , can you tell me what is the first chapter ? &quot;
I believe many of you have read On the Origin of Species .
but lots of people don &apos;t know what the first chapter is .
the first chapter of On the Origin of Species is &quot; Vari@@ ation under Dom@@ es@@ tic@@ ation . &quot;
some people do know that the first chapter of the book is &quot; Vari@@ ation under Dom@@ es@@ tic@@ ation . &quot;
but most of them do not understand why Darwin chose to begin the book with this chapter .
in fact , there is an important scientific question involved .
as we know that Darwin had a precious chance of going on a voyage on the Be@@ ag@@ le .
at the beginning of the voyage , he was a student fresh out of a sem@@ inary .
he would quote &quot; God &quot; every time he spoke and was thus mo@@ cked by the sailors a lot .
however , during the five years of sailing on the Be@@ ag@@ le .
he collected numerous specimens of animals and plants and did extensive geological surveys .
he traveled to many places .
he saw turtles , ig@@ u@@ anas , and ground fin@@ ch in the Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os Islands near South America and many fossils in other places .
these experiences challenged his view that &quot; all living species were created separately by God &quot; and led him to see the absur@@ dity in it .
Darwin thought if he wanted to propose another explanation about the origins of species .
he first had to explain how the species evolved .
at that time , almost everyone believed that there were fixed kinds of species , as many kinds as God had created .
Darwin had seen abundant living evidences himself , but it would be extremely difficult to persuade the others .
so , he thought the best way is to start with the domestic animals familiar to the average people .
at Darwin &apos;s time , pigeons were widely loved and training pigeons was very popular .
among all the varieties of pigeons , British hom@@ ing pigeon and p@@ outer are observ@@ ably different .
we can see that the hom@@ ing pigeons have twisted mouths .
the p@@ ou@@ ters have dis@@ propor@@ tionally large ch@@ ests , a kind of mal@@ formation .
you might think they are two species if not told .
however , they were all domestic@@ ated from wild rock pigeons .
wild rock pigeons can also be domestic@@ ated into other varieties .
nowadays , people do not find pigeons interesting any more .
but Darwin prepared us with other more relevant examples , such as dogs , horses , cattle , etc .
Darwin suggested that the blood of wild species of Can@@ id@@ ae , sometimes mingled together , flows in the veins of our domestic dog breeds .
what did he mean ?
put simply , he was saying , &quot; Dog@@ s are mixed @-@ breed . &quot;
the existing science has proven that dogs are descendants of wolves and they don &apos;t have a separate branch .
in the evolutionary history of dogs , hybri@@ di@@ zation does occur frequently .
therefore , using the variation in domestic breeds as example .
Darwin was able to persuade the others that species were evolving .
Darwin did his research in a progressive approach , from variation under domestic@@ ation to variation in nature , from explicit to implicit and from easy to hard .
this is in line with how we acquire new knowledge .
this is why Darwin chose to start the book with this chapter . it was very wise of him to do so .
on the Origin of Species involves information in different aspects .
naturally , it was widely questioned and misunderstood in various ways .
we will address some of the most common misunderstandings through three questions .
the first question , as the argument &quot; evolution by natural selection and survival of the fit@@ test &quot; goes .
should we just obey the law of the jungle and value the idea that only the strongest could survive ?
second one , did humans descend from apes ?
if not , then what is their relationship ?
the last question is that , published nearly 160 years ago , has On the Origin of Species become obsolete ?
to answer such questions .
we must have a basic understanding about the theory of evolution .
especially those in On the Origin of Species .
this understanding comes down to three aspects .
the first aspects is about the core of Darwin &apos;s principles of natural selection .
the second aspect studies the influence exerted on biology and science at large .
the third is to observe the developments the later biologists and scientists have made based on his theories .
the book can be divided into three parts .
the establishment of the principles of natural selection , the difficulties of the theory of evolution and the possible solutions , and the theoretical under@@ pin@@ nings of it .
the key component is the development of natural selection .
variation under domestic@@ ation or that in nature all suggest that variation is universal .
however , variation alone cannot account for the origins of species .
therefore , the variation must have a certain amount .
in the chapter of &quot; S@@ tru@@ ggle for Ex@@ ist@@ ence . &quot;
Darwin said that all species has the potential for exponential growth or over@@ breeding .
however , why didn &apos;t all species survive ?
it is because of the struggle for survival .
only species or variations that is fit to survival can be kept .
those unfit for survival are phased out .
this is called natural selection or survival of the fit@@ test .
in this part , Darwin obviously borrowed the population theory of Mal@@ thus .
on the chart with a dark background , we can see a red curve .
this red curve represents the potential of infinite exponential growth trend of each species .
however , reality is cruel .
due to environmental changes , food shortages , pre@@ d@@ ation by natural enemies , etc . , virtually no species can grow indefinitely or expon@@ entially .
the actual growth pattern is a s @-@ shaped curve like the blue one .
in addition , it has a definite peak , a limit .
the example given by Darwin is about elephant .
suppose an elephant can live for 100 years , and each couple have 6 babies .
then how many off@@ springs will the entire group of elephants produce after 750 years ?
19 million heads .
it is unrealistic .
due to the struggle for existence and natural selection , how many elephants there are now ?
very few .
we may think this is because of natural selection and survival of the fit@@ test .
in fact , the translation of &quot; natural selection &quot; and &quot; survival of the fit@@ test &quot; did not come from Darwin &apos;s On the Origin of Species , but from Yan Fu &apos;s Ev@@ olution of Heaven .
the Ev@@ olution of Heaven was not translated from Darwin &apos;s On the Origin of Species but Hu@@ x@@ ley &apos;s Ev@@ olution and Ethics .
when Yan Fu was translating this work , he added his own understanding .
is there any beneficial impact ?
yes .
the most beneficial impact is that it accelerated the cause of revolution in China .
we now talk about &quot; survival of the fit@@ test , &quot; but in the first version of the book , the term used by Darwin was &quot; natural selection . &quot;
survival of the fit@@ test does not equal to survival of the strongest .
when we talk about the survival of the fit@@ test , we are speaking in a relative sense .
let us see another example .
tigers rank higher than rabbits on the food chain , tigers feed on rabbits , so in this sense we can say that the tiger is the stronger of the two .
but in terms of fertility , rabbits have a comparative advantage .
they breed very fast while the tiger lit@@ ters consist of only two or three cu@@ bs .
we know tigers rather than rabbits are endangered .
so which are stronger , tigers or rabbits ?
there is no absolute answer in this sense .
during the publishing of On the Origin of Species , Darwin needed to rest a lot due to his poor health .
therefore , many of his followers promoted the book for him in different places .
but some supporters had their own interpretation towards the theory .
among whom there were Spencer , an advoc@@ ator of social Dar@@ win@@ ism and the creator of the expression &quot; survival of the fit@@ test , &quot; and Gal@@ ton , the founder of eu@@ gen@@ ics .
Gal@@ ton was Darwin &apos; cousin .
he was brilliant and was the founder of eu@@ gen@@ ics .
these two people applied Darwin &apos;s principles of natural selection to human society in a direct and simpl@@ istic way .
they believed in the survival of the more competitive in human society and those that were weak should be phased out .
that is to say , we should not protect and sympath@@ ize the weak .
however , Darwin did not think so .
in The Des@@ cent of Man and Selection In Rel@@ ation To Sex .
Darwin categor@@ ically opposed to a simpl@@ istic application of this theory to human society .
he believes that we should sympath@@ ize with the weak and help them , as this is the demonstration of the strength , a symbol of the progress of human society and civilization .
is it true that people evolved from monkeys ?
it is an interesting question .
ten days ago , there was a news in India about Sat@@ y@@ ap@@ ar Singh , a Minister responsible for higher education in the Ministry of Human res@@ sources Development of India .
Minister Singh made a remark , saying that Darwin &apos;s theory of evolution was wrong .
why ?
he said that the theory of evolution should be removed from the school curriculum because no one , whether living in the countryside or cities , had ever seen an ape turning into a man .
more than 2,000 scientists in India unanimously rejected the proposal , calling it a backwards step in human society .
so how should we look at the relationship between humans and apes ?
we now know that variation is universal .
with the existence of variations , we can representation the relationship between species in a way similar to a family tree .
a phy@@ lo@@ genetic tree can represent the relationship between species .
it is commonly agreed that we are more closely related to our brothers than we are to our cousins .
why ?
because you and your brother have a more recent common ancestor , your father .
you and your cousin have a less recent common ancestor , your grandfather .
humans and apes are far less related than you and your cousin are .
on average , the tim@@ esc@@ ale between our grandfather and us is less than one hundred years .
how far back does the last common ancestor that humans had with apes trace back to ?
about 25 to 30 million years .
the common ancestor of human and apes is at A , while the common ancestor of human and chimpanze@@ e is at C .
how far back in time is C ?
about five to seven million years .
in The Des@@ cent of Man and Selection In Rel@@ ation To Sex .
Darwin said the common ancestor of human and great apes , Dr@@ y@@ op@@ ith@@ ec@@ us , lived about seven million years ago .
to make an analogy , to say that humans evolved from monkeys is as ridiculous as to say that we descent from our cousins .
that is to say , no existing species desc@@ ents from another existing species .
although we cannot say that turtles descent from frogs .
we can say that they have a common ancestor and descent from the common ancestor .
then , has Darwin &apos;s theory of evolution gone out of date ?
we often see news in various news media and on websites claiming that Darwin &apos;s theory of evolution has been over@@ thrown
or Darwin sub@@ verted his own theory .
the theory was said to be either over@@ thrown or sub@@ verted .
how can we make our own judgement ?
it can be done in a simple way .
we should first ask a few questions .
is variation universal ?
does the struggle for survival still exist ?
does struggle for survival lead to survival of the fit@@ test ?
if the answer to these three aspects is still &quot; yes , &quot; then Darwin &apos;s theory of evolution is not yet outdated .
another concept related to Darwin &apos;s theory of evolution is &quot; evolution . &quot;
as we all know , this term did not occur in On the Origin of Species , but this book led everyone to accept the idea of ​ ​ evolution .
therefore , as long as journals are still publishing articles about evolution , then the theory of evolution is not yet over@@ thrown .
does this mean that Darwin &apos;s theory of evolution is flaw@@ less ?
no , it is not .
Darwin was very &quot; frank &quot; about the theory &apos;s shortcomings .
in the chapter of Laws of Vari@@ ation , he wrote , &quot; I do not know anything about the laws of variation . &quot;
how straightforward !
the theory &apos;s shortcomings were later compensated by Men@@ del &apos;s discovery of laws of inheritance .
after the publication of On the Origin of Species , the idea of evolution was widely accepted .
but few showed interests in the idea of selection .
many people thought the principles of natural selection were problematic .
they accepted the idea of evolution but rejected the principles of natural selection .
the principles of natural selection did not gain recognition until a new theory of evolution , modern synthesis was developed fifty years after Darwin &apos;s death , un@@ iting M@@ end@@ eli@@ an genetics and Dar@@ win@@ ian evolution .
we all know that Darwin &apos;s work did not involve the molecules , unlike the gen@@ om@@ ics today .
the molecular part was then made up for by neutral theory of molecular evolution by Kim@@ ura mot@@ oo and other researchers in this field .
modern genetic analysis has actually taken new Dar@@ win@@ ism to a new level .
new evidences keep emerging .
traditional branches of biology such as morphology , tax@@ onomy , pale@@ ontology , developmental biology and bi@@ og@@ e@@ ography , propelled by new findings in molecular biology , gen@@ om@@ ics , and bio@@ inform@@ atics , are advancing our understanding of evolution .
one of my former students went to the Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os Islands this year .
he saw elephant torto@@ ises , ig@@ u@@ anas and Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os pengu@@ ins , the species found north near the equator .
what he saw most was dar@@ win &apos;s fin@@ ches , a pl@@ eth@@ ora of evolutionary studies .
Darwin &apos;s original speculation on fin@@ ches has been proved by gen@@ om@@ ic findings .
these fin@@ ches evolve rapidly , a process referred as adaptive radiation .
these fin@@ ches have specialized beak shapes depending on their primary source of nutrition and occupy various ecological nic@@ hes .
scientists have also discovered that there is a species of ge@@ os@@ piz@@ a that is mixed @-@ breed .
this finding was published on Nature .
there was another legendary story about an amazing land in Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os Islands .
professor Grants and his wife , a divine couple of scientists from Princeton , observed fin@@ ches here for 40 years .
their latest research showed if one species of fin@@ ches mated with another species resident on the island , this could give rise to a new species within three generations .
this new species are distinctive in their song , beak size and shape .
it has formed a very independent and complicated bird line@@ age .
if Darwin were still alive , he would probably be amazed too .
he would also be amazed by the speed of formation of this new species , it could be realized within just three generations .
today we talked about the misunderstandings towards Darwin and his theory of evolution .
through the reflection on these misunderstandings .
we are able to understand that Darwin &apos;s contribution does not lie in what he has over@@ thrown .
although technically he has challenged cre@@ ation@@ ism , lots of people still believe in God .
Darwin &apos;s greatest contribution was to have changed how we perceive the natural world and ourselves .
the beauty of Darwin &apos;s theory is that he has had to the evidence in place even before it gets questioned .
Darwin was so frank and confident about this theory .
his principles of natural selection were tested and selected by history .
thank you .
good afternoon , everyone .
my name is Chen Jing and I am from Nanjing University .
my topic today is about Cy@@ bor@@ g .
have any of you heard of this concept ?
can you raise your hand if you have .
well , it &apos;s unlikely that you haven &apos;t heard the term before .
ah , particularly , it &apos;s interesting that I suddenly found this concept has entered the fashion world .
on GU@@ CC@@ I &apos;s F@@ all / Winter 20@@ 18 fashion show .
the designer Al@@ ess@@ and@@ ro publicly declared that he cur@@ ated the theme show by drawing inspiration from Don@@ na Har@@ away &apos;s concept .
as you can see .
it &apos;s a very different show .
why ?
because it looks a little scary .
we can see the model over here holding a simulated liz@@ ard .
then the two models , the second one on the left and the first one on the right , what are they holding in their hands ?
they are carrying repl@@ ic@@ as of their head in their arms just like carrying bags .
the one in the middle has a third eye on her face .
so what the four models are showing us is definitely not the traditional fashion that we know of .
let &apos;s take a look at a video clip .
the show was staged as a hospital room .
if you sit in the room , watching people dressing like this walking in front of you .
will you think they are beautiful ?
and will you still think that this is an expression of fashion ?
so this is a very interesting phenomenon .
it does show that the concept of Cy@@ bor@@ g , or the culture of Cy@@ bor@@ g , has been incorporated into our daily life and has significantly affected our expression about ourselves and about life .
well , we may be inclined to ask what exactly is Cy@@ bor@@ g ?
eh , I &apos;m sorry that I have to throw out a very complicated concept .
because Cy@@ bor@@ g actually had nothing to do with fashion when it was initially put forward by two aerospace engineers who knew nothing about fashion .
in 1960 , people were gripped by space fever .
so people at that time were wondering what they should do if humans are going to im@@ migrate to outer space one day .
their natural reaction would be .
&quot; well , let &apos;s build a space station and transform outer space , like Mars and the moon , into somewhere like the earth where we live . &quot;
but in fact , they found it hard to turn this into reality as there were various limitations .
so they thought out of the box .
&quot; we can &apos;t transform the environment , but we can transform ourselves . &quot;
starting from the home@@ o@@ static functioning , as they proposed .
if we imagine our body as a machine featuring a self @-@ regulating system that is unaffected by consciousness .
then our body can interact with some external machines , devices , equipment , etc . , in a complex but home@@ o@@ static way .
therefore , people invented the word &quot; Cy@@ bor@@ g . &quot;
human body , as a self @-@ regulating system .
is itself an organic information system .
so our interaction with other devices and machines is a transmission and feedback based on information .
as such , they created the concept of Cyber@@ netic organism .
which was abbrevi@@ ated to &quot; Cy@@ bor@@ g . &quot;
OK , it &apos;s still a little bit complicated .
let &apos;s simplify the concept to a single word , a very simple world that talks about man @-@ machine system , about the relationship between man and machine .
in reality , is there such a situation .
or is it just something purely scientific ?
if we broaden our vision a little bit .
we &apos;ll find a lot of cy@@ bor@@ g stuff in reality .
here is an example .
he &apos;s a soldier , but when he &apos;s equipped with an infrared camera , a head@@ set , and weapons such as sub@@ machine gun with a high beam .
or in a uniform with high @-@ tech clothing that helps him with body temperature and ambient sensitivity .
he &apos;s a Cy@@ bor@@ g to some extent .
so , Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( D@@ AR@@ PA ) invested RMB 400 million in its Ne@@ ural Engineering System Design ( N@@ ESD ) program in 20@@ 17 .
the greatest purpose of the program is to create super soldiers by taking the properties of human body in the natural state to a new height .
the same thing is true for some people who we think are extreme .
for example , the right picture on the screen is Steve Man@@ n .
a professor at the University of Toronto .
he &apos;s a very interesting guy .
when he was a graduate student at MIT 30 years ago .
he got this idea of seeing the world through a screen .
so he made his own wear@@ able device .
a wear@@ able device 30 years ago , it looks very clumsy .
but interesting .
since then , he had been wearing this device for 30 years to see the world .
but this device was getting smaller , smarter and lighter .
he was also experiencing an experiment , i.@@ e ..
what his life would be like if he &apos;s completely integrated with the machine and he can communicate with the machine .
so we can simply call such people machine @-@ augmented .
because they improve their body functions by some ex@@ os@@ k@@ elet@@ on equipment or auxiliary devices .
but simply speaking , what we often see in our life are restor@@ ative cy@@ bor@@ gs .
for example , people with physical disabilities or with physical illness , such as heart diseases .
would use artificial limbs or implant a cardiac pac@@ emaker to help them get back to their normal life .
this is the Bl@@ ade , a very famous example .
at this point , we can find that some of these auxiliary devices are actually helping us restore our body defects .
making our body as good as normal people &apos;s .
another case is sometimes people could get a bit greedy and would think they are not beautiful enough or they are too fat .
so what can they do ?
some sur@@ ger@@ ies can help them .
but their needs are not the so @-@ called normal needs .
they may want to be a little taller or become more perfect .
so we call them the restor@@ ative cy@@ bor@@ gs .
there is another case .
let &apos;s think about that - how many of us can live a day without a mobile phone , from the moment we open our eyes in the morning till the night .
my husband is sitting over there .
he often jokes at me like that &quot; I think the mobile phone is your real husband and I &apos;m just your concub@@ ine . &quot;
because you only pat me when you think of me .
but you can hold the phone in hand all day long . &quot;
so , think about it .
I &apos;ve had my students do this in class .
taking a note when you pick up your phone in the morning .
and calculating how long will you spend with your phone during a day .
some students are very honest .
he would say &quot; I started class at 9 : 10 and took my phone out at 9 : 30 .
but I put it back at once when I found I didn &apos;t receive any new messages . &quot;
some students may say that &quot; I started class at 9 : 10 and only used my phone at 10 : 10 during the break . &quot;
but on balance .
each of us , including myself .
may be interacting with machines , intelligent or not , for longer than we think .
in this case , we call us developed cy@@ bor@@ gs .
why ?
because digital technology has perv@@ aded our daily lives and entered our private life .
our subjects have even been projected into such digital equipment and become virtu@@ alized .
do you dare to say that your emotions are under your own control ?
do you dare to say that you are an independent person who doesn &apos;t need any mobile phones or any smart devices ?
it &apos;s hard to answer .
therefore , developed cy@@ bor@@ gs actually include you and everyone here .
even so , we can find in these processes that we humans are still important .
we still say that I &apos;m a human being although I fix my body , I have plastic sur@@ ger@@ ies .
or I can &apos;t live without my mobile phone .
then what about science @-@ fiction TV shows or movies ?
actually , they go further .
we can find such people in many science @-@ fiction novels , just like restor@@ ative cy@@ bor@@ gs we just talked about .
what they mainly do is to repair their body functions with external equipment when they suffer from physical damages .
but they are not intended to be natural people .
but to be stronger , faster , and higher .
so we can find this image in the American movie The Six Mil@@ lion Dol@@ lar Man .
then in Rob@@ o@@ C@@ op , there is a character who wears mechanical armor all over his body .
and you could only tell from his face that he is a human being .
there is another type of cy@@ bor@@ gs who go even further .
they don &apos;t have to think about how to combine their physical body with mechanical devices , and even if 20 % of their body consists of flesh and 80 % of mechanical devices .
if it happens to you , you may wonder how the two parts fit together .
other cy@@ bor@@ gs may not think so much .
as they only need to upload their consciousness into the fully re@@ shaped mechan@@ ized body .
this is a represented scene in the movie Rob@@ ot@@ ech .
in which there was a clan called C@@ ylon .
they are implanted with a collective thinking through uplo@@ ading or congenital inheritance .
only their queen is an independent subject .
in such a case , the insertion of consciousness and the combination of physical body and machine create a cy@@ bor@@ g .
without having to think about how to combine .
a case we are most familiar with is the role of Ne@@ o in The Mat@@ rix .
everything that happened to him , before the moment he woke up , before that , all of us , even himself .
didn &apos;t know that he was a real person , of flesh and blood .
it was only when he woke up in the matrix and saw a number of tiny ca@@ vities like honey@@ comb@@ s and wet bodies so@@ dden in nutrient solution that he realized he was a human being .
but unfortunately , he was told in the Seas@@ on 3 that no matter how real the body is , it may be a desert .
maybe he &apos;ll never get out of such a matrix dilemma .
in this case , it may signal a future .
if we really enter such a virtual reality world one day , in which our body fails to perceive our consciousness and the way of identification .
then where is our body ?
alright , if we go back to what we &apos;ve just discussed .
we can find that cy@@ bor@@ gs in both the real world and in the popular culture have always been in the struggle between man and machine .
in reality , there are boundaries among cy@@ bor@@ gs .
no matter whether I master a tool or how I transform my body .
my subject is still a human being and I do have boundaries with cy@@ bor@@ gs .
but in science @-@ fiction novels .
the representation is based more on imaginary symbols .
making such boundaries unclear and blurred .
we often see such a plot , the protagon@@ ist gets confused in the end about whether he &apos;s a man or a machine .
this kind of questioning often appears in the climax of the plot .
so that determines who the protagon@@ ist is going to speak for in this play .
but the interesting thing is that the protagon@@ ist never asked the gender . have you ever thought about the reasons ?
if you have , you &apos;ll find that in a lot of science @-@ fiction novels and movies .
gender is a topic that is put aside or a topic that doesn &apos;t need to be discussed .
whose logic do we think matters more ?
human &apos;s !
Oh my God .
the world is coming to an end and machines are going to destroy us .
and you &apos;re still wondering if you &apos;re a man or a woman .
thus it stands to reason that human becomes a logic above gender .
but in this case .
who decides the free subjectivity and essential provisions of human ?
unfortunately , it &apos;s men .
well , if that &apos;s true , we may ask , is it possible that cy@@ bor@@ gs have gender ?
of course they do , even C@@ ylon , that we &apos;ve just talked about , has female physical characteristics .
ghost in the Shell was one of the biggest box office bombs last year .
it was very interesting because since its debut , Cy@@ bor@@ g , a hot word in the 1960s , has become a bu@@ zz@@ word again .
many people are discussing Cy@@ bor@@ g again because of this movie .
I thought there might be a breakthrough in this movie and went to the cinema .
unfortunately , however , gender remains shel@@ ved .
why ?
you can recall it if you &apos;ve watched this movie , or just look at the poster if you haven &apos;t .
the protagon@@ ist shows obvious female characteristics , bu@@ sty and long @-@ legged , wearing almost bare armor .
but she doesn &apos;t show any sexual needs , nor any sexual traits .
in this movie , there even are a number of scenes that showed her bare mechanical body .
it is undoub@@ ted that she exists as a female cy@@ bor@@ g featuring female sexuality .
but her gender , which was not discussed , was taken to be an innate feature .
and she &apos;s as strong as a man in all her functions .
so she doesn &apos;t have to struggle , nor to think .
but meanwhile , her human side is best reflected by her search for her mother .
in which she identifies herself as a woman and a daughter .
through such a social identity .
she finds her humanity again .
therefore , we can see that in science @-@ fiction novels and in popular narrative .
we want to try to push the boundaries between humans and cy@@ bor@@ gs and also want to find a possibility to create a new gender logic .
but it &apos;s not easy .
the reason lies in our stipulations on the essential nature of human beings .
and in our imagination of the core of humanism for human beings .
and this kind of imagination or this kind of essence is exactly determined by male centr@@ alism .
OK , with all that said , it feels like there &apos;s no hope for the future , right ?
even if when you are not a human anymore .
so where is the possibility of revolution ?
here I have to say that in every discussion of revolution .
theory usually comes first .
so at this point , Don@@ na Har@@ away shared an idea .
a cy@@ bor@@ g is a cyber@@ netic organism , a hybrid of machine and organism .
a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction .
OK , but she also said that the cy@@ bor@@ g is our ontology .
it gives us our politics .
why ?
because she believes that , with modern communication technology and modern biology .
we have actually formed a common language based on information .
it &apos;s what we now call the information @-@ based , technology @-@ based language , including programming , algorithms and so on .
then there may be an opportunity for us to re@@ shape our subjects and make us rethink .
here , we , I mean the boundaries between humans and animals , between men and machine .
in such a process .
these boundaries may be broken and become flowing .
so what we are no longer predetermined .
and another question , is it possible that the future of everybody being cy@@ bor@@ g is really going to disappear ?
according to Don@@ na Har@@ away &apos;s assumption .
when can the boundaries be broken ?
but another philosopher , Andy Clark , argued that there is no need to break the boundaries .
because we have already done it .
as the moment we start wearing glasses , start writing with a pen , and start talking on a mobile phone .
we are interacting with machines .
in such interactions , our bodies are constantly being transformed and our subjects being re@@ shaped .
therefore , a cy@@ bor@@ g world like that might be an existing social reality and a physical reality .
but if one day we are no longer afraid of the kin@@ ship of the combination of animals and machines .
which means we create a mixture .
and we are no longer afraid of the changes of our identity .
for example , I could identify myself as a man , a woman , and even a robot .
then , to some point , we will have a paradox@@ ical confusion .
but it doesn &apos;t matter .
only in such a reality that is happening , or about to happen , continues to happen , gender does not disappear .
because it builds us .
but at the same time .
we also have many new possibilities which arise from these problems .
you can think about it or ask yourself .
are you afraid of your identity uncertainty ?
are you afraid of the changes brought about by technology ?
are you afraid that you are no longer &quot; yourself &quot; ?
and are you afraid of sexual flu@@ idity ?
that &apos;s all , thank you !
thank you .
you might have noticed that my research interest is theoretical computing , and naturally you might raise this question .
what exactly is theoretical computing ?
whenever I introduce myself to others , saying that my major is computing , they will ask me this question .
&quot; are you working in the fields of hardware or software ? &quot;
I feel very awkward and don &apos;t know how to answer this question .
as I am not in the fields of hardware nor software .
upon my graduation from university .
I have never written any computer program in the past decade .
when we work .
we only need a pen and a piece of paper .
when talking about the theoretical computing , the key word is not computer , but computing .
it is the science of computing .
what exactly are computing theories ?
what is the inter@@ relation among computing theories , computer and computer application ?
to me , the inter@@ relation is similar to the one between physics and applied engineering .
the principles of physics were first invented .
and then based on these principles engineering applications were created accordingly .
for example , in 18@@ 31 Michael Far@@ ad@@ ay discovered the electromagnetic induction principle .
it was only till 18@@ 67 the first generator was created by Si@@ emens .
the computing theory existed long before the first computer being invented .
this is the founding father of computing science , whose name is Alan M@@ ath@@ ison T@@ uring .
some of you might have seen a movie called The I@@ mit@@ ation Game that was put on show two years ago .
it was a movie portr@@ aying the life of Alan M@@ ath@@ ison T@@ uring .
the highest award in the computing science is called the T@@ uring Prize , which is also known as the Nobel Prize in the computing science .
so he is recognized as the founding father of computing science .
Alan M@@ ath@@ ison T@@ uring wrote an essay in 19@@ 36 .
introducing T@@ uring machine for the first time , and this essay also clearly defined computing .
what is the significance of having an accurate definition ?
it is significant from two perspectives .
firstly as a mathemati@@ cian himself .
Alan T@@ uring could use this knowledge to prove that something was impossible to calculate .
and secondly this T@@ uring machine was actually the prototype of today &apos;s computer .
a modern computer was first invented based on a mathematical model like this .
just like physics focusing on the truth about the universe .
the computing theory focuses on the truth about computing .
what is the truth of computing ?
or more simply , how is our computing capacity ?
what is the limit of computing ?
what is compu@@ table and what is un@@ compu@@ table ?
what is an easy computing task and what is a difficult computing task ?
computing can be everywhere , ranging from the basic but profound mathematics to the cutting @-@ edge applications of telecommunication technologies .
including the technologies that have been widely used in our daily life .
from the most objective natural science .
such as physics , chemistry and biology , to social and economic behaviors that are closely associated with our daily life .
computing always plays a key role .
luckily , my research interests overlap with these four dimensions , namely mathematics , science , technology and economics .
so , among my friends and collabor@@ ators .
there are mathemati@@ cians , physic@@ ists , economists , scholars of application of computer science , as well as front@@ line computer programmers and engineers .
you know , these four types of people are totally different in terms of language use and research focus .
it is hard for them to communicate with each other .
but they all communicate well with me and cooperate well with me .
to me , it has proved one thing from a new perspective that computing thinking has its universality .
of course when we take a close look at these four dimensions .
we might feel it much easier to understand the universality among computing thinking , science and technology .
for example , one of the most popular and advanced technologies in physics is Quan@@ tum Information and Quan@@ tum Compu@@ tation .
many governments and high @-@ tech enterprises from China , have invested heavily in this new science .
last year alone , China &apos;s B@@ AT , namely Ali Group , T@@ enc@@ ent and Baidu .
all set up their labs of quantum computing and quantum mechanics .
when we integrate computing with biology , we then have the Bio@@ inform@@ atics Compu@@ ting .
it is needless to say the close connection between computing and technologies .
most high technologies are based on computing or computing science , including the most @-@ talked @-@ about AI and block@@ chain technology .
so , I &apos;m not going to talk about more details on these two aspects in my speech today , as they are relatively easy to understand .
I want to talk about the connection among computing , mathematics and economics .
let &apos;s start from mathematics .
this is David Hil@@ bert , a great mathemati@@ cian from Germany .
well , one of his important contributions was the 23 mathematics questions he raised at the International Congress of Mathem@@ ati@@ cians in Paris in the year 1900 .
his 23 questions , involving different directions in mathematics .
to a large extent stimulated the exciting development of mathematics in the entire 20th century .
many people tried to solve these 23 problems , and ended up creating a lot of new mathematical theories and tools .
but some of these 23 problems still remain un@@ solved today .
I &apos;m going to talk about the 10th question .
the 10th of the total 23 questions .
the question is very simple and easy to understand .
if you attended mathematical Olympi@@ ad class when you were small , or your kid is attending such a class .
the question is this : by giving you any equation , can you figure out whether the equation has any integer solution at all ?
you or your kid might be familiar with mathematical Olympi@@ ad .
and teachers of mathematical Olympi@@ ad will teach you a universal method to deal with special equations .
is there such a universal method to deal with any given equation ?
for example , several days ago , this particular equation went viral in the social media platforms .
I don &apos;t know whether you have seen it or not .
this equation looks neat and simple , and there isn &apos;t anything special about it .
the question is : do these three positive inte@@ gers ABC really exist to make this equation valid ?
why is this equation intriguing ?
it is because these three positive inte@@ gers really exist to make this equation valid .
you can try to figure it out , but I don &apos;t think you can get it done very quickly .
the smallest positive integer for this question looks like this , and I haven &apos;t counted how many digits there yet .
in this example , it is hard to imagine that there is such an equation @-@ based algorithm to deal with a mathematics problem , and it works .
it is true that Hil@@ bert &apos;s 10th question has been solved .
but the way how it is solved is not what Hil@@ bert has expected .
Hil@@ bert expected to find a universal method to solve his question .
however , the current solution is based on computing theory , proving that such a universal method or an algorithm does not exist at all .
the hypothesis is this : I will find a solution to any given equation .
the prof@@ ound@@ ness of mathematics has been full@@ ly revealed when scientists work hard to prove this question of im@@ possibility .
this compu@@ table theory is already a mature theory .
and people are now well aware of compu@@ table questions and un@@ compu@@ table questions .
the modern computing theory has shifted its focus from compu@@ tability to difficulty level of compu@@ tability , also known as the computational complexity .
how do we understand computational complexity ?
it is referred to the duration of time in solving a mathematical question .
I will give you another example of mathematical Olympi@@ ad problems .
by giving you a picture , can you make a un@@ ic@@ urs@@ al illustration ?
what exactly is a un@@ ic@@ urs@@ al illustration ?
for example , there is a piece of paper , with a picture on it .
you place a pen on the paper and draw along those lines without lifting up the pen and repeating the same line .
following these rules , you must try to finish the whole picture .
it might take you a long time to try all the possibilities .
and it will be troublesome if that is a large picture .
is there a simpler method that helps us figure out whether it is viable to have a un@@ ic@@ urs@@ al illustration or not ?
yes , simply put , you need to check every dot within the picture , checking the exact number of connecting lines of this dot .
if a dot has an odd number of connecting lines , we call it a singular point ; otherwise we call it a pair point .
if the entire picture has less than 2 singular points .
then we can draw a un@@ ic@@ urs@@ al illustration .
with the availability of this simple method .
even it is a large picture containing a few hundred dots .
you can figure out the number of singular points and pair points easily , and make your judgment quickly .
if I change the question , and now each dot represents a scenic spot , and this picture becomes a tourist map .
can you visit all the scenic spots without any repetition ?
interesting question , isn &apos;t it ?
in mathematics we call it Hamilton Path Problem .
it is similar to the drawing of a un@@ ic@@ urs@@ al illustration .
as you are not allowed to repeat the same line .
can we solve this problem or not ?
of course you can apply the proof by exhaustion , and try all possible routes .
it will work for this map as well as a smaller map .
however , if this map contains a few hundred dots .
it will take a long time for you to apply the proof by exhaustion and try all possible routes , even with the assistance of the world &apos;s most advanced computers .
the computing process might not end in our lifetime .
the time is too long .
is there a simple solution as that for the un@@ ic@@ urs@@ al illustration ?
actually it is much more complicated than the drawing of un@@ ic@@ urs@@ al illustration .
a mathematical Olympi@@ ad teacher won &apos;t teach the problem @-@ solving method for this question , and even the most capable mathemati@@ cians in the world don &apos;t know how to solve this question .
it still remains as one of 7 most difficult mathematical questions for the 21st century .
if you can find such a simple solution to this question .
you have solved this difficult mathematical question .
you then will be entitled to claim a cash prize worth one million USD .
scholars now try to find out that such kind of simple solution doesn &apos;t exist at all .
if you can prove that such solution doesn &apos;t exist at all .
you are also entitled to claim the same cash prize worth one million USD .
Hamilton Path Problem is not an isolated problem .
there are thousands of problems in the world , bearing different looks .
however , in terms of computational complexity , these problems are the same .
that is to say , when you have found a simple solution to one of these problems .
then you found the answers to all these thousands of problems .
that is why finding a simple solution is so much important .
that is why computational complexity remains as the important focus of theoretical computer science .
so , our goal is to categor@@ ize mathematical questions based on computational complexity .
and by doing so I have tackled many bi@@ partite graph problems .
a bi@@ partite graph may contain many minor problems .
and I need to separate difficult problems from simple problems .
this kind of separation process is very mathematical .
after discussing the connection between mathematics and computing thinking .
we can talk about the integration between computing theory and economics .
I will give you an example easy to understand , which is Ta@@ obao .
when you enter a key word at the official website of Ta@@ obao .
it will produce a list of recommended goods and shops .
from Ta@@ obao &apos;s point of view .
it is designed to offer the best possible customer experience , right ?
Ta@@ obao places high @-@ quality goods and reputable shops at the very beginning of the recommended list .
by doing so , a customer will be able to access valuable shopping experience .
however , for a shop owner .
if his or her shop appears at the very beginning of the recommended list .
it is more likely that their goods will be purchased by customers .
so , for shop owners , the ranking of their shops at the recommended list will decide their profit level .
an important factor for them to improve their income level .
we know that Ta@@ obao has been using a lot of parameters to produce such a recommendation list .
including a shop &apos;s historical sales record and user reviews .
as Ta@@ obao believes that these parameters reflect the quality of products being sold at this shop , right ?
so , because of this reason , many shops end up making up bo@@ gus transactions and mend@@ acious user reviews .
so that their shops will appear at the very beginning of the recommended list .
if more and more shops behave this way , the customer experience will be ruined .
from a computational point of view .
we understand that Ta@@ obao wants to run an algorithm that helps create the best possible customer experience .
however , the data producers , I mean those shops , have their own interests .
and their best interests are to increase their profit level .
but not to improve the customer experience of Ta@@ obao .
during such a process , it is evident that there is a limit for such an algorithm .
in other words , the entered data is not entirely controllable to Ta@@ obao .
at this stage Ta@@ obao &apos;s algorithm has reached a break @-@ even point and the situation has changed . researchers in Ta@@ obao need to think about compu@@ tability , un@@ compu@@ tability , the computational complexity and the limit of compu@@ tability .
I will give you another example from my own research activity .
this is the design of an optimal auction mechanism .
we all know something about an auction , right ?
auction is a very important economic activity .
and there are many economic theories aiming to design an optimal auction mechanism .
from the point of view of a merchant , or a seller of an auction , he or she is expecting the best possible economic return .
and there are many economic studies on this subject matter .
however , these economic studies are all based on an assumption that a seller is well aware of bidders &quot; appra@@ ised prices and the distribution range of these appra@@ ised prices .
however , in the Internet Age , such an assumption is becoming unrealistic .
now more and more goods are sold through the Internet , especially after the introduction of paid listing .
and it is hard to carry out a continuous market research to analyze the distribution range of these appra@@ ised prices .
that is why the per@@ vious economic theories are hard to be applied in the real world .
to address such a problem , theoretical computing scientists first proposed a new optimal auction mechanism in 2001 .
which was a concept based on competitive ratios .
the definition of a competitive ratio is very mathematical .
and I won &apos;t talk further details about it .
the basic idea is that the smaller the competitive ratio , the better economic return the auction mechanism will produce .
in other words , smaller is better .
these scientists proposed an optimal auction model and an optimal auction mechanism in 2001 .
the initial competitive ratio was a relatively large constant , a constant greater than 100 .
later on , many economists , mathemati@@ cians and computer scientists made efforts to improve this mechanism and lower the competitive ratio .
the figure was lowered from 15 to almost 4 , and researchers kept improving the competitive ratio .
and finally they produced 3.@@ 12 , believing that it was the optimal competitive ratio .
is there a limit for this kind of improvement ?
in the year 2004 , some scientists claimed that competitive ratio could never be smaller than 2.@@ 42 .
however , there was still room between 2.@@ 42 and 3.@@ 12 .
and scientists didn &apos;t know what measures needed to be taken to bridge the gap .
I worked with two other researchers , and we proved that it was viable to lower the competitive ratio to 2.@@ 42 .
and the optimal competitive ratio was 2.@@ 42 .
we have proved that an optimal auction model with a 2.@@ 42 competitive ratio is the optimal auction mechanism .
thus solving a problem that has ling@@ ered for over 10 years .
we have mentioned two examples , namely Ta@@ obao ranking and the auction mechanism design .
and these similar cases have helped give birth to a new discipline called Com@@ put@@ ational Economics .
computational Economics covers a lot of topics .
such as market , market price prediction and market equilibrium among others .
when the market grows bigger and bigger , the computational complexity becomes a new constraint for the new economics .
as there isn &apos;t such a concept of computational complexity in the previous economics .
back to this picture once again .
we are discussing the connection among computing thinking , mathematics , science , economics and technology .
the connection between mathematics and computing science enables us to see the pro@@ fun@@ dity of the theory .
the connection between computing theory and natural sciences allows us to see the computational complexity .
the concept of computing really exists in the world of physics and affects the laws of the universe .
it is real , not just an intellectual game we have invented .
the connection between computing theory and sociology enables us to see the universality of computing theory .
and on the other hand , we have witnessed the rapid development of computer @-@ science @-@ based information technology .
which has greatly changed our lives and ways of production .
it only again proves the usefulness of these computational tools .
pro@@ fun@@ dity , real@@ ness , universality and usefulness , these are what computing thinking and computing theory appear in my mind .
and it is also the reason why I have been addicted to such a discipline for more than 10 years .
I believe that , from this computational perspective , we can better understand our world .
be it the physical world or our human society .
by using computing tools .
we are able to do a better job in transforming our world and creating a better future .
thank you .
good evening everyone . I am Zhang Jun , an Kun@@ ju performer of the Xia@@ os@@ h@@ eng role . I would like to send my regards to all the Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u audience here tonight .
can you understand what I was saying ?
awesome !
please accept my humble respect . &quot;
this is my usual opening remarks .
on the one hand , on new stages , it is better to test my voice .
as performers , we feel physi@@ ologically and psych@@ ologically assured as long as our voice is in a good state .
on the other hand , &quot; Please accept my humble &quot; it is an expression of sincere gratitude from me .
thank you for joining us , thank you for coming to Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u Talk .
thank you for sitting here and listening to the story of a Xia@@ os@@ h@@ eng performer .
you presence would kin@@ dle our imagination , warming up our gathering today .
your participation would breath new life into the ancient culture of Kun@@ qu .
at this point , I feel more clearly that you participation will determine our future .
Kun@@ qu is an art that deserves your participation .
why ?
because it is unique enough .
do you know what the lead mel@@ odic instrument of Peking Opera is ?
Hu@@ q@@ in .
what is the major mel@@ odic instrument of Shanghai Opera ?
Hu@@ q@@ in .
what is the major mel@@ odic instrument of Yue Opera ?
Hu@@ q@@ in .
what is the major mel@@ odic instrument of Yu Opera ?
Hu@@ q@@ in .
what about Hebei bang@@ zi ?
Hu@@ q@@ in .
what about Wu@@ xi opera ?
Hu@@ q@@ in .
what about Hu@@ ai@@ ju opera ?
Hu@@ q@@ in .
the lead mel@@ odic instrument of most Chinese operas is Hu@@ q@@ in .
in my view , the traditional Chinese operas using Hu@@ q@@ in as the mel@@ odic instrument that follow the ban@@ q@@ iang style are actually the &quot; pop music &quot; in traditional operas .
the melody is the key and should be remembered with ease .
pop music has easily sing@@ able melo@@ dies .
Kun@@ qu is known as &quot; Q@@ up@@ ai style &quot; and is compared to Beethoven , Mozart and B@@ ach in Chinese traditional opera .
a little applause here would be great .
Kun@@ qu belongs to classical music .
why ?
because classical music is complicated enough .
Kun@@ qu uses di@@ zi as its lead mel@@ odic instrument , which is quite special comparing to the operas that use Hu@@ q@@ in .
so the difference lies not only in the genre but also the texture .
Kun@@ qu is called &quot; The ancestor of the hundred plays . &quot;
what a great name !
it is as subtle as Kun@@ qu itself .
I admire the English translation .
&quot; Kun@@ qu is the mother of Chinese operas . &quot;
you know what is mother .
indeed , Kun@@ qu is the mother of Chinese operas , the ancestor of the hundred plays , with a history of six hundred years .
where did it come from 600 years ago ?
it is so special and it originated in Kun@@ shan , Jiangsu province .
during the late Yuan to the early Ming Dynasty six hundreds years ago , The tune of N@@ anxi in the Kun@@ shan region , Jiangsu province .
was extended to the Kun@@ shan tune .
which does not mean that Kun@@ qu is a regional opera .
in the following two hundred years , it was passed from generation to generation .
during the Jia@@ jing period of the Ming Dynasty .
Wei Li@@ ang@@ fu and other musicians reformed and developed the tune for decades and the plain Kun@@ shan tune was finally reformed to the Shu@@ im@@ o tune .
as for the two hundreds years from the Middle Ming Dynasty to the Middle Qing Dynasty .
professor Yu Qi@@ u@@ yu had an adequate remark on it .
&quot; Kun@@ qu dominated the collective aesthetic consciousness of the Chinese people for two hundreds years . &quot;
speaking of collective aesthetic consciousness .
what does the term &quot; collective &quot; refer to ?
it means that Kun@@ qu fitted the aesthetic taste of people at different strat@@ ums of the society .
by the Middle Qing Dynasty .
almost two hundred and twenty years ago , Kun@@ qu began to decline slowly .
in my view , it was the involvement of the intellectual that made Kun@@ qu@@ n more exclusive in terms of the knowledge required for its audience .
at that time , more than two hundred years ago , perhaps a more vulgar art style was necessary .
so Peking opera , the qu@@ int@@ essence of China , was developed by combining the style of Hui opera , Han opera and Kun@@ q@@ iang .
we call Kun@@ qu the &quot; Grand@@ mother of Chinese operas . &quot;
indeed , it has a very long history .
in the following two hundred years , Kun@@ qu experienced ups and downs .
sometimes it faded out of our sights .
sometimes it came back .
fortunately , it is still developing despite all the hardships .
then where does the time @-@ honored Kun@@ qu melo@@ dies accompanied by di@@ zi come from ?
it is so unique because it stem@@ med from the literature .
the tune patterns of Ban@@ qi@@ ang@@ ti can go with different lyrics .
offering a popular , easy and convenient way to express our emotions directly .
Kun@@ qu cannot work this way because of its uniqueness .
if one wants to write a piece of k@@ un@@ qu , take a chapter from &quot; The Jade H@@ air@@ pin &quot; wrote by Mr. Gao L@@ ian in 15@@ 70 as example .
there are twenty or thirty excer@@ pts in this play , one of them is called &quot; F@@ li@@ r@@ t With The Z@@ ither . &quot;
what is &quot; F@@ li@@ r@@ t With The Z@@ ither &quot; about ?
it is the story of a young scholar called Pan B@@ iz@@ h@@ eng .
he failed the imperial examination and was reluctant to go back home .
so he see@@ ked lodging at a temple his aunt was in charge of .
there he met a beautiful girl who disguised as a n@@ un .
she was actually from a big family and was taking refuge at the temple from the war .
please note that in the Kun@@ ju scripts .
if a man fails the imperial examination , it is not a big deal .
because romance will come soon .
&quot; when one door closes , another opens . &quot;
this is a typical plot in traditional Kun@@ qu .
this excer@@ pt depicts his crush on the girl after their encounter .
what is &quot; F@@ li@@ r@@ t With The Z@@ ither &quot; ?
it is to pass on am@@ orous feelings by playing seven str@@ inged zi@@ thers to each other , a very subtle way of flir@@ ting .
why ?
they communicated by seven str@@ inged zi@@ thers because there was no We@@ Chat nor Wei@@ bo at that time .
this play was written in 15@@ 70 .
if we were to write this story .
we would have to start from the lyrics .
Kun@@ qu Opera has an unique system of verses .
it is called the &quot; Q@@ up@@ ai system . &quot;
what is Q@@ up@@ ai system ?
we have to choose one from the 4,@@ 4@@ 66 mel@@ odic models or two or from the three hundred sets of commonly used fixed tunes .
to suit the logic and emotional expression requirements of &quot; F@@ li@@ r@@ t With The Z@@ ither . &quot;
Gao L@@ ian chose the pattern of &quot; Lan@@ hu@@ ame@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Lan@@ hu@@ ame@@ i &quot; is a gu@@ pa@@ i of Nan@@ qu opera .
what is a gu@@ pa@@ i pattern like ?
it means the performers sing alternately .
flir@@ t With The Z@@ ither used four excer@@ pts of the gu@@ pa@@ i pattern Lan@@ hu@@ ame@@ i and four of The Wor@@ ship Song .
so there are in total eight segments .
such tune patterns were set by the fore@@ runners .
there are strict rules on what to include in each passage , how to perform each passage , and in what order these passages are performed .
there are some general rules .
in this sense , Kun@@ qu is so unique .
the second unique feature lies in the details .
Lan@@ hu@@ ame@@ i has its own t@@ onal pattern and mel@@ odic model and has only five lines .
look at this example , one two three four five , five lines in total .
the number of words in each line is 7 , 7 , 7 , 6 and 7 respectively .
some of you may say the number of words in this passage is 7 , 7 , 7 , 5 , and 7 .
it is acceptable to miss one word .
however , if the number of words in each line is 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 8 .
then the passage cannot be called &quot; Lan@@ hu@@ ame@@ i &quot; anymore .
in addition , the lines should rhyme .
note that the last syll@@ ables of each word rhyme with each other .
they are the Chinese character &quot; N@@ ong &quot; &quot; Qi@@ ong &quot; &quot; Feng &quot; &quot; Meng &quot; and &quot; Hong . &quot;
if we write &quot; F@@ li@@ r@@ t With The Z@@ ither &quot; with a certain tune .
then the last syll@@ ables of each word in all the 8 passages in the 45 @-@ minute play have to rhyme with each other .
this is a very strict and unique rule .
the consecutive lines must rhyme and form anti@@ thesis .
read it out and feel it yourselves , &quot; The moon is clear , the clouds are thin .
the flowers are prof@@ use with colors and dew . I lean on my pillow full of worry , listening to the cr@@ ic@@ kets around the walls . &quot;
the two lines must both have a single internal rhyme and all the passages follow the conventional t@@ onal pattern overall .
the rules are so unique and strict in the mean time and we should obey them .
it is not enough to just obey the pattern .
it would be worthless and meaningless if we cannot fully express ourselves with this pattern .
emotions could still be thoroughly expressed despite the strict rules on composing .
the moon is clear , the clouds are thin . the flowers are prof@@ use with colors and dew .
I lean on my pillow full of worry , listening to the cr@@ ic@@ kets around the walls .
do you know what does the word &quot; Qi@@ ong &quot; mean ?
it means &quot; gras@@ shoppers &quot; or &quot; cr@@ ic@@ kets &quot; in classical Chinese .
I lean on my pillow full of worry , listening to the cr@@ ic@@ kets around the walls .
time , location , and environment of the event are vividly depicted .
the third line is even more beautiful .
it is an all@@ usion , &quot; sadd@@ ened by autumn , Song Yu sings to the west wind . &quot;
those of you who are fond of classical culture may find this all@@ usion familiar .
however , when I first read the lines , I was still young to understand them .
later , I learnt that &quot; Song Yu &quot; was not a jade from the Song Dynasty .
it was the name of a man , a student of Qu Yuan and a literature master of Ver@@ ses of Chu .
who wrote a number of poems in the Fu genre .
his &quot; Deng Tu@@ zi The lu@@ st@@ ful &quot; is one of my favorites .
among the beau@@ ties in the state of Chu , none are comparable to those in my ham@@ let .
among the beau@@ ties in my ham@@ let , none are comparable to the daughter of my eastern neighbor . &quot;
these lines may be familiar to most of us .
another masterpiece by him is called &quot; Xi Feng Fu . &quot;
which depicted his melanch@@ olic expressions in the fall .
the author of the play described the melanch@@ olic mood of Pan B@@ iz@@ h@@ eng .
who chose to write his sorrow into a poem as Song Yu did in &quot; Xi Feng Fu &quot; and wished the west wind would carry the sorrow away .
this is an all@@ usion .
an adequate all@@ usion has the magic to touch our heart , so people could relate and understand it .
in a way , those of us who are not into the classical Chinese and traditional culture will become more and more unfamiliar to these allu@@ sions .
as performers of Kun@@ qu , we are privileged to be closer to the traditional culture .
so we would like to share these special excer@@ pts with you .
the falling leaves star@@ tle my unfinished dream , I count the flowers on the ground .
I feel like I am following the path of that girl while gathering the fallen fall leaves .
these beautiful verses , strict t@@ onal patterns , the rig@@ or and the freedom .
all together created such a splendid work that has been recorded in this way .
this is g@@ ong@@ che notation , a special way of recording .
it can also be sung , in a mel@@ odious tune .
three years after I entered a Kun@@ qu School .
I still did not know why I had chosen to perform Kun@@ qu .
as a farmer &apos;s child who entered this new world .
I was at a completely loss .
until I learned this song , a typical Nan@@ qu &apos;s pent@@ at@@ onic scale song .
it is so soft , quiet , and romantic .
after learning this song .
I finally made peace with myself , Kun@@ qu and the audience sitting in front of me .
therefore , I think I should sing this passage of &quot; Lan@@ hu@@ ame@@ i &quot; for you .
the lyrics and melody were written in 15@@ 50 and stayed the same since then .
now , with the leading efforts of Mr.@@ Peng Cheng , the excer@@ pt is interpreted in a new way .
we call this style of performance the &quot; Kun@@ plug . &quot;
Peng Cheng is the composer of &quot; Serious Snow &quot; sung by X@@ ue Zhi@@ q@@ ian and the ly@@ rist of &quot; Batt@@ le@@ field for the youthful &quot; for the talent show &quot; My Her@@ o . &quot;
you probably are quite familiar with these two songs .
he is also the ly@@ rist of &quot; No. 87 of Xia@@ Fei Road . &quot;
he is the music director of &quot; Kun@@ plug . &quot;
he has composed dozens of such songs .
trying to wake up some far away music styles , melo@@ dies and memories with his musical ideals .
in the seven years since the &quot; Kun@@ plug &quot; was born .
we started from performing in a small hall and twenty days from now on .
we will be performing in Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z Center that holds tens of thousands people .
with your encouragement , we are moving forward step by step .
why ?
there is not much time left for us to save Kun@@ qu .
do you know how many theatre companies are there in China ?
there are 10,@@ 28@@ 7 in China .
how many Kun@@ qu opera companies are there ?
only nine .
how many private opera companies are there in China ?
there are 8@@ 7@@ 54 private opera companies in total .
over 1,200 of them are private Yu@@ e@@ ju Opera trou@@ pes in the countryside of Zhejiang province .
why there are so many of them ?
because it has a big audience and lots of fans .
do you know how many private Kun@@ qu Opera trou@@ pes are there ?
just one .
that is mine .
there is only one now , and we probably do not need more in the future .
after all , without enough audiences , the trou@@ pe will not survive .
then , there is no use to have more .
we will have a concert in front of a 10,000 people on May 18th .
do you know why we chose the date May 18th ?
because it sounds auspicious and we want to be more successful .
I was just joking .
the true reason is that 18th of May marks an extremely special day for Kun@@ qu .
do you know how many intangible cultural herit@@ ages of humanity are there in the world ?
3@@ 89
the list got longer last year .
three names on that list impressed me deeply .
fal@@ con@@ ry in Germany , the craft of the mil@@ ler operating wind@@ mills and water@@ mills of the Netherlands and pizza spinning of Naples are all on the list .
do you know what was first one listed as a M@@ aster@@ piece of the Or@@ al and In@@ tangible Heritage in the world ?
on May 18 , 2001 , Kun@@ ju was the first to be included as the M@@ aster@@ pieces of the Or@@ al and In@@ tangible Heritage of Human@@ ity by UNESCO .
it topped all the 19 categories that participated .
17 years have passed since then .
it has been 17 years .
17 years .
at that time , my mentor , our manager , Cai Zhen@@ gre@@ n , came back to tell us about this news .
he said the first good news is that we were attracting attention .
as the first on the list of M@@ aster@@ pieces of the Or@@ al and In@@ tangible Heritage of Human@@ ity by UNESCO .
we would definitely get more attention and help .
indeed , our company stopped borrowing money to pay the performers after the news .
however , note that meanwhile the bad news is we are considered as a &quot; heritage . &quot;
we all know what &quot; heritage &quot; means .
for 17 years , we started from performing in a small hall to the Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ ze Center that holds tens of thousands people .
what is our purpose ?
we just want to prove that Kun@@ qu is still alive .
why are we doing this in 20@@ 18 ?
we have been doing just one thing during the past 20 years .
that is going into the crowd to share with people what Kun@@ qu is .
I remember going on a performance in 1997 when I was fresh out of school .
we were going to perform Kun@@ qu like what we are doing tonight , four beautiful excer@@ pts .
however , at that time , Kun@@ qu had a rather small audience .
we were performing at a science and engineering college and there were some teachers , medi@@ as and students .
the president of the university locked the door up to keep the audience from leaving halfway .
then the show began .
the first one was a martial arts drama and was very lively .
there were many f@@ lips .
the second show was &quot; Pe@@ ony Pavilion , &quot; an all @-@ time classic .
after watching the show for twenty minutes .
the students started to get confused , wondering what the story was about .
well , we cannot blame them .
it was hard for them to understand the beauty of lines &quot; Why does Heaven give us brilliant day and dazzling sight ? whose house could boast of a swee@@ ter delight ? &quot;
in addition , most of them had to prepare for the examination next day .
but sorry , you can &apos;t get out .
the doors were all locked .
there was one door left open , but it led to a wall .
what the president did not expect was that the wall was recently under renovation and was partly removed .
so when the &quot; Pe@@ ony Pavilion &quot; was finished .
most of the students left by climbing over the wall .
the reporters followed the escaping audience .
the next day there was an article called &quot; Now , you have to jump off the wall to escape from a Kun@@ qu performance . &quot;
for heaven &apos;s sake !
this is what we had been learning !
this experience led me to find a new way of interpreting Kun@@ qu , a way to which the younger generation can relate .
on December 19th , 1998 , in the ar@@ ched auditorium of Tong@@ ji University .
we used our own methods and created a way to interpret the five characters of Kun@@ qu : Sheng , Dan , Jin , Mo , and Ch@@ ou .
we presented its performing techniques : singing , rec@@ iting , sitting , and fli@@ pping .
we explained the difference roles like Xia@@ os@@ h@@ eng , La@@ os@@ h@@ eng , and W@@ ush@@ eng and the reason why Xia@@ os@@ h@@ eng is fur@@ th@@ ur divided into Jin Sheng , Guan Sheng , Qi@@ ong Sheng and Zhi@@ wei Sheng .
that night , the 2,500 young student audience echoed with us .
no one left the auditorium halfway , and the appl@@ a@@ uses were so aloud that it nearly turned over the roof of the ar@@ ched auditorium .
after the show was over , some audience took our poster and rushed to the back stage , talking to us about Kun@@ qu and asking for our signatures . the audiences blocked the back stage .
Oh my god !
I had my idols and I was once a fan .
and now someone is asking for my signature !
we were so inspired that day .
because we finally found our own way to interpret the art that we love to our peers .
a way that was explored and controlled by ourselves .
it has been twenty years since that day .
we hope that in the next 20 years .
with your company and encouragement , Kun@@ qu will be even more prosperous .
because we have proven with our 20 years &apos; effort that the 100 year @-@ old Yu@@ e@@ ju Opera is mainly watched by the mom@@ s .
the 200 year @-@ old Beijing Opera is mainly watched by the fathers .
while the 600 year @-@ old Kun@@ qu Opera is now watched by the young generation .
rather than saying that we have an ambition to stand on a stage in front of a 10 000 crowd .
it is more accurate to say that during the past two decades , under your encouragement .
we have finally found the courage to step up on this larger stage to welcome the next 20 years with confidence .
therefore , we earnestly invite you to join us and protect what we have achieved together .
there have been no absolute increases in the numbers of Kun@@ qu opera performers since the founding of the People &apos; Republic of China .
however , our audience are so young and enthusiastic .
you have made this possible .
let us do something together ， preserving something for the generation to come .
Kun@@ qu has gone through ups and downs .
now , with the fast growing information technology .
it is again under the threat of becoming endangered .
where is Kun@@ qu &apos;s position ?
where are we ?
is it on Dou@@ yin ?
is it on B@@ ili@@ bil@@ i ?
I do not know .
we do not know how to find the position .
please come to help us .
help us to have Kun@@ qu heard at a higher level , in a larger scale and in a wil@@ der space .
what is the meaning of a concert or decades of routine practicing ?
what is the purpose ?
is it for the rewarding moment up on the stage ?
I was told that we have sold more than 6,000 tickets .
and we need another 3,000 audience to fill the theater .
is this important for us ?
it is important , but it is more than that .
we kept thinking about what Kun@@ qu Opera was .
what is art ?
I was deeply impressed by what Mr. Tao Ye said .
in fact , art and Kun@@ qu offer an access to the essence of life .
life is very ordinary .
we practiced our skills for over 30 years , acting in different plays .
hoping to be remembered with some dazzling moments and spectacular roles .
however , in fact , we did not truly understand the meaning and the value of the stage .
it was not until 2015 that we had an opportunity for such a play .
do you know this poet called Zhang Ru@@ ox@@ u ?
he was among the more than 2,@@ 300 poets , in the Tang Dynasty that had a magnificent history of 28@@ 9 years .
there are over 50,000 poems passed down from the Tang Dynasty , 10@@ 10 by Li Bai , 14@@ 00 by Du Fu .
do you know how many poems Zhang Ru@@ ox@@ u wrote ?
just one .
this poem is thought as &quot; top@@ ping all the other poems in the Tang Dynasty . &quot;
however , Zhang Ru@@ ox@@ u is a person with no story .
how can someone who has no story write such a thought @-@ provoking poem ?
I especially loved the last two lines of the third passage , &quot; Who by the river@@ side first saw the moon arise ?
when did the moon first see a man by river@@ side ? &quot;
Mr. Wen Y@@ id@@ uo said that this poem reflected human &apos;s thinking about the universe .
in the early Tang Dynasty , the literature style began to change .
the authors dw@@ elled both inside and outside their poems .
however , Zhang Ru@@ ox@@ u has no story .
seven or eight years ago , a 28 @-@ year @-@ old play@@ w@@ right , who was born in 1981 , wrote a Kun@@ qu opera script in 13 days .
he wrote a story enti@@ ti@@ led &quot; B@@ los@@ s@@ oms on a Mo@@ on@@ lit River in Spring &quot; for Zhang Ru@@ ox@@ u , a romance story .
at the age of 27 , on 16th of the first month of the lunar year , on a moon@@ lit bridge in Yang@@ zhou , Zhang Ru@@ ox@@ u met the girl he loved .
at that time he was 27 years old , the girl was 16 years old .
they met for the second time on 16th of the first month of the lunar year on a moon@@ lit bridge in Yang@@ zhou .
this time , Zhang Ru@@ ox@@ u was still 27 years old while the girl was 26 years old .
they met for the third time on 16th of the first month of the lunar year on a moon@@ lit bridge in Yang@@ zhou .
this time , Zhang Ru@@ ox@@ u was still 27 years old while the girl was already 66 years old .
after 50 years &apos; obsession , standing in front of the girl he loved , Zhang Ru@@ ox@@ u instantly came to realize the relationship he had with the time .
this work and your company led me to understand that the ultimate goal of art is to engage with people .
some people around us left .
my father never had the chance to see this play .
I will sing it at the coming concert , and Mr. Li Qu@@ an will sing with me .
why ?
because I want to see the people I love come back .
I was not satisfied with my performance in the scene when the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Zhang Ru@@ ox@@ u saw his 66 years old lover and their eyes met .
I did not understand the essence of life and time , the meaning of arts until my father passed away .
when I was performing &quot; B@@ los@@ s@@ oms on a Mo@@ on@@ lit River in Spring &quot; at the Hong Kong Arts Festival .
when our eyes met , I suddenly felt as if my soul had left my body .
one line of script from this play suddenly occurs to me , &quot; Through the narrow path of life and death , we finally meet again after this long period of separation . &quot;
all forms of great art can give us a chance to re@@ unite after separation .
join us and create such opportunities for the younger generation to come .
let us move forward together so that we will never be alone again .
let us see each other and feel our life .
let us meet again !
let us re@@ unite after a long time of separation !
let us meet only to love the ones we love again .
I invite all of you to join us .
your participation will determine our future .
thank you !
good morning , everyone .
I &apos;m P@@ ang Wei .
last year , there was a famous dog called &quot; Al@@ pha Go . &quot;
it beat almost all Go players and made artificial intelligence a buzz word .
not only does Arti@@ ficial intelligence defeat human players in Go matches .
they are changing every aspects of our society and facilitating the development of various industries .
tourism is not an exception .
what I &apos;m gonna share with you today is the data intelligence behind the travel footprint .
let &apos;s have a look at what data and artificial intelligence can do in tourism .
we love traveling and visiting many places .
we love to go to the seaside , climb high mountains , go to different bust@@ ling cities and quiet country@@ sides and so on .
we encounter lots of people during traveling and loads of stories take place .
some people even find their better half during traveling .
with the development of the Internet and the mobile Internet , we can manage traveling on an AP@@ P .
before going on a trip , you would go on the Internet to search for some travel tips to help you decide where to go .
you can find out about the local interests , book tickets , hotels and flights on the AP@@ P .
in this way , we do not only leave our footprints on the mountains and rivers , but also online .
what are the online footprints ?
they &apos;re a at@@ ually data .
what kind of data do we generate in our traveling ?
large amounts of data are generated when you book tickets and use various services .
the cities you visited , the hotels you stayed in and the prices , which I know , are structured data and transaction data .
we also know that , while you &apos;re using the AP@@ P , how long you have stayed on one web page and which link you have clicked .
all your moves are tracked in the system .
these are the behavioral data and they &apos;re half @-@ structured .
there are lots of hotel pictures on the website .
you may also write reviews and travel notes during traveling .
these large amount of image , text , video and audio data are all non @-@ structured data .
what do these data tell us ?
there &apos;re a few examples .
now the information flow is a hot topic .
many of us access information on Tou@@ ti@@ ao or Baidu and we &apos;re waiting for the notifications at any time .
however , while in traveling , the majority of us would use search engines .
and more than half of us search for necessary information or places of interest .
online searching plays an essential role in traveling .
let &apos;s think about this , what do people care about the most when they book a hotel ?
most people care about the location .
about 37 % of people care about the rating .
and there are also about 10 % of people who care about the price .
so locations , ratings and prices are the most important factors in choosing a hotel .
let &apos;s talk a bit about reviews .
we would have a look at the reviews while shopping on Ta@@ obao and booking a hotel .
so reviews are a very important factor in choosing a hotel .
few people would choose the hotel whose rating goes below 4 .
let &apos;s have another look at the competition situation among hotels .
you would never have the idea that one would compare an average of 80 hotels for a trip to S@@ anya , 22 hotels for a trip to Chengdu , and 25 for Chongqing .
therefore , the competition is fierce among hotels in tour@@ istic cities .
besides , traveling used to be a tricky thing .
many people would do research on hotels and flights months beforehand to figure out the best plan .
whereas now travel becomes more casual and flexible .
and more than half of people would book the hotel and check in at the same time on the day when arriving .
next , let &apos;s look at the different requirements of men and women .
what do people care about when booking a hotel ?
most men care more about breakfast when booking a hotel , which we are not surprised to know .
but for women , they pay more attention to the landscape and interior lay@@ outs .
we &apos;re not surprised .
what I mentioned just now was only a few statistics .
these data tell us lots of interesting information , and people began to use data many years ago .
statistics is the initial application .
then there is machine learning and various kinds of predictions .
search engines and the Internet perhaps represent the first application of data on a large scale .
in recent years , with the development of deep learning .
machine has grasped more capabilities that mainly reflect in three aspects .
the first aspect is the identification and understanding of images .
the second aspect is the understanding of the natural language and processing of the texts .
the third is the understanding of the voice and videos .
with these capabilities , the application of data has become quite different .
let &apos;s go back to the data in tourism that we mentioned just now .
tourism is a fun industry .
compared with online retailers who would only persuade you into shopping .
while traveling is more complicated .
it involves accommodation , transportation , locations , entertainment , catering and all other daily aspects .
what does a complete scenario of tourism mean ?
it indicates that we ha@@ ved ata of a full scenario .
we know how many people fly from Beijing to Shanghai and we know how many people check in at a certain hotel in San Francisco .
with exterior data , we even know the weather is good in Shanghai and Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u TA@@ L@@ K is taking place in the Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z A@@ rena .
these are the macro data .
how about the micro data ?
we actually know everyone &apos;s lik@@ ings .
what does he like to do ?
some people like beaches , some like cities , some like luxurious hotels , some like outdoor adventures and some like going hiking .
do we also know the characteristics of different merchants ?
some hotels provide good services , while some does quiet the contrary .
by combining all these data and the application of AI algorithms , the brain of tourism is created .
this brain exc@@ els at many things and it helps merchants to provide better services .
it also helps individuals .
it simpli@@ fies the way we make decisions by making it quick and easy and improve our traveling experience while we &apos;re on travel .
and it helps the customer service personnel to provide new services .
here is a specific example .
there is a huge difference between travel products and e @-@ commerce products
just think about it , a room in a Hilton hotel in Shanghai might be 1000 yuan for one night .
how much is it worth after midnight ?
zero .
because the time has already passed , and nobody books the room .
how much is a flight from Shanghai to San Francisco ?
probably from 3000 yuan to more than 100@@ 00 yuan .
if the airline company fails to sell a certain seat and the time has passed .
then how much is it worth ?
zero .
hence , yield management is very important in tourism industry .
for small hotels that can &apos;t afford to hire professional yield managers .
the owner might consider lifting the price in the peak season and dropping the price in the slack season .
for high @-@ end hotels such as Mar@@ ri@@ ott and Hilton .
they would hire a professional with a master &apos;s degree or doc@@ torate degree in economics to act as the yield manager .
the price will be regulated in a dynamic way according to the relationship between supply and demand .
however , most companies don &apos;t do well in those aspects , why ?
because they don &apos;t have the data .
the only data they might have is the history record of their hotels .
and they may get to know with the information they could gather .
like March might be a peak season in this city since the cherry tree is in blossom , and therefore tourists would come for a visit .
but this hotel doesn &apos;t have the full @-@ scenario tour@@ istic data we talked about .
it &apos;s hard to make a precise estimate on the relationship between supply and demand .
the &quot; brain of tourism &quot; could help those hotels and airline companies precisely with the full @-@ scenario data and advanced algorithms .
one more thing is that , although you know the macro data and you know you don &apos;t have enough of these data .
since most of the time you &apos;re in a circle of competition , how to make a comparison and an analysis between your data and those of your competitors is essential .
therefore the brain of tourism energi@@ zes this industry through the data analysis and the release of the data capacity .
this is the help to the industry . let &apos;s have another look at its help to the individual .
the data we &apos;re going to talk about is the transaction data we &apos;ve just mentioned .
that is , for any individual , we know the hotels you &apos;ve stayed in , your favorite hotel ratings , the prices and the services you like .
some people are sensitive to the price .
while some are sensitive to the time .
how do we get the behavioral history and transaction history ?
then by combining the other end .
we know the services provided by different hotels , customers &apos; satisfaction and their reviews .
we also know the punctu@@ ality rate of airline companies .
we can help our users to find the products they needed in a quick and easy way by combining these two data and through the recommended algorithms .
this is an example of intelligent recommendation .
let &apos;s take a look at the example of text processing .
the majority of hotels have the standard information which tells you its location , the prices , the rating and the level of services .
this information is very useful .
we normally use this information for judgement when booking hotels .
while actually there are lots of hidden but useful information about a hotel that we don &apos;t normally know .
and you only read reviews for particular aspects you are concerned about .
for example , is the breakfast in this hotel good ?
or does the waiter wear a lovely smile ?
some people may be particularly concerned about these .
for example , there are hanging seats on the balcony .
which only a minority of people would care about .
as a matter of fact , algorithm plays an important role in how do we give the statistics and information to this minority of people .
there &apos;s an example about pictures and short videos .
everybody knows that short videos are in vogue these days .
whether it is Dou@@ yin or Ku@@ a@@ ish@@ ou , our new social networking sof@@ tw@@ ares are displayed with short videos .
however , not every hotel is able to make nice short videos .
but every hotel would provide a lot of pictures of the hotel .
like we &apos;ve just mentioned .
the latest development end@@ ows us with three new capacities , one of which is the identification of pictures .
so we would gather the relevant pictures online , via data mining .
what does the new algorithm do ?
it studies the pixel , which is the original information .
and it works out the specific outline through the further study of the pixel .
through the outline , it studies the different parts and components .
finally there comes a question , what does this picture say ?
to apply the concept to the scene just now .
we would know that : this is a picture of the hotel lobby , there is a bathroom in it and there is a distant view outside the window .
with the awareness and the knowledge of these pictures .
our another algorithm would judge the aesthetic degree of each picture .
will people like this picture ?
after the judgement on the aesthetic degree and the content of the picture , what do we do ?
we would create a play or a short video .
the video includes several parts .
certain pictures are used for each part and segment , and a small video is made .
the user will know what the hotel is like in a dozen seconds in a quick and easy way .
it further means that it shor@@ tens the time for the user to get information .
this is the example about the picture .
let &apos;s look at the customer services .
customer services are an ancient industry .
especially in traveling , we needs lots of services .
in fact , it &apos;s very hard to substitute these services with artificial intelligence .
what are the information and knowledge included in the customer services ?
we have an enormous and complex knowledge map .
the knowledge map tells you that you need to apply for a visa if you want to travel abroad .
this map will tell you that the cherry trees are in blossom in certain place and certain season .
this map will tell you that hotel might suit you best .
the map was created by combining all the data , information and the algorithms .
what can this map do ?
if you &apos;d like to go travel but don &apos;t know where to go .
it will recommend some tourist destinations for you .
after you &apos;ve decided where to go , it recommends the hotels and flights to you .
after you book your flights and hotels , there might be some little unexpected situations .
for example , there is an urgent meeting and I need to res@@ chedule my ticket .
this map will do it for you .
when booking a hotel , you might encounter other problems .
after arriving at a place and checking in .
you might want to know what &apos;s fun around the hotel .
you may even want to find a local guide or some local friends .
with the support of such a huge and strong knowledge domains map .
the AI customer service can do everything for you .
the examples mentioned are very practical .
that is , data and algorithm can make your travel easier and create better experience for you .
traveling takes us far away , but most of the time not only do we desire the world beyond but also the poetry .
a little poetry machine can be created through the knowledge domains map to write a poem for you .
so not only does it help you explore the world beyond but also the poetry .
all these examples show that data can make travel and your experience better .
however , data are also a double @-@ edged sword .
if you &apos;ve seen all these films about Super Her@@ o .
whether it &apos;s Sp@@ ider @-@ Man or Super@@ man , there &apos;s a saying that more power means more responsibility , right ?
in fact , more data also means more responsibilities .
in this era of data , in fact , every enterprise has a large amount of user data .
which can be used to improve the user experience .
but if the data is not used well , it can be dangerous if it is not properly used .
well , let &apos;s share some revel@@ ations and applications in these areas .
what does transparency mean ?
that is to say , each of us should have the right to know what kind of data of yours have been collected and how the data will be used when it is accessed by this product .
all this information should be transparent to you .
you shouldn &apos;t be under the circumstance where you don &apos;t know your data are collected .
and then the results are that you receive a lot of advertising information , a lot of calls from real estate agents , and a lot of harassment .
that &apos;s an example of people exploiting data and algorithms with no restr@@ aints .
which we hope to avoid .
the second one is data security .
you may have heard today about a major incident lately .
which is the data leakage of Facebook .
after getting the user &apos;s data , how can we make it secure ?
where should we store the data ?
how do we encryp@@ t sensitive information ?
how do we control access to this data ?
these are the very important points that every enterprise , every data person and algorith@@ mist , should consider .
third , humanity .
so we can see that this is a person , this is a person in a world of data .
then think about what these people represent ?
these people actually represent you , me and everyone of us who is full of vitality and energy in real life .
in a world of data , when we are transferring data to products and companies .
we are in fact communicating our personality and vitality .
so in this case , what should we do when we get the data ?
do we use the cold algorithm to deal with those of us in the dynamic data world ?
we think this is wrong .
we think that AI should be warm .
another example .
as we just said , AI customer service can provide you with a very good experience and help you do a lot of things .
but there are many scenes where we don &apos;t really like to chat with a robot .
we still want hope that behind the customer service and the products , there are real people .
this person may not only feel my needs , but also my emotions .
in some particularly urgent situations , AI still has a lot of limits .
for example , I work in C@@ trip .
a lot of incidents happened in the whole travel industry last year .
we witnessed the Jiu@@ z@@ ha@@ ig@@ ou earthquake , the shooting in Las Vegas .
and many disasters that were not supposed to happen to human beings .
some of our tourists and our customers happened to be involved in these disasters .
artificial intelligence helps us to better locate their situation and get their information .
but artificial intelligence can &apos;t help us to rescue them from such a dilemma and take him back to his home where he left .
at this time , we need to bind artificial intelligence and people together because we want to provide humane services .
which is difficult for the indifferent artificial intelligence .
well , to sum up , we can see that data and algorithms can improve our travel experience and make our journey happier .
of course , because the whole traveling scene is very complex and there is so much fun .
in fact , although the application of data and artificial intelligence has been developing for a long time .
what we do is still the tip of an iceberg , and it &apos;s just the beginning .
in the future , we can do much more with more data and algorithms to improve our travel experience .
but owning data also means that we hold a lot of rights and responsibilities .
so how to innovate with restraint and how to make artificial intelligence full of humanity is what we all have to think about .
thank you .
hello , everyone !
I am the artistic director of the TA@@ O Dance The@@ ater .
it &apos;s April 29th today , the World Dance Day .
so my speech today is very meaningful and suitable for this occasion .
first I &apos;d like to thank Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u Talk for giving me such an opportunity to share my views about dance .
I am a dancer .
so I may be much better at expressing my ideas with my body and movements .
so please forgive me if I stumble over my speech or feel ill at ease .
to make myself feel more relaxed and comfortable , I will sit on the ground for the rest of my speech and bring all of you to the world of dance .
the Tao Dance The@@ ater is a full @-@ time contemporary dance group .
it was co @-@ founded by me , D@@ uan Ni and Wang Hao in Beijing in 2008 .
and this year marks the 10th anniversary of the company .
during the past decade , we have performed at hundreds of art festivals in more than forty countries .
we have also developed a systematic set of body training and dance practice .
that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about today : dance , body , and movement research .
it sounds like it doesn &apos;t have much to do with dance .
dance is a primitive form of art , so some people call it the mother of art .
that may be a little bit exaggerated .
but my previous understanding of dance tells me it lives well up to that honor , because it involves the body .
from my perspective , dance is an art industry with no short@@ cuts .
it draws on the body and its movements to communicate , accumulate and convey the pu@@ rest message .
well , the body is actually a concept in pan @-@ art .
the body , combined with any carrier , will convey ideas .
for example , the body can be a script , or a museum .
the body is also the origin of our life , that is , the carrier of our life .
so dance with our body is the expression of time and also of vitality .
but the more important thing is the connection between dance and the body .
dance connects me with the stage , and connects you and me .
every movement of the dancer communic@@ ates the vitality of life .
many of you may find contemporary dance hard to understand .
it is so abstract that you don &apos;t know what the dancers are trying to convey .
to be honest , I feel equally puzzled when I watch some of the dances .
but I wouldn &apos;t say I would try to &quot; understand &quot; what the dances want to express .
because to me , dance is a vocabulary , not a language .
it contains both visual and auditory vocabulary .
and the integration of the voc@@ abul@@ aries on the scene forms an expression of vocabulary .
so when audience say &quot; I don &apos;t understand your work . &quot;
I would normally responding by asking them to see the changes of light instead .
and the color of the costumes .
and the music .
or try to feel how the work brings you to a different field or just feel it , for your feeling is paramount .
if all this doesn &apos;t work and you are sleepy .
you can just grab some sleep , lying comfortably on the seat , and continue watching when you wake up .
well , this is how I usually communicate with my audience .
because I think it is the feelings that make it possible to build a space where people could communicate smoothly with each other .
whether you understand dance or not .
what I want to share today is not only the beauty of dance and the power of the body , but more importantly , the reality of movements .
actually , movement research is a direction we have long been exploring .
one interesting thing about the body is that the flesh has limits , we have only two arms and two legs .
but in dancing , the movements of the body can be so diverse .
this is fascinating !
the movements can be totally different .
but even with the same movement or the same order , different dancers can create a different world .
so I feel the study of the body brings me back to the pu@@ rest way of expression .
one area we have been exploring is the extent to which the plas@@ ticity , mobility , and physical limits of the body can be developed .
well , now I &apos;ll move to the main topic today .
this is going to be very , very informative but it may seem different from the usual dance .
but I want to try it today .
let &apos;s get down to our business .
body , substance , space , gravity , throwing force and weight .
first , let us consider body as substance .
this may seem to be a self @-@ evident topic to you , isn &apos;t it ?
we are the product of the fusion of substances .
the body is life itself , and it is also an origin of our life .
of course , life is a substance by which we can communicate with each other .
there is another concept about dance that I wanted to mention previously but forgot to .
for dancing , it is &quot; I move , therefore I am . &quot;
rather than &quot; I think , therefore I am . &quot;
Su@@ stances are expressed through movements whose existence is worth exploring .
the second point is about space and gravity .
well , we live in a world with gravity .
the world has a magnetic field and our body either confron@@ ts or reconc@@ iles with this magnetic field .
and the planet , and anything else is influenced by gravity .
including natural laws , the formation of four seasons , and many other physical effects .
the throwing force is equal to the weight of the object being thrown .
this means our movement is also a process of working against the gravity .
to make a vivid metaphor , the process is just like when you are throwing out an object .
the distance the object travels and the force on it when it falls is in proportion to the force you exert .
therefore , every movement we make is an act of throwing .
whether you &apos;re walking or squ@@ at@@ ting , you &apos;re making a transition of power , throwing you@@ self out , and bringing yourself back the next moment .
well , what I have shared so far seems like a physics class .
well , it is .
but this is going to be a very interesting physics class .
now , I want to invite a dancer from our theater to come on stage .
she will stand by my side and give a demonstration of how we communicate with the body .
well , please welcome our dancer !
I &apos;d like to start with how we stand .
the space we &apos;ve just mentioned is consciously structured by our consciousness in the process of standing .
there &apos;s a lot of consciousness involved in our standing .
start with the support .
the sol@@ es support our ank@@ les .
our ank@@ les support our knees .
the knees support our hip bones .
the hip bones support our side ribs .
side ribs support our shoulders .
the cervical verte@@ bra supports our head .
all the way down from the head , the neck , the shoulder , the side rib , the hip , the knee , the ank@@ les to the sol@@ es .
this is the supporting mechanics of our body .
but the body is not dead .
it is animate .
so the mechanics of the body are the most animate building , because it is changeable .
when we stand , we mentally divide the space into many parts .
first we may feel that there is a mirror in front of us .
a mirror behind us .
and a mirror on the left and the right .
a mirror over our head .
a mirror in the middle .
a mirror on the ground .
in the area where she is standing , she has mentally formed a space of countless points , lines and planes .
the interesting thing is the oblique mirror .
an oblique mirror in the front .
an oblique mirror in the back .
oblique mirrors on the left and the right .
her sense of space is broadened to more dimensions .
in this area , the mirror we face will undergo constant refr@@ actions .
from the front , to the back , the left , the right , the up , the down , and the center .
her shoulders are relaxed .
her back is stretched from the hair to the ca@@ ud@@ al verte@@ bra .
she breath@@ es in and out as she open her eyes .
the ear and the shoulder blade are unfolded .
every moment she stands , she communic@@ ates through her breath .
this is her sense of time .
she feels her body continually sinking down , heavier and deeper down towards the ground .
the support itself helps her to feel the weight of standing .
the standing position is a scientific posture discovered by the scientists who removed the flesh and muscles from the human body and found the ideal position .
her heels are in the same vertical plane as the is@@ chi@@ um .
her sides form two straight lines .
she squ@@ ats slightly and b@@ ends her knees , with the tip of the knee pointing to the direction of the middle finger .
so as to protect the men@@ isc@@ us .
in fact , when we move , it is less likely to hurt our body by squ@@ at@@ ting with our knees bending forwards than bending in@@ wards .
OK , let &apos;s move to the side part .
after the support , we &apos;ll talk about weigh@@ tl@@ essness .
this is an interesting part .
suppose a point supports all the weight and it suddenly goes out of balance .
what kind of physical phenomenon will happen then ?
as you can see , her whole body will collapse and sink deep .
but there will be a linear clue , which goes all the way from the knee to the ca@@ ud@@ al verte@@ bra to the top of the head , passed down one by one .
what if the knees become weigh@@ tless ?
do you notice that ?
the push I gave her leads to the collapse of the entire body , and the weight falls gradually to the ground .
and what if the whole body experiences weigh@@ tl@@ essness and falls down straight like a chop@@ stick ?
she will draw on the inertia of the next moment to regain her balance .
what if she falls at an angle ?
you may think she hurts a lot when her falls , but this is not the case .
as the body falls , the force is transmitted from one part to the other , forming a linear connection , and it is offset in the process .
this is the s@@ with between support and gravity loss in the study of weigh@@ tl@@ essness .
the next thing is the rebound .
what if the dancer draws on the push to pull herself back up ?
that is to come back with a force .
the body , just like a ball , is elastic .
when I throw it out , it falls on the ground and boun@@ ces back .
then there &apos;s the inertia , the inertia of a force .
drawing on the inertia , the body pulls itself up .
it takes advantage of the inertia in the process .
there &apos;s the inertia in the process .
which is the continuous process of passing the force from one part to another .
just look how the inertia is produced by reb@@ ounding , connecting , and weigh@@ tl@@ essness .
it &apos;s done .
there &apos;s a lot of weigh@@ tl@@ essness in the process .
in the transformation from being supported to weigh@@ tl@@ essness .
she perc@@ ei@@ ves the interaction between her body , the force and gravity .
a daily routine in our rehearsal hall is to discover the mechanics potentials of our physical body .
we connect our movements to form a circle .
the circle forms a non @-@ stop cycle , a connection of the support , the weigh@@ tl@@ essness , the rebound , and the inertia .
this is an endless process of re@@ modeling and transforming .
let &apos;s look at the entire process .
she stands on the ground , pull up , falls to the ground , hangs in the air , and boun@@ ces back , and after many connections she forms a circle .
well , she can keep dancing , as long as she has the strength .
she can keep looking for the inertia and her sense of coordination , she keeps sensing the space with her body .
she dances into one circle after another .
and this brings us to a more difficult movement associated with lying .
OK , let &apos;s talk about lying now .
while standing puts the pressure on the feet .
lying draws on the support of the whole body .
her shoulders , elbows , and hands are here to support the head , and her entire body spreads out like a piece of paper on the ground .
every tor@@ so , joint , hip bone , side rib , and the spine , the head , and even her fingers can feel the weight of her entire body .
as she breath@@ es , she will consciously move the weight to the lower part of her body .
and feel the weight exerted on the tor@@ so of the body and the ground .
so once the body touches the ground , the space will become more diverse .
it &apos;s the support of the entire body .
if the body is supported by four points , the support will be rather stable in the process .
what if it is supported by three points ?
to keep the balance on the ground , there must be at least three force bearing points .
the body will lose gravity if there are only two points .
in that case , there will be a rebound .
the body reb@@ ounds , and falls to the ground .
and with the inertia of the rebound , it falls to the ground , and reb@@ ounds again .
all her strength is controlled by an invisible line .
standing back on the ground is more a result of the rebound .
but lying on the ground keeps your body closer to the ground and the magnetic field itself .
and makes the support points more diverse .
it is three @-@ dimensional , and though constantly repetition , becomes four @-@ dimensional .
this way , we can feel every moment and every body part .
let &apos;s return to the topic of ground .
let &apos;s take a look at the coherent movements on the ground .
draw a circle , repeat the cycle , experience weigh@@ tl@@ essness , fall and rebound , and pull herself to stand , and fall to the ground .
the last thing I want to talk about is spinning .
we can see the previous movement involves a lot of spin which is one of the most valuable movements .
in the training of our early works .
we found through our study on walking and on center of gravity , that there involves the turning in the process .
our ank@@ les , heels , sol@@ es , and toes all move in a circle on the ground and keeping turning .
and turning seems to be the ultimate and the most mysterious secret of all living things .
the flowers also spin , the world sp@@ ins and our thoughts are spinning between us .
just like a whirl@@ pool , the turning produces energy and brings us together .
you can enjoy a whole set of turning by our dancer .
and in the process , we can perceive the relationship between the multidimensional space , the internal vision , external vision , and suspension .
OK , it &apos;s finished .
excellent !
OK , my sincere thanks to the dancer .
the performance brings us to the topic of internal vision , external vision , and multidimensional space .
we have a term called the &quot; Golden E@@ yes . &quot;
that is , when the dancer turns , he or she can &apos;t see anything but glittering flashes like on a roller coaster .
so the dancer must be very clear about her standpoint during her turning .
and about the point she need to focus on next .
all this must be determined when the dancer turns to the right or to left , or forward .
as she turns and loses balance , her body is like in a space in universe , without support and hanging .
and all the space will become her center of gravity .
so this is the process of forming a circle from the sp@@ ins which we have been looking for .
this requires the dancer &apos;s body to be fully developed .
the dancer has to go through constant training and practice to find a linearity of imbalance , inertia , connection , transformation and rebound .
and the practice of turning helps to develop the &quot; circular movement system . &quot;
this marks one stage of our ten @-@ year development .
the circle means the source of life and our body itself .
it &apos;s also the starting point .
that is , every movement you make will motive you to throw a question .
what &apos;s next if I make this move ?
this is a question .
and next how can I answer the question ?
it is answering the question .
so this is a constant process of asking questions and providing answers .
find an answer , and throw a question , and then find an answer before moving to the next question . it is a cycle .
and how do you move in this cycle ?
why moving ?
how we move is a process in which meanings are produced and it requires a lot of thinking .
we integrate our imagination , consciousness , rational thinking with our body .
in the development of the circular movement .
I remember that a very famous architect called G@@ aud@@ i said that &quot; The curve lines belong to God . &quot;
let &apos;s get down to our business .
our bodies are full of curves , and our lives are full of curves .
our fore@@ heads , ears , ch@@ ins , noses , lips , and every inch of our body , are all curved , and they all flow .
the curves form a kind of cycle .
every inch of the body can be connected .
and in that process , even your hair is cylinder @-@ like .
and the flowing process creates an eternal movement , the flow of consciousness .
it is important to &quot; draw circles with imaginary pens &quot; when the dancer dances in circles .
Oh , let &apos;s have a quick interaction .
just remain seated and try to communicate with me through your head and shoulders .
imagine we have a pen mounted on top of our head .
just close your eyes and listen to me .
you can now try to draw a circle with the tip of the pen .
it doesn &apos;t have to be a complete circle .
it can be an irregular one .
after that , we can slowly switch to the left ear@@ lobe .
with the ear@@ lobe , we can draw the circle clock @-@ wise and counter@@ clockwise .
then you can try to draw circles with you right shoulder , your arm@@ pits , elbows , w@@ rists , or your ring finger .
all your body parts can be a pen .
it can be your nose or lips .
it can also be your col@@ lar@@ bone , side ribs , or your tail@@ bone , knees , and even your toes .
so far , I can draw circles with four invisible pens .
I have the four invisible pens which grow out of my body and draw different circles .
elbows and back of the ear with the toes and w@@ rists , or with the back of the head and knees .
isn &apos;t it interesting ?
there are endless combinations that expand your scope of imagination .
this imagination can help you develop your consciousness and body .
every time the movements are different but you can still store some of them in the memory .
and then you try to look for the lost part , think about it , and then transform it by creating an infinite circle .
the infinite circle .
that infinity comes from the support of our spine .
the spine is our axis and it allows us to stand and walk .
what &apos;s more , it seems to best@@ ow dignity on us and equi@@ ps us with the ability to look far away and support ourselves .
but the spine can be further developed in our movements .
because we have a limited vision and listening ability .
we stand facing a flat world .
but with the spinning , twisting , folding , opening and closing of our spine , the space of our body can be developed and twisted .
and our vision is broadened as our body can be folded and turned .
the spine also gives a spatial sense to our hands , feet and hips .
the connection of the spine allows us to produce endless movements across all points , lines , and planes of our body .
like an electro@@ cardi@@ ogram , every part of your body can bend in powerful waves .
it is a romantic but hard to do it .
you have to connect every part of your body .
even with the ground , and even to the point of your entire body is turning on the ground .
the essence of our circular movement system that we &apos;ve being exploring is the peaceful co @-@ existence of all things .
we have the seven senses : eyes , ears , mouth , nose , body , mind , time .
these represent our physical world and our spiritual world .
we have the ability to see , hear , and smell .
from the linguistic expression , breathing , physical touch , to the establishment of our consciousness , imagination , and thinking .
our body finally becomes the time itself and time becomes the expression of the body .
since all things co @-@ exist peacefully , I can see you and you can see me .
you can hear my voice and I can feel your breath .
dance connects all this together .
dance becomes a form of connection that allows dancers to observe themselves and connect with the world .
so next , let &apos;s welcome our dancer Huang Li back to our stage .
she will perform a dance in a circular way .
starting from spinning , then performing on the ground and standing up .
music .
Huang Li is an excellent dancer in our theater and we have worked together for three years .
she also performs in one of the videos I just showed .
well , her body is not a typical woman &apos;s body , rolling over , and seems very and@@ rog@@ yn@@ ous .
we don &apos;t distinguish between women and men in our theater .
in fact , and@@ ro@@ gy@@ ny is the most powerful characteristic .
being and@@ rog@@ yn@@ ous means that one can be both powerful and soft .
this is the plas@@ ticity of the body .
a brief moment is eternal .
dance is the art of pity .
every moment is about to slip sway and can never be recovered , leaving endless p@@ ities and regrets .
so I have been telling dancers not to be obsessed with the moment on stage .
on stage , they are overwhelmed by your attention and applause .
but when the curtain falls , they retreat into loneliness and endless emptiness .
so we have to feel the concentration at every moment , the connection between us , and the relationship between us and the world .
no matter where we perform on stage , we &apos;re not alone .
all co@@ exists .
we will be filled with the consciousness of co @-@ existence .
the integration of different kinds of consciousness becomes a mom@@ entary integrity .
and this integrity gradually grows to be eternal , a disappearing eternity .
the mom@@ entary body movements are the sculpture of the moment .
in the process .
our life is the superficial representation , and it cannot be recovered , so it is finite .
but our life is also infinite in the sense that we will bring back that lost moment at next moment .
it prolifer@@ ates as it slips away .
our energy , our thinking and our possibilities of movements are infinite .
every moment of movement becomes part of your body , and a sculpture .
it is a sculpture of the process .
each moment can be a photo .
and each process or each movement will become a texture .
in making the sculpture , the time un@@ folds itself .
and our body becomes the materi@@ alization and a measure of time .
our body represents time .
we have different speeds in brea@@ ths , heart@@ beats , and stomach squir@@ ming , but that &apos;s the magic of nature .
it ensures a balance of time in the body .
the degree and speed of our movement are an expression of time .
and time is not confined to the clock we see .
it is much more flexible .
because each living body has its own sense of time .
and the process of time becomes a complete expression .
because dance is not a point , a line or a plane .
it is an ongoing and non @-@ stop process .
as long as you &apos;re still alive and the world still exists , your breathing will still be there , and the whole process is the expression of time .
so I often stress that the expression of dance should not focus on a certain moment .
but on the connection , or the process .
in our years of exploration .
I come to feel the ultimate power of passing the bat@@ on of dancing to future generations .
I want to share a little story .
the Tao The@@ ater was co @-@ founded by me , D@@ uan Ni , and Wang Hao .
at the initial stage , only three of us struggled to perform our work on stage .
but as we become older and our body grows weak .
we are gradually drifting away from the stage .
so whenever we see dancers still expressing themselves purely , clearly and attentively on the stage .
the three of us will be moved to tears .
because I feel these emerging artists have played an increasingly important part in performing dance on stage .
it is a kind of spirit , an emotion , a resonance of our spiritual world .
this is a continuation .
and dance is not about individuals .
it is about the relationship between people .
it is about people and life .
because rather than rendering people lonely , dance connects the whole world together .
making people feel the connection with other people , and it allows people to integrate with nature through observations .
loneliness may be the ultimate fear of human beings .
we fear loneliness just as we fear death .
it seems that after death , we will have nothing but the word &quot; lonely . &quot;
dancers incorporate dance into part of their daily life .
they strike a chord with other dancers or people by watching and im@@ itating their dances and by dancing to retain the moment .
our next plan is a nom@@ adic plan that grows out of our long @-@ term performance tour .
this plan follows the lifestyle of the nom@@ ads .
we bring dances and perform them in different cities and spaces in China .
it doesn &apos;t have to be a theater .
it could be a school or any public space .
such as the art gallery , as long as we can communicate like this on the scene .
we can see the sweat , and feel the breath .
we can see or hear it in its most original form .
and let people connect with each other on the spot .
and the connection itself is the benefit of dance .
it can connect the world .
it can also relieve people &apos;s loneliness on the spot .
and then in different scenes , inspire communication between people .
dance is more about retaining the moment than experiencing it .
even if the last second has passed .
we can retain it the next second by constantly repeating the movement to achieve eternity .
that &apos;s all I want to share with you today .
thank you !
I want to invite dancer Huang Li to come on stage and say goodbye to everyone .
I hope you will continue to pay attention to dance .
to the Tao Dance The@@ ater and our nom@@ adic plan .
thank you !
hi , everyone .
I am Chen Sha@@ o@@ qi , a musician from Hong Kong .
I was kind of expecting some applause as encouragement here .
in fact , this is just a little trick of mine .
if I did not get any applause for my speech .
then at least the organizer can edit this at the end of my speech .
the topic I want to share with you today is &quot; the Cre@@ ation of An E@@ ra . &quot;
which is about my experience in the musical industry for the past 32 years .
and some reflections on creation .
it will be divided into four parts .
the first part is the path to creation .
which is about what I have been doing since 1985 , and who I am .
the second part is about some of my other artistic creations , including photography , painting and so on , in addition to music .
the third part is about some of the methods and techniques that I appreciate .
the final part is about slow living and the attitude towards creation .
I will talk about these four parts .
please look at these pictures for a few more seconds .
although I have been in this business for 32 years .
some people still mistake me for a woman when hearing my name .
therefore , please look at these pictures for a few more seconds .
the first part : the road to creation .
I was quite lucky .
in 1984 and 1985 , two of my friends , Liu Y@@ ida and Huang Ya@@ oming , were forming a boy band .
I volunteered to write some lyrics for them .
in the following one or two years .
we recorded many dem@@ os and sent them to different record companies .
soon , the band was chosen and signed by one record company .
the band name was changed to &quot; D@@ aming y@@ i@@ pa@@ i . &quot;
at that time , the compositions , the lyrics , and the M@@ V style of D@@ aming y@@ i@@ pa@@ i .
and the sty@@ ling of the band members were so ahead of the time that they more or less shocked the contemporary music world .
I was also very fortunate , for this reason .
I quickly got the attention from many established singers .
at that time , Alan Tam , Les@@ lie Cheung , An@@ ita Mu@@ i , and Jack@@ y Cheung all invited me to write lyrics for them .
in the following 10 , 15 , or 20 years .
I wrote lyrics for about two or three thousand songs in Hong Kong .
and transformed slowly from a ly@@ ric@@ ist to a producer and plan@@ ner of concerts , songs , and albums .
2005 was a turning point for my career .
at that time , music industry in the mainland just began to take off .
I was invited by many people to do music projects in Beijing and Shanghai
I must confessed that I felt a little upset by the situation at the time .
what situation ?
at that time , I searched the music chart on Baidu Music .
among the top 100 songs , only 8 or 10 songs , probably even less , were Cantonese songs .
sometimes none of songs written by me would appear on the chart for one month , two months , or even half a year .
therefore , I searched for the chart of the top 500 classic songs .
some of my works were on the chart , mostly classic Cantonese songs from the 1980s and 1990s .
this set me to think whether I should make more efforts to get my position in this market .
a market which was completely strange to me ..
at the time , I was 40 years old , an age which seemed too old to start all over again and too young to retire .
however , I did not choose to give up .
in 2006 and 2007 , I opened a studio in Beijing .
I was quite fortunate that I participated in the creation of some public service songs for some large @-@ scale events such as the 2008 Olympic Games and 2010 World Expo .
I was very lucky that in 2008 , Dra@@ wing Heart , the theme song that I created for the film Pain@@ ted S@@ kin .
also received lots of attention and won many prizes .
the next ten years , from 2008 to this year , our studio did many business activities in addition to music production .
some of our business had nothing to do with music .
for example advertising , endorsement , concerts , or the shooting of M@@ V@@ s .
we cooperated extensively with Disney .
including the theme song for the opening ceremony of Shanghai Disneyland , which I produced in collaboration with Mr. Tan D@@ un .
however , in all the music projects , my favorite form of performance is mus@@ icals .
in 1997 , I worked as a screen@@ writer for Jack@@ y Cheung &apos;s musical Snow . wolf . lake and wrote about a quarter of the lyrics and a song for the play .
last year , 20@@ 17 , was the 20th anniversary of Snow . wolf . lake .
I wrote all the lyrics for the musical Feng@@ yun , produced by Ma R@@ ong@@ cheng , a great carto@@ on@@ ist from Hong Kong .
you have probably watched the movie Feng@@ yun .
last year , the production of this musical introduced me to lots of new technologies .
such as stage performance art by using high @-@ tech means like water , fire , video , and new forms of production .
at the end of this year , I am going to produce my first musical , Love in Star@@ light , in collaboration with SM@@ G@@ Live .
in fact , &quot; Star@@ light &quot; is a pu@@ n .
it is the name of a community located in an old lane .
in numerous kinds of musical performances , why do I like mus@@ icals the most ?
the second part of this speech will explain it .
trans @-@ disciplinary art .
it seems I was born with the ability to ret@@ ell a picture or a story with very simple words .
later , at the age of 10 .
I could even turn these words into lyrics .
when I was in junior high school .
I often re@@ wrote some English songs into Chinese songs and wrote lyrics for songs of different themes .
after graduating from high school , I went to a specialized school and ma@@ jo@@ red in graphic design .
so I slowly applied this ability into photography and painting , and later even into 3D models .
that is to say , I enjoy expressing my different life experiences with creative works .
here are some of the photos I took with film cameras .
artists may find it daunting to work with me .
because every time they do a sound recording , a M@@ V , or an advertisement with me .
I will invite them to be my models and take lots of photos of them no matter whether they are willing or reluctant .
which is beyond their proper job description .
you can guess how they feel by the helpless look on their face .
however , they cooperated for most of the time because they know that I really like taking pictures .
there is also painting .
sketch is my favorite form of expression .
these black and white pictures give me a sense of simplicity , sof@@ tness , and emotional calm@@ ness .
the pictures on the top are some my drawing .
I have a habit , if I am on a two@@ - or three @-@ hour flight , I will draw one picture during the flight .
I often draw on the magazines offered on the plane and I would finish the painting within two hours .
however , the picture at the lower left of the screen is a fine dep@@ iction of Li Ji@@ ax@@ in .
a very detailed sketch .
these are detailed sket@@ ches , each of which takes for 100 hours to complete .
I would spend two or three hours a day on these paintings .
after work , I go home and draw for a few hours .
it takes one to two months , or even half a year to complete such a painting .
these tex@@ tures , water , and hairs are drawn stroke by stroke .
this process enables me to talk to myself and gives me more time to plan the overall picture .
this is because arts work in a similar way .
many people have asked me in what ways different arts are similar .
next is the third part of the speech .
some of my frequently adopted means or techniques of creation .
some of the techniques that I use frequently are &quot; unbalanced , &quot; &quot; asym@@ metrical , &quot; &quot; contrast , &quot; and &quot; sub@@ lim@@ ation . &quot;
the first technique is a simple one .
which refers to an unbalanced or asym@@ metrical visual design , in terms of the size or the position of objects .
take the picture on the upper right of the screen as an example .
a cycl@@ ist is facing several thousands of passers @-@ by .
the asym@@ metry and imbalance of the layout .
another technique is &quot; contrast , &quot; the contrast of color .
the picture on the upper left of the screen is such an example .
the picture on the right of the screen is another example .
in this picture , Liang Yong@@ qi is depicted in both black and white .
there is also color contrast in the sketch on the lower left of the screen .
I would also like to mention that there is a slogan on the soda can , which was created by me .
it may difficult for you to see it .
it reads , &quot; love our earth like it &apos;s your heart . &quot;
let us look at the word &quot; earth . &quot;
if you move the last letter &quot; H &quot; to the front , it will read &quot; heart . &quot;
this is the slogan of my own creation .
another technique is sub@@ lim@@ ation .
many people say that art is a sub@@ lim@@ ation of life .
what is sub@@ lim@@ ation ?
an important question that need to be asked here is whether you have the ability to see something extraordinary from something ordinary and common .
because I am very fond of modifying models .
re@@ modeling something originally ordinary into something extraordinary .
for example , I find the shape of Pol@@ ar@@ oid very interesting and I would imagine how to change it into something different .
therefore , I bought one , took it apart , re@@ painted it , turned it into the shape of a spaceship , and added some very milit@@ arized parts to it .
then , I edited the picture and turned it into something like a poster .
the most important thing is that , after all the alteration , it can still take pictures .
it is still a normal Pol@@ ar@@ oid .
this is also a kind of inspiration from life , a kind of sub@@ lim@@ ation .
here is a picture of a draft that I made before .
I spent lots of time designing this draft .
I have collected some parts and some models , but I have not had time to do it .
I have always wanted to convert a mini car into a helicopter .
I have a friend , who is a parent .
he asked me one day .
&quot; Sha@@ o@@ qi , you have so much interest and creations .
in your view , how can I help my child to develop some liter@@ acies or interests that takes dedication ?
then I asked him a question .
I asked him whether he had encouraged his child to do something , some tasks or works , that take one month , half a year , or more than one year to complete in addition to buying the child the latest mobile phone , computer , or notebook .
he looked at me with surprise and said no .
therefore , I asked him to do it right away .
in a new era of new media and high technology .
if you want your child to stay competitive and stand out .
you should train him to do some works and tasks that take a long time to complete besides giving him a mobile phone and a notebook .
because there are fewer and fewer people who have such a capability .
this is the first kind of sub@@ lim@@ ation in art that I told him .
next is about the second kind of sub@@ lim@@ ation .
nowadays there is too much information .
we have access to tons of information , good or bad , relevant or irrelevant , every time we log on We@@ Chat and Wei@@ bo .
therefore , my advice to him is to try to improve his judgment ability and aesthetic standards .
what did I mean ?
that is to say , we should spend less time in criticizing some bad things and judging some people we do not know .
on the contrary , we should spend more time in appreciating what we feel good and viewing the good works .
this will make our own aesthetics standards more pure .
the last point I want to share is to be diligent and to slow down life .
there is a very popular phrase called &quot; slow living . &quot;
many people mistake it as a very laid @-@ back life .
they think sitting in a coffee shop for three hours is slow living , but it is not in my definition .
a slow living life can be also a diligent one .
you have just saw lots of works that I have done .
I have created many works .
pardon me if it sounds like I am br@@ agging , I work hard even when I am enjoying a leisure activity .
because you cannot just waste hundreds of hours doing a painting or making a model .
this is not about making money .
I want to mention that in Hong Kong &apos;s golden age of music .
most artists and compos@@ ers were hardworking too , including the late Les@@ lie Cheung and An@@ ita Mei .
I will not elaborate on it today .
because you probably have heard their stories .
for example , An@@ ita Mei used to work in an amusement park .
at the age of seven or eight , she had to practice singing and dancing every day .
that is why she can become a queen on the stage .
this is my understanding of slow living .
to show the imbalance and asym@@ metry with my life style in a contrast way .
why ?
I still listen to vinyl records very often until today , although it takes lots of time .
you can have access to thousands of songs or tens of thousands of songs with the music app on your mobile phone .
however , I still enjoy listening to vinyl , although it takes lots of time .
the record has to be fli@@ pped every 15 minutes .
I also love taking pictures with film cameras .
and doing bicycle modification .
now it is very convenient to drive , but I still enjoy re@@ modeling bicycles .
I spend so much time looking for some parts from all around the world on the internet .
it is not expensive , but it takes time .
through this process , I grow attached to all the things that I have .
and more and more connected to them .
in this era of new media , everything becomes outdated in an instant .
everything is easily obtained and forgotten .
therefore , through slow living , I learn to cherish what I can get .
recently I have been very interested into doing models of houses .
I built a railway model at home .
because I want to build a model of a small city in Japan .
it is very time @-@ consuming .
it takes a long time to build a model of a house .
therefore , when I was working with the new generation of artists and singers .
I told them that diligence is necessary if they want to survive in this circle .
in addition to packaging and your public image .
you have to stay diligent if you want to stay popular .
because pop art and pop culture have developed for so many years .
it is very difficult to create something new from scratch , be the new carriers , new compositions or new sty@@ ling .
let alone being legendary , it is hard enough to stay popular .
so if you want to stay popular , hard work is necessary .
as a summary of today &apos;s speech .
I want to tell you the story behind a song .
this song is about Les@@ lie Cheung .
because April is the season to be in memory of Les@@ lie .
in 1990 , Les@@ lie Cheung decided to leave the music industry .
one night , several of us were eating at a restaurant in Central Hong Kong .
he mentioned that he had an idea and wanted to retreat from the music industry .
then I told him that he established his fame with The Wind Contin@@ ues to B@@ low .
so maybe I could write another song with the theme of &quot; wind . &quot;
a song which would remind his fans of him every time they hear it .
this song is When the Wind B@@ lows A@@ gain .
hello everyone !
actually I am not an advertising queen .
I feel I am just like an advertising maid who has been serving my clients for 27 years .
now I have shifted to the field of investment , but my role as a maid remains .
my work is to help many young startup founders to develop their businesses and fulfill their dreams .
today I feel very glad to stand here and give a speech .
but I won &apos;t speak as an investor or an advertis@@ er .
I &apos;d prefer to speak as a marke@@ ter who has been working in marketing for over 20 years .
I spent 16 years working in China , and that allowed me to take a very close look at how the mobile and social media industries developed in China .
that &apos;s also something I want to share with you today .
breakthroughs and innovations achieved in Chinese mobile and social media industries stunned the entire world .
prior to those two things , the major breakthroughs and innovations .
China was only known by the world as a copy@@ cat .
but the progress made in the two industries brought home to the world that China had actually long ceased being a copy@@ cat .
today my focus is also on those breakthroughs and innovations achieved in Chinese mobile and social media industries .
they were boosted by several factors , such as technological innovation .
but I believe there are three important things in social development and change that have either directly or indirectly led to the brilliant turning points in the mobile and social media industries .
my speech today will revol@@ ve mainly around those three social changes .
namely the one @-@ child policy , railway infrastructure investment and the new wealthy .
you might have doubts , but the truth is that those three social changes contributed a lot to the progress made in Chinese mobile and social media industries .
I &apos;ll talk about them one by one .
firstly , the one @-@ child policy .
you must know that currently the one @-@ child policy has been replaced by a universal two @-@ child policy .
which was only introduced last year .
but before that , for over 30 to 40 years altogether , China had never loos@@ ened its grip on the one @-@ child policy .
accordingly , over half of the 1.4 billion Chinese population grew up as the only child in their family .
raise your hand if you are an only child .
that is a majority .
while hunger marketing is popular in the world , I personally think that there is also a marketing strategy that is peculiar to China : loneliness marketing .
many of us here may find that , when we grew up as the only child in our family , we actually felt very lonely .
haunted by this loneliness , even though we always had some neighbors and classmates to turn to .
we still wished for an extended si@@ bling network , and more friends .
if we lived in Chengdu , we might imagine whether , in the distant Beijing .
there was a peer har@@ boring the same dreams and suffering the same growing pain as we did .
so when social media was born .
the one @-@ child generation in China hailed it as a god@@ send .
how do we know that ?
take Q@@ Q , the first social media tool in China , which appeared around 20 years ago .
from its onset , Q@@ Q has been serving as a great platform for the lonely young souls in China to build their extended si@@ bling network .
like I just said , if I lived in Chengdu and someone from the distant Beijing just reacted to whatever happened in my life .
even if it was merely a breakfast posted on line .
then I would gain from that a kind of grati@@ fication and faith that people around me .
like my parents and grandparents , would rarely understand .
so it took Q@@ Q only two years to hit 100 million users .
a dozen years after that , T@@ enc@@ ent , the owner of Q@@ Q .
launched another social media tool which was to devour still more of our time every day : We@@ Chat .
We@@ Chat proved an even quicker market conqu@@ er@@ or .
it used only one year to hit 100 million users .
do you know how long did Facebook , an earlier social media platform than We@@ Chat , use to achieve that goal ?
as a huge and global network , Facebook spent up to four years in gar@@ n@@ ering 100 million users .
it &apos;s actually very important for Chinese young people to find a platform where they could express and show themselves .
find similar peers and establish a network of friends that go far beyond their family members and relatives .
let me ask you a question , suppose you are a brand , or a marketing agency .
how do you plan to apply loneliness marketing on the 700 million Chinese people then ?
you might still remember this popular little game rolled out ahead of last Chinese New Year ,
named &quot; 20@@ 18 Year of the Dog family portrait . &quot; it instantly became a We@@ Chat hit .
you can see that it was a very simple H@@ 5 game .
but do you know anything about its background ?
the primary idea behind this H@@ 5 game was that the designers wished that a child could grow up accompanied by a pet .
since 20@@ 18 was the year of dog , the pet had better be a dog , who is always a loyal friend to human beings .
it was hoped that the pet would accompany the only child along the way as he or she was growing up .
the loneliness of the only children was embedded in the design .
here is another video , which you might also have watched around last Chinese New Year .
it takes a little time to watch this video .
but the reason I insisted that you watch it from beginning to end is that there is very strong emotion here .
the only child &apos;s longing for time with his mother .
and of course there are also other implications .
such as the fate of the left @-@ behind children .
when it was posted online around last Chinese New Year .
the video got a considerable number of views .
viewers were so moved that a huge portion of them left their comments .
this video is an ad of Apple .
shot with an iPhone 10 from beginning to end by Chen K@@ ex@@ in , it was used as a publicity stunt .
but it sub@@ tly utilized the emotions of the only child .
or the single child , and that made it a big success .
so for Apple , the truth is , a good show of its products might not always be necessary in its marketing .
an exploration into the feelings of people might work better , if it wants to reach to the Chinese consumers .
the second thing is the social development .
for decades , the Chinese government has been pressing ahead with the infrastructure construction .
chief among the infrastructure construction programs is the railway construction .
those who live in Shanghai or Beijing may take railway for granted .
as of the end of last year , the length of railways in China totaled 12@@ 8,@@ 000@@ km .
17 percent of the length belonged to the high @-@ speed rail .
Chinese railway has witnessed progress from the improved speed of CR@@ H D trains to the roll @-@ out of CR@@ H G trains .
but what do the spe@@ edi@@ er trains have to do with the mobile development then ?
the spe@@ edi@@ er trains bring cities closer to each other .
whereby mobile users , consumers and people with business trip plans are more willing to travel by railway to another city or another far@@ away place .
for the travel distance now seems to be largely shortened by the railway construction .
here I want to show you some figures .
last year alone , the commercial passenger volume for Chinese rail achieved about three billion .
that means , every Chinese took three train trips on average .
during the Chinese New Year travel rush last year , the passenger volume grew by 10 % compared with the year before .
meanwhile , the entire population didn &apos;t increase that much .
so we can see that trains are becoming an increasingly popular means of transportation .
as you have more frequent business travels and are , especially if you are a Chinese , always on the road for business .
the only thing that makes you stay connected with the world , your family , friends and clients might be your mobile devices .
this is a chart of the fastest high @-@ speed trains in the world .
and we can see that the top two trains are both from China .
the first one is the Shanghai Mag@@ le@@ v Tr@@ ain , but I personally think it is more of a show case .
for it only travels within the Pudong District - and it even never crosses the Huang@@ pu River .
the second one is the harmony CR@@ H train .
which we all know is the world &apos;s fastest .
like I just said , as we spend more time on road .
we become more dependent on the mobile services .
let &apos;s take a look at this chart .
the blue columns display the mobile usage in China for the past seven years .
the red columns are for fixed @-@ line usage , namely the usage of the telephones we install in our house .
the purple column indicates the mobile usage via 4@@ G , which didn &apos;t come until 20@@ 16 .
as you can see or have already experienced , China just skipped fixed @-@ line and rushed towards a mobile economy .
thus mobile usage now far exceeds the fixed @-@ line usage in China .
but we don &apos;t just use mobile devices to stay connected with family members and friends .
though we have the largest number of smart@@ phone users .
thanks to our huge population .
we are also leading the world in mobile payment .
while the global average share is about 33 percent .
in China over a half of the mobile users depend on mobile payment for most of their transactions .
besides mobile payment , I guess there are also other things you might care about , for example , health .
important questions linking to health , such as how many steps you walk or run every day , and what you eat , can also be tracked by mobile services .
here is a very interesting video for you , which shows how dependent we are on and how enthusiastic we are about mobile services .
I &apos;ve concluded that , during the last month .
the only occasion when I couldn &apos;t use mobile payment was when I was buying won@@ tons from a small street food stall in front of my office .
I lined up there and waited for a long time , only to be reminded in the end that , quite contrary to what I thought , mobile payment was not accepted there .
finally I had to give up those won@@ tons .
because I didn &apos;t have any cash on me .
of course this video is specially aimed at foreigners and tries to convey to them how far mobile payment has gone in China .
as you might have seen earlier , actually 45 % of the mobile internet users now in China already take mobile payment as their No.1 payment choice .
so if you are a brand and want to sell your products to consumers .
you must be very careful about where you place your mobile payment service and whether consumers can easily handle it .
if a consumer can &apos;t finish his payment within three steps , then you will definitely lose him .
never give too many fancy choices to the consumers .
just make sure that they can finish their payment within three steps , or else they will shift to somewhere else .
the third important social change in China is the rising of the new wealthy , a somehow controversial group of people .
these new wealthy people who get rich quick are eager to announce to the world , &quot; I made it .
look how successful and rich I am ! &quot;
the combination of mobile internet and social media gives them a perfect stage to f@@ laun@@ t their wealth .
so far the number of million@@ aires in China has surpassed 1.3 million .
the number of the ultra high net worth individuals in China .
such as Ma Yun and P@@ ony Ma , ranks the third all over the world .
Europe the continent ranks the second .
so actually if we calculate by single country , China should only be second to US .
in this context , it becomes common for new wealthy people , whatever their age , to show off their wealth on social media , just like this man here .
I guess this photo must be taken before he went into prison .
but I &apos;m also not so sure .
and here is another photo . do you remember her ?
Guo Me@@ im@@ ei .
she should be serving her sentence in prison right now .
some young new wealthy people , after they get married and have children .
even go so far as to involve their children in their showing off .
with social media and convenient mobile devices at hand .
especially with the addition of a camera , the act of showing oneself is largely facilitated .
and those show@@ y new wealthy people are also drawing crowds to the mobile and social @-@ networking platforms .
because human beings are just so easily attracted by dramatic scenes .
for example , the recently tren@@ ding app Dou@@ yin .
as I see it , is bringing showing off into a pin@@ nacle moment .
people are not only showing off themselves but also their pets .
do you know that actually video platforms like Dou@@ yin aren &apos;t new at all ?
about eleven to twelve years ago .
when You@@ ku was newly launched , online TV was pre@@ dominated by long videos , especially TV programs .
later , during the last five to six years , however , cell phones , or mobile terminals , began to feature increasingly advanced video playing technologies .
the function was better and the definition was higher .
that made filming a lot easier for consumers and UGC suddenly came into sight .
but what &apos;s the thing about Dou@@ yin that makes things even more convenient ?
it largely stream@@ lines the work of adding a sound@@ track to a video . to do that , Dou@@ yin users now only have to click a button on the cell phone .
sound@@ track editing is no longer necessary .
with some background music accompanying them , the videos now look more lively .
though Dou@@ yin still has to leverage traffic from Jin@@ ri Tou@@ ti@@ ao , a news and information content platform .
it has to be admitted that the flourishing of platforms like Dou@@ yin marks the beginning of an age where UGC should pre@@ dominate .
I guess many brands are possibly planning to post a pro@@ mo video on Dou@@ yin .
remember the first step is always to shift your perspective and think from the standpoint of the users .
what kind of video will be loved by them ?
believe me , if you shoot a video just through the lens of an advertis@@ er or a brand owner , your video will look no more than an ad .
it is not the kind UGC would want .
Dou@@ yin is a UGC platform , and you must make your video in a UGC style .
like I just said , the mobile development and the booming social media in China have reversed the world &apos;s opinion about China .
now China is even attracting pilgri@@ ms from abroad who want to learn .
the video I showed you earlier mentioned the &quot; Four Great In@@ ven@@ tions of modern China . &quot;
namely the shared bicycles , high speed rail , E @-@ commerce and mobile payment .
three of them are related with mobile development .
that is also a thing that seems unbelievable for many other countries .
so , with innumerable breakthroughs and achievements .
China is actually taking the lead in the world in mobile and social media development .
now I &apos;d like to end my speech with a video .
besides the mobile and social media industry , there are actually many other fields .
even though we can &apos;t tell their name .
where China exc@@ els and is striving for &quot; glorious achievements . &quot;
the next video will reveal exactly in what fields China will lead the world .
OK , here it begins .
if you are a regular guest in Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u .
you might be able to meet a lot of pioneers in those cutting @-@ edge technologies who give speeches about all kinds of innovations achieved in their field .
thank you for your time today .
and I wish my speech would be of some help to you .
thank you !
good morning , everyone .
the theme of my speech today is &quot; Technology re@@ shapes Finance . &quot;
first , I &apos;d like to talk about how technology has re@@ shaped the talent pool .
I have been flying to Silicon Valley monthly for the first half of this year .
every time , I could feel that more and more high @-@ caliber talents , ranging from MIT , Stanford and Harvard graduates to people work at top @-@ notch firms like Facebook and Google , are starting to d@@ ab@@ ble into the field of financial technology , launching their own AI and block@@ chain @-@ related projects .
I want to tell you a story from my personal experience .
when I first founded di@@ an@@ r@@ ong@@ .com five years ago , I offered a young man in his early tw@@ enties a position at my new P@@ 2@@ P lending start @-@ up .
being out@@ stand@@ ingly good at his job in the bank , he turned down my proposition .
after five years , with the success of di@@ an@@ r@@ ong@@ .com and the popularization of financial technologies , the young man decided to join my newly @-@ established block@@ chain start @-@ up after weighing out his options in the past month .
this phenomenon is common in the banking sector .
another trend we have observed is that first @-@ rate experts from traditional industries are f@@ locking to the field of financial technology .
this was a photo of Zhang Sh@@ ou@@ cheng , a ten@@ ured professor of astro@@ physics at Stanford University , who had been regarded as the &quot; Chinese that came the closest to getting a Nobel prize . &quot;
however , in the last year or so , he announced to the public that D@@ H@@ VC ( Dan@@ hua Capital ) led by himself , has been prof@@ iting tremendously from investing in a couple of block@@ chain projects .
he made some bold asser@@ tions , such as he believed that all reliable mechanisms should be based on mathematics , and that all efficiency gained and cost reduced that couldn &apos;t be explained by energy consumption was not credible .
Zhang gave new conno@@ tations to financial technology from the perspective of a physicist , and some of his conclusions happened to coincide with my observations .
the collapse of trust after 2008 has been the catalyst for a new round of development in financial technologies .
in the eyes of the public , after the financial crisis in 2008 , experts , banks and even the government are un@@ trustworthy , especially when they have kept you in the dark about the currency over @-@ issue .
when a group of ge@@ eks concep@@ tu@@ alized a brand new trust mechanism based on block@@ chain , people found mathematics and crypto@@ graphic algorithm are the most dependable , as we can establish direct trust connection between strangers on the Internet to complete the transaction of value .
apart from talents , now we turn our eyes to see how block@@ chain has re@@ shaped capitals .
Tim Dr@@ aper , whose family is known for venture capital for four generations , has been earning astronomical amounts of profits from his investments in tech giants such as Sk@@ ype , Microsoft and Google .
the D@@ rap@@ ers recently revealed that they had invested heavily on crypto@@ currency and artificial intelligence .
during a public speech , they dar@@ ingly predicted that the bit@@ coin price would surge from its current 8,000 USD to a wh@@ op@@ ping 250,000 USD by 20@@ 22 .
in terms of virtual and digital currencies , bit@@ coin &apos;s market value has sky@@ roc@@ keted from 10 billion USD to a staggering 145 billion USD in just two years .
Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ cur@@ r@@ cy has created more than 400 billion USD in wealth , with a steady stream of old money being poured into the market .
in the field of financial technology , we can proudly say that China is ahead of the world .
the total amount of third @-@ party payment made in China is already 50 times that of the United States in 20@@ 16 .
in addition , China &apos;s online payment amount has reached 5.5 trillion USD , way surpassed the United States &apos; 110 billion USD in 20@@ 16 , with the Chinese figure still snow@@ ball@@ ing in 20@@ 17 and 20@@ 18 .
how did our lead in financial technology come about ?
was it because of the context ?
I believe it was due to a lack of legal restr@@ aints .
whether it is Ali@@ pay or We@@ Chat , these third @-@ party payment applications gather a lot of the users &apos; digital footprints unrelated to their financial activities .
We@@ Chat and Ali@@ pay collect information such as social media data and transaction records for the analysis of users &apos; financial attributes .
why does An@@ t Financial Service Group ( An@@ t Financial ) now value at 100 billion USD , when its previous estimate was at 60 billion USD ?
the reason why an un@@ listed private equity firm can get such an astronomical estimate is that the transaction data we left on Ali@@ pay and Ta@@ obao has given financial attributes to the company .
the situation is not looking any better in the United States .
Facebook founder Mark Z@@ uc@@ ker@@ berg has gone through 10 hours of congressional questioning during the first half of this year , over allegations that Cambridge Analy@@ tica had harvested the personal data of 27@@ 0,000 people &apos;s Facebook profiles without their consent and ultimately gained access to data of 50 million Facebook users .
the ill@@ icitly @-@ harvested personal data were used to help Donald Tr@@ ump win the presidential election .
when we accept the service agreement on Ali@@ pay , there is an option that is easy to be neglected if we don &apos;t pay attention .
that is giving our consents to Ali@@ pay to have our data collected and authorized to third @-@ party organizations .
this means that we give Ali@@ pay , An@@ t Finance and Z@@ hima Credit the grant to collect our information that they could get from all third @-@ party organizations and to set up our personal credit profiles .
it is difficult for the average consumers and Internet users to take notice of a single clause buried in a lengthy and complicated service agreement .
five billion customer information has been leaked at J@@ D@@ .com .
C@@ trip and D@@ idi Chu@@ xing have also exploited their data monopoly to increase the service prices unilaterally .
similar situations can be found everywhere in the age of the Internet .
the Internet was invented to promote the value of equality , freedom and sharing , but today , digital monopoly is far more intense than the monopoly we had in the traditional industrial era .
I hope that the development of financial technologies can change the status quo .
we might have our concerns , but we shall have faith .
every new technology has its bubble at an early stage , which is a necessary means to attract public attention .
in the past few years , many people have been grav@@ itating towards the innovative P@@ 2@@ P business mode and crypto@@ currency IC@@ O , mainly for the tremendous prof@@ iting potential .
ordinary folks are low in capital .
they may have only 10,000 yuan for some smart investments with a single @-@ digit percentage interest rate , through which , they can earn some extra bucks for daily spending .
it is impossible for them to elevate their social class with small amount capitals ; therefore , large @-@ scale wealth management is still a privilege of the rich and powerful .
how can the rising up@@ start class move up the social ladder ?
only the wealth effect , that equals to 100 or even 1000 times return on investment , brought by new technologies and opportun@@ ies could make it happen .
if you come for the gold , chances are you will be exploited as well .
an overseas money mo@@ gu@@ l that I know has been exploited and played many times in the currency market , he now has become a currency manipulator himself .
therefore , people who wish to have financial freedom should improve themselves , or else , they would be at a constant disadvantage by relying on the traditional Bet@@ a and Al@@ pha investments and wishing for information symmetry with the high @-@ net @-@ worth individuals .
it is very likely that financial technologies are first exploited by the bad guys .
during the early years of Internet development , the increased Internet speed and the application of new scenarios were motivated by online pornography , gambling and drug sales , with e @-@ commerce , online gaming and Internet finance coming in at later times .
so everyone should be a participant in Internet development , including the advancement of financial technology .
we should learn about the concepts of authentic inclusive finance and Pon@@ zi scheme , while continuously upgrading our knowledge and skills as well as our analytical ability .
so that we could get rid of the disadvant@@ ageous position for the majority in the financial sector .
first and foremost , I think , changes must be made to the ownership of data .
I want to tell you a keyword , which will be very beneficial for you to know , and that word is G@@ D@@ PR .
unfamiliar it might seem , it is the acr@@ onym for EU &apos;s latest General Data Protection Regulation .
simply put , the regulation grants data subjects the right to have their data er@@ ased and the right of data use authorization .
in addition , Internet companies cannot retain private data unconditionally and permanently .
I just want to purchase a cup online , and the website has collected my home address , GPS information , and information like what time I log on the site every day to analyze my credibility and financial status with the data .
in the future , the ownership of data will be shifted from Internet companies to consumer data service providers .
second , a layered authorization mechanism shall be established through block@@ chain .
we can authorize log @-@ in websites to use our data only for e @-@ commerce purposes , and grant P@@ 2@@ P websites or other financial websites or credit card companies the right to use the data of our financial attributes .
in this case , every time we provide data , we can get something in return , instead of having our data being permanently abused by those Internet giants for free once we log on websites .
B@@ lock@@ chain provides us with such a possibility .
its token economy system demands every user to pay for the data we provide , so we become the owner , user and beneficiary of our data assets .
in conclusion , financial technologies have changed our lives in four aspects .
first , it &apos;s the rights .
as I just mentioned , the ownership , right to use and beneficiary of data are all different .
for example , a CD is priced at around 10 USD in America , and a music cassette used to worth a dozen yuan in China .
however , the content cre@@ ators can only get 1.7 USD out of the price customers paid .
in China , the percentage could be even lower , as the musicians might get less than one yuan out of every sell .
however , interest distribution will be different under the business logic of block@@ chain .
the copyright holders will be able to get 90 % of the profit generated through their music and IPR contents .
situations such as Apple taking away 70 % of the profit of the copyright owners , or Chinese firms like Ne@@ tease and We@@ Chat collecting over 50 % of the revenue , would be fundamentally altered .
another great thing about block@@ chain is that it re@@ defines consensus .
in the past , we get to know strangers by asking their fathers &apos; professions , their work and job titles .
through these labels , we will give the other parties an initial score : this individual is wealthy and can be beneficial to me .
such an exchange is unequal after all , as an ordinary individual seldom has the chance to dine at the same table with a billionaire .
in the era of block@@ chain , value conversion adheres to a protocol for inter @-@ node communication under a crypto@@ graphic hash , creating an equal trading ground for people from different backgrounds and economic stat@@ uses .
the establishment of a new consensus mechanism may bring about the real social life we have long been des@@ iring .
last and most importantly , block@@ chain has re@@ invented contractual agreement .
B@@ lock@@ chain @-@ based smart contracts are un@@ bre@@ achable and resistant to modification , once the terms are written into codes .
computer engineers believe in the motto : &quot; code is law . &quot;
in their mind@@ sets , the programming language is the golden rule , and every step is formed by procedural language .
I used to be a lawyer .
I think that the future of the block@@ chain would be &quot; Law is code , &quot; and all the rules will be executed through procedural languages and machine languages .
contractual breaches and the un@@ prov@@ ability will soon be things of the past in the era of financial technology .
a few days ago , a fellow alum@@ n@@ us of mine , who is the director at a notary office , told me that : &quot; do you know that in Shanghai , you have to wait for at least half a year to get your will notar@@ ized ? we need to dispatch personnel to conduct on @-@ site inspections and the notary fee is only 80 yuan per time . our staffs are not motivated to the job , but six months could be a luxury for a lot of the senior te@@ stat@@ ors . &quot;
the credible consensus of the block@@ chain allows us to significantly reduce the cost and improve the efficiency for the beneficiaries and stakeholders through distributing digital records that cannot be altered retro@@ actively .
therefore , the era of block@@ chain has given new dimensions to the contractual spirit and minim@@ ized the cost for trans@@ acti@@ onal friction in a commercial society .
through the promotion of financial technologies , we hope to achieve equality , freedom and sharing in financial services , eliminating the biased , limited and expensive services .
that would be the perfect financial society we wish for the future .
thank you all !
thank you for your applause !
today I &apos;d like to talk about my attitude to my daily life , work and creation .
that is , to take things as they come .
this is a childhood photo of mine .
I show this to you because I &apos;m about to tell a lot about myself .
I think the way a person behaves , the work he undertakes , and even his design philosophy , his artistic views and his own growth are absolutely inseparable from the life he is facing .
this photo was taken when I was very little .
in fact , I am a congenital disabled person .
I was born with a deformity .
uh , my leg was deformed and co@@ iled on my body .
and it was only after more than 20 sur@@ ger@@ ies that I became what I am now .
you can see that my feet , in black socks , are ab@@ normally thick .
actually I just had my surgery completed and had a plaster cast on my foot .
and then my mother took this photo for me .
then , there was a new animation from Japan called Astr@@ o Boy .
my mother always encouraged me by saying I was like the Astr@@ o Boy .
I liked such a heroic figure at that time .
recently , I took out the photo , and I found my legs on plaster are just like Astr@@ o Boy &apos;s . so I also drew a fire @-@ breathing device under my feet .
that &apos;s a natural me .
I was born in this way .
but I never felt depressed about it .
I &apos; ve done many things and various kinds of work .
design .
public artistic creation .
cur@@ ation .
teaching .
personal creation .
many friends worried about me for undertaking too much for my handicapped body .
so I started to intro@@ spect , &quot; Why do I sometimes want to do so many things ? &quot;
why am I so &quot; greedy &quot; ?
later on , I realized , since I lack some things .
I may take the things I can do in my life , my work and my creation to establish an exchange with the public and with everyone .
I &apos;m not able to establish enough communication physically .
I can &apos;t rush to your side and talk to you .
I may not go if it &apos;s a distant place .
but my work is the way I communicate with the world .
so , interaction is a very important word for me .
that word also exists in my creation of public art .
however , the interaction I prefer to convey should be natural .
rather than an interaction produced when the people are instructed to make a specific movement .
so I kept thinking over my works .
I created a work named Tr@@ aces 8 years ago .
it was a desk and a chair .
I only made a set of it , not in batches .
I found on Ta@@ obao an interesting , temperature sensitive material .
so I made it into a furniture work .
it can fade into the color of wood as the temperature of the person who touches it changes .
then it records every touch .
when the person leaves it .
it returns to its original color .
this was a result from my thoughts on how to create a natural exchange or interaction when a person uses the furniture .
this was a result from my thoughts on how to create a natural exchange or interaction when a person uses the furniture .
I &apos;m fond of sl@@ ums .
sl@@ ums may impress you with dirty and messy places , but I perceived intelligence there .
it strikes me that sl@@ ums are a marvelous form of architecture . in spite of the structure and interrelated buildings , a myriad of families live here without disputes and interference .
it &apos;s fairly hard for an architect to reproduce a sl@@ um .
so I was inspired by such a community and created a work , a furniture work .
it &apos;s a cabinet .
different parts of it do not interfere with each other .
every part of a single box can be opened and has its function .
then I got a good opportunity to reproduce a community with such cabinets .
once , I created a public work in downtown .
that &apos;s a combination of containers and my sl@@ um boxes , which is also a community fantasy .
of course , those containers also have their functions .
which include gallery , canteen , caf@@ é , cinema , etc .
then I &apos;d like to show you three pav@@ ili@@ ons I created .
I think when public works of art are put into a public area , people can have direct interaction with them .
so I drew inspiration from the autumn leaves of plane trees in Shanghai and created an art work .
it &apos;s a pavilion , and also a major sculpture .
under which small exhibitions can be held .
under the pavilion , or the leaves , I displayed works of my students , young designers and artists .
besides , I made another pavilion .
it was to celebrate the Year of Sn@@ ake in 20@@ 13 .
through the work , the public could receive the new year &apos;s blessing .
I adopted neon lights , the symbol familiar to people , the form of pavilion and the shape of snake .
the public work is erected on the Nan@@ li S@@ q@@ ure of Shanghai Xin@@ ti@@ and@@ i .
it was welcomed by people .
here are photos showing the lighting effects .
in 20@@ 16 , Shanghai Se@@ ed Project was undertaken in Shanghai .
I worked as a public art researcher and created for children a space at the Century Park of Pudong .
you can see at the left bottom of the screen , the work is like a planet .
during that time , I kept thinking how to make the &quot; planet &quot; more fascinating .
how can I make the public who interact with it curious about the future ?
I actually made some holes on its surface .
so the children came into the pavilion and enjoyed all the settings in there , the inclined structure , all the installations and various relaxing ways .
they may also stick out their heads from small or big holes and see the outside world .
the pavilion has two sides .
in fact , I only made a cloth to separate the world into the present and the future .
it has functions inside .
children may play in it in different ways , and may stick their heads out from different holes .
I also invited many children to create seeds with me .
I chose a lot of seeds painted by them and continued to make creations .
to the last day of the work , the form , symbol and color of the work changed every day .
which made me enjoy it very much and realized why public art was so attractive to me .
because I was like an observer who created such a stage and such a space where all the public would have new performances every day before me .
so to speak , public art works are ever changing .
then I created this work , Hey , human !
I designed a swing for public place .
its original theme is the exciting moment when humans are created .
due to the participation of the public and different ways to play it .
the outcome may be more diversified and fascinating , and a new story formed .
this outcome was unexpected , for I only made a swing .
children had a great fun with it .
then , another version of the swing showed up in the gallery , at the exhibition of Yu D@@ ey@@ ao last year .
its state was a little bit different .
you can see this video .
this is in a mall .
and this is in the gallery .
it &apos;s natural that people in the gallery played with the swing in a different way .
it &apos;s interesting , and I &apos;m ready to accept both states .
as for works made in my teaching process .
these two works were made respectively in San@@ lin ancient town and in Zhu@@ ji@@ a@@ ji@@ ao .
we took the students to exchange old objects with new ones among the local public for re @-@ creation at the scene .
my thought was that the artist plus the public is then equal to a daily performance .
with each party accounting for half .
however , it is also possible that with the change of time , the number of artists will become fewer and fewer in the creation of works .
and finally the artists may not appear at all .
they will hide behind the scenes , and finally the public will account for 100 % .
then the daily performance will be carried out totally by the public .
I enjoy very much the uncertainty , and the performance that the public brings .
well , here is something else I would like to share with you .
some paintings .
you may tell that these paintings are all related to the works I showed you before .
in fact , I started to create these works since April 14th , 2015 .
I painted through my mobile phone every day .
but where did I get the idea to do it ?
once when I was correcting exercises for my students on an AP@@ P , it suddenly occurred to me that I wanted to paint something .
and I found I was also good at it .
I was pleased by the thought of being able to paint every day .
I didn &apos;t even need a studio to do it .
I can do it everywhere , on taxi , at home , at station , at any mall or even in bed .
I felt quite satisfied .
then nothing could hold me back ever since then .
I painted every day , about my daily life .
these were made in 20@@ 16 .
I did it every day .
and it has been almost 3 years .
these are excer@@ pts from 20@@ 17 , and from 20@@ 18 .
every time I completed one , I shared it to my Mom@@ ents .
that actually made a small exhibition of my paintings in my Mom@@ ents .
I received all kinds of comments on them every day , and I enjoyed it .
I never named a single painting and never attached any explanatory words .
but everyone &apos;s interpretation and feedback were different , which was a great delight to me .
my friends often asked me , &quot; what exactly are your works ? &quot;
&quot; are they modern works , new media works , paintings or something else ? &quot;
I replied , &quot; I don &apos;t know .
they are just a kind of creation , and there is no need to classify them .
&quot; how do you collect them ? &quot; some asked .
I said , &quot; I have no idea .
but it &apos;s a pleasure for me to do it every day . &quot;
last year , I had an opportunity to hold a small exhibition .
it was an attempt in a space .
we created a theme of living room in a space .
I selected 12 paintings .
I converted my paintings based on electronic media to a space and produced a lot of contents corresponding to the theme of living room .
I presented 12 different items in my phone , including my portrait , wall calendar , clothing , paintings .
some of them were made into small sculptures .
as a matter of fact , each painting , including my carpet and my legs , is loaded with plenty stories . but since time is limited , I &apos;m not going to detail them .
the painting of legs , as you can see , is made on the basis of my childhood photo I showed you before .
then I created candles with it .
last year when I was in H@@ ok@@ ka@@ ido of Japan .
I made it into a new work by ign@@ iting the candles in the snow@@ field .
at the scene I also had a light work , a balcony work and a work about the scenery outside the window .
I selected 12 different paintings to respond to the space .
the paintings were later printed in a piece of newspaper .
while I continue to create paintings on my mobile phone , I keep thinking over how to utilize them .
and I realize , now that they came from the internet .
I have to return them to the internet .
therefore , I put all my mobile phone paintings on a website .
you may scan the Q@@ R code to see all of the paintings .
when seeing it , perhaps you will feel that you are watching a movie of me .
this is a work I made in Tong@@ ji University .
it &apos;s also quite natural , for it &apos;s shaped as the scenery of a mountain and also has the function of a public bench .
that &apos;s what I always want to present .
that &apos;s a functional art work .
to take things as they come is a theme of great influence on me .
just now , the heavy rain brought rolls of thunder .
but if you regard the thunder as a noise , you may be wrong , for I consider it an applause that nature gave me .
isn &apos;t this intriguing ?
so , to take things as they come is an attitude .
I accept everything , and turn it into my work .
thank you !
most of you are familiar with the voice of me in the broadcast , and now I &apos;m here , in the flesh .
I &apos;d like to say that every man of success is bound to be very diligent and hardworking , just like all the successful people that have come here at Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u Talk .
I feel a bit uneasy about claiming to be successful , but I do believe I &apos;m a hardworking man .
people say the slogan of the Dragon Television is &quot; the power of dream . &quot;
indeed .
but the essence comes after , which is to &quot; be meticulous . &quot;
first , let us interact a bit .
now if you think about it , what you used to play with when you were around the age of 12 or 13 ?
you may tell me loudly .
what did you like to do ?
I assume that boys would play with toy racing cars or do sports like basketball or football .
I was perhaps different , here are the things I used to play with .
these may seem like candles or wh@@ i@@ ps or something else to you .
you are right about the candles , the thing beside is not a whip but a laser pen , then there is a flashlight and some fish wires .
what did I do with all these things ?
I built a stage with them when I was 12 , it is now kept in my house .
you could look at the left corner of the screen , this is a sketch I drew of the stage .
it looks shabby but in my eyes it is luxurious .
it &apos;s a four @-@ sided stage , with six performance areas , and elev@@ ating platforms .
its fabrication was very simple .
some pieces of wood , some glue , and an empty Rob@@ ust milk bottle .
you may find it confusing to see a milk bottle here .
to have the follow@@ spot .
I lit a candle and put it in the bottle , and the light came out as a beam of light .
so a stage was created out of my pure imagination .
a big project from a little boy .
now it &apos;s been over a decade , and I become a real stage director , making my childhood dream come true .
I &apos;ve been acting as the chief director of the after@@ party of the ER@@ C Chinese Top Ten Awards these past few years .
on the left of the screen is the design for this year &apos;s party , with camera placement included .
on the right is the process of building bit by bit in the Mercedes Ben@@ z Center , a luxurious and gorgeous stage , starting from the light stands and performance platforms to a final stage .
over the past 25 years , the ER@@ C Chinese Top Ten Awards has become a standard record chart of Chinese music and the most authoritative and grand ceremony in Mainland China .
I should end this sentence by asking for applause .
thank you !
some people may think it &apos;s awesome to be the chief director of the party .
well , I &apos;d say , just like the slogan I mentioned before , I &apos;m &quot; meticulous . &quot;
my relationship with the ER@@ C Chinese Top Ten Awards dates back to 21 years ago when the fifth ceremony was held .
I started to work for the awards since then and I haven &apos;t missed out on any one of them .
so I feel very emotional every March , and I would post things like , &quot; This is the 19th year ; the 20th year ; the 21st year ... &quot;
why would I be so emotional ?
because I was just a handy man when I started , a nobody .
now here I put the key word , &quot; run the result . &quot;
let me give you an example .
do you recognize the lady on the left corner ?
she is a singer .
what about the one on the left ?
sorry , on the right ?
&quot; drank the poison you hid . &quot;
she &apos;s N@@ a Ying , the top popular female singer in the sixth ceremony .
further to the right , do you know him ?
yes , he &apos;s Sun Nan .
a regular award winner of our ceremonies .
but do you know how the most popular male and female singer were picked out back then ?
well , it all happened in venues like Shanghai In@@ door Stadium or Shanghai International G@@ ym@@ n@@ astic Center .
a few thousand audiences would receive a voting registration form , and they would pick out their favorite female or male singer with a pencil .
then our staff like these boys would count the votes in a room as fast as they could to get the final results of most popular male or female singer .
so literally we were counting all the votes and collecting data by hand , not by computers .
we count every one vote for N@@ a Ying and those for many other singers .
why did I say &quot; run &quot; ?
because once we had the result , the directing team would pick a good @-@ looking guy , who was not me , to run on the stage and pass the result to the host .
and the host would announce , &quot; The winner of the most popular female singer for the sixth ER@@ C Chinese Top Ten Awards is N@@ a Ying , congratulations ! &quot;
nobody cared about how many people have worked for the results behind the stage .
now that I recall , I have worked on the most trivial matters of the event , then I took care of the celebrities ,
later I was a stage director and finally I &apos;m not building a grand ceremony with my colleagues , what an amazing journey !
now I &apos;d like to have one more interaction with you , and I &apos;m sorry it &apos;s just the habit of a host .
for those who are shy , I understand and that &apos;s OK , and I won &apos;t ask you to stand up .
please note that this is a quiz without prizes , and you can see there are cap@@ tions on the picture .
this is a quiz that tells your age .
so think twice before answering it .
raise your hand if you know what it is .
those with their hands up , please tell me what it is .
great .
those who know it , you are old .
this is a Wal@@ kman !
well , I can see some young people wondering what that is .
it is a cassette player .
but now nobody uses it anymore .
one of our fellow directors is impressive , his walk@@ man plays English dialogues , while mine was all about pop music albums .
speaking of the Wal@@ kman , it is important for me as it inspired me to be a D@@ J .
I came to know some pop music from Hong Kong and Taiwan , mainly by cas@@ set@@ tes .
every time when I finished my homework , I would hide myself in the corner of the balcony , with a high @-@ heel chair and a low stool , pretending to be a D@@ J playing music on a program .
for a while my parents didn &apos;t know what I was doing on the balcony .
as I was very shy and intro@@ vert and I acted as a host hiding behind the curtain of the balcony .
it was far from satisfying to host on my own , so I needed an object as a guest .
my idols were celebrities like Qi@@ u Lin , Lin Hai , Su@@ i Lei and Xiao Lu , who were all very famous .
I chose one of them to be my goal , Qi@@ u Lin , my favorite host .
I kept writing to her upon the end of her broadcast program .
I would tell her which part of the program was good and which was not .
then the telephone came along , so I would call her and tell her things like , &quot; Qi@@ u Lin , I listened to your program today , you played a great song today and you had some great comments . &quot;
sometimes , I would call and say , &quot; I found some of your comments weird today . you are not in a good state , I heard you made 8 mistakes . &quot;
later when I recall this , I think the hosts would definitely roll their eyes when hearing people talking like that .
finally , Qi@@ u Lin was touched by my consistent calling and writing , and one day she invited me to do a program .
it was a thirty @-@ minute recorded broadcast program co @-@ hosted by an audience guest every Saturday .
and I had the opportunity to step into the broadcast tower , the glorious building in my heart .
the tower has won the Lu@@ ban Prize and I worked here for over 20 years since .
I can still recall when I first went to the program in 1997 , I asked my friend to record the whole program for me , and I listened to the recording and realized that my performance was so terrible .
because I was too nervous to speak , and I was experience voice change at that time , so you would find the recording pretty awful ,
and I would never want to listen to it again .
however , it was the beginning of my career .
in 1997 , I started to work at the radio station and my work was basic , including editing and producing , and some plan@@ nings .
I started as a handy man .
actually , these works were quite complicated for a boy of my age back then , however , most of the time we were doing some other works .
like , fetch an express delivery .
or fetch a take @-@ out delivery .
basically , 50 % of our work is about fet@@ ching delivery or take @-@ out within 100 meters &apos; distance .
you could see that there are a pile of letters , and you may think nobody would write letters these days .
however , when we go back to about a decade ago , popular hosts would receive tons of letters from their fans .
and they would have meet @-@ and @-@ great parties in a dis@@ co , the night@@ clubs back then , that could hold a thousand people to interact with their fans and audience .
one thousand fans would come just for the host , not any other celebrities .
and the host is the only shining star on the stage .
so we could say that it was the golden age of radio broadcast .
from 1997 to 2005 , I have always been wishing to have a program of my own .
nine years after I came to the tower , in 2006 , I realized my dream by having my own program , Ji@@ u D@@ ian Ren Lai Feng ( Cra@@ zy at Nine ) .
now it &apos;s been 12 years , and I would always hear people , including some of my clients saying that they have listened to my program .
some would even claim themselves as my fans and having listened to my program since they were kids .
I would sometimes find these words annoying , since I &apos;m after all not that old , although I &apos;m a middle @-@ aged man now . these sound weird .
later on someone told me that , &quot; Just think , your show has been on for 12 years . if your audiences back then were just in middle school , they are now already adults in their tw@@ enties , some may already become parents . &quot;
I worked from the back@@ stage to the front stage , from handy man doing trivial work to a host with a microphone sharing my thoughts , ideas , favorite songs with my audience .
now I &apos;d like to play a game with you , another interaction .
my bad .
thank you for your cooperation and understanding , it &apos;s just in the blood of a host .
now I &apos;d like you to make pairs with your neighbors .
be active .
you can pair with your neighbor in the left or right .
I &apos;d like you to turn to his / her ear and say one sentence only , without looking at him / her , &quot; Did you have a good day today ? &quot;
alright , that &apos;s it .
okay , you may start .
please note your tone and emotion when saying the sentence , and don &apos;t look at their eyes , no eye contact , just say the sentence .
three , two , one .
I see some of you are very shy , but some actually did as I asked .
now let &apos;s do it another way .
you still pair in two , but before you say the sentence , please smile and ask , &quot; How was your day today ? &quot;
now , three , two , one .
give it a try .
do you feel the difference ?
this comes from my years of experience as a host , as I can &apos;t see the faces of my audience , I have to be sincere to touch them and make them happy as well .
just in the same way we just did , by talking in smile and making you feel it &apos;s happy to listen to my program .
I had many fans , some of them even formed a fan club for me .
it was called &quot; Gao Shan@@ feng &quot; or &quot; Global fan club for D@@ J Gao Shan@@ feng , &quot; I can &apos;t remember if there was a &quot; global &quot; in it , anyway that made me sound influential .
I felt like a real public figure , and I was very happy .
all kinds of TV shows and programs invited me , and I felt that my life dream was coming true .
but later on , something changed in this industry in 2011 .
what was the change in the program &quot; FM 101 &quot; ?
before that , it was the the host who decided what kind of songs and how many songs to play in the program , but since that year , it was determined by the FM .
that was a trans@@ form@@ ative change .
we call it format radio , a new type of radio program .
so when you listen to my program at noon , you may find that all songs are happy and light .
and one hour later , it would be rock and roll because the host likes it .
and one more hour later , the host would play ancient and classic music .
would the personality of the host stand out this way ?
yes .
will the audience remember his music preference ?
yes .
but , the whole program is broken , without its own style .
so with the format radio , how things work ?
we let the audience decide what to play .
therefore , even if I am the D@@ J controlling the program , I can &apos;t decide what songs to play .
the audience would have the final say .
that &apos;s why we witnessed encouraging results in music radio programs especially in Shanghai in recent years .
also , we owe this to all other favorable conditions .
you all have an idea of the traffic in Shanghai , a heavy traffic load for a complicated road network .
but we would like it to be that way , as you would find yourselves trapped in the horrible traffic and could finally calm down to listen to our program .
some people would argue that they prefer to play their favorite songs on a USB .
but I &apos;d say it lacks human interaction .
also what is the biggest charm of radio programs ?
that is , you &apos;ll never know what &apos;s going to be played next .
one more thing , play the songs completely .
why is that ?
for example .
you come here today for the lecture , and the power goes off suddenly in the middle of my talk .
or , you and your lover go eat in a restaurant which you tried to reserve for a long time , and the waitress just takes your plates away for no reason in the middle of the meal .
how would you feel in such situations ？
it feels the same in music radio programs .
so we ask hosts to play songs in whole .
you may take a look at the play@@ list on the screen , in the F@@ M@@ 101 we have to play songs till the very end marked by the 5@@ 9th second in the clock .
and you may see it from the play@@ lists in 20@@ 16 , 20@@ 17 and 20@@ 18 .
you may wonder why .
it &apos;s because we have to make sure that under no circumstances should our program be disrupted and the mood of our audience should be bothered by commercials , on @-@ time alarms , weather forecasts or any other information .
moreover , we would reply to every comment you left .
comments or We@@ Chat messages , including messages on social medi@@ as like Kai@@ x@@ in@@ 001 .
why ?
because we have to satisfy the demands of our audience , as they are our clients for whom we are living .
or some audience may ask : what was the name of the song you played at what time ?
many hosts used to ignore it , as they think it was not their obligation to respond .
but I would say that they do because the audience would come back next time .
what does it mean if he comes back to ask you about something ?
it means that he is still listening to your program .
hence , our attitudes change from indifference to being friends with the audience , keeping the audience company is the value of our existence .
simply put , how to make a great companion is now the purpose of the whole radio station .
and make your audience feel that you are their friend , and that you can bring them the latest information , play them best songs , and give them lots of great prizes and bonuses .
over the past few years , people would usually ask me .
it &apos;s been years and now you are almost a middle @-@ aged man , how could you maintain such young mentality as F@@ M@@ 101 has always been a trendy program of the latest information and popular songs ?
and my answer would be very short and simple .
by getting myself a &quot; young &quot; wife .
I know you would laugh , well , actually my wife is not that young .
actually , I was referring to a young state .
well , I think it &apos;s all because we as media workers should be sensitive to fresh and new information in the market , in spite of the fact that the books we read , the movies we see , and the people we interact with would change accordingly as we age .
so , later I find myself be less inclined to get exposed to new things , especially after I began to do management a few years ago .
so it is my wife who le@@ ds me to know the current trend and new stuff .
what TV programs does my wife watch ?
the R@@ ap of China , Hot @-@ Blood Dance Cre@@ w , I@@ do@@ l Produc@@ er , and Pro@@ duce 101 .
as I passi@@ vely watched each one of these shows with her , so that I could talk about it in my program .
our audience was mainly the post @-@ 8@@ 0s and the post @-@ 9@@ 0s , so I know what they know and what they don &apos;t know .
therefore , I think I should thank my wife for her efforts in forcing me to keep up with the society .
well , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to share with you today , mainly about my career experience .
and I hope you would find it helpful .
I think I &apos;m a small potato like I said today , a mere nobody in the media industry .
and by starting from the insignificant work , I could realize the dream of my life .
thank you !
Margaret Me@@ ad , an American writer .
wrote a book called &quot; Culture and Commit@@ ment . &quot;
she proposed that in the development of mankind .
education has gone through actually three phases .
in the agricultural society .
education was called pre @-@ figur@@ ative civilization .
in the past , the productivity almost remained the same .
everyone planted food and predicted future climate every day .
so whoever lived for a longer time would have a larger say .
therefore , at that time , seniors usually taught j@@ uni@@ ors what they ought to do .
that &apos;s why you would find that in the language of Chinese .
we call our teachers &quot; Old Masters . &quot;
but later in the industrial civilization .
it changed again .
engineers and technicians would learn from each other and help each other at the same time .
in terms of design .
you need to have a designer and a structural engineer .
so Me@@ ad called it the con @-@ figur@@ ative civilization .
today we &apos;ve witnessed more changes .
my daughter was born in 1994 .
today I &apos;m confident to say that I &apos;ve lagged far behind my daughter in terms of what I know since she &apos;s been living in the Internet era .
people at my age couldn &apos;t get accustomed to or understand it .
nor would we accept it .
in other words .
young people here could teach us one thing or two .
today &apos;s event is called &quot; Festival of Thought . &quot;
which is derived from Des@@ car@@ tes &apos;s &quot; I think , therefore I am &quot; or &quot; Co@@ gi@@ to , er@@ go sum &quot; in Latin .
but in fact , people who are familiar with French know that when Des@@ car@@ tes put those words .
he didn &apos;t mean that &quot; I think , so I am here . &quot;
instead , what he meant is , &quot; I doubt , therefore , I am . &quot;
what Des@@ car@@ tes is trying to say is that everything in this world can be doubted , except the doubts of our own .
in the age of technology .
how do we re @-@ understand education and wake up our intuition ?
SM@@ G , my employer , introduced a British drama called &quot; War Horse &quot; two years ago .
which is a story that took place in World War I .
I believe that many young people don &apos;t know about the history of World War I .
how do you know about it ?
&quot; war Horse &quot; has provided you an intuitive experience to understand this history .
this horse , not a real one , was played by an actor .
but this horse has prompted people to pay attention to not only this drama but also this period of history .
he found that the core of the horse is actually people .
after the drama came out , it became a block@@ buster .
besides , it also allowed many young people and even children to re @-@ understand the history of World War I .
let &apos;s take a look at what they have done behind the scene ？
I believe that there is no book that can be compared to a drama like this one .
no one can tell a story better than a horse played by people .
this is intuition .
which helps you see the war and hear the voice of the people in World War I .
today , many people say that students learn history by rec@@ iting the textbook .
when I reported on the Athens Olympics in 2004 , I went there .
in this circular theater , I saw a lot of middle school students from the United States , Britain and Europe .
I thought they were traveling .
instead , they told me that they came here to learn history right on the spot .
history cannot be separated from reality .
neither from the environment .
just as when we speak , we cannot ignore the context .
when we soci@@ alize , we have to think about the situation .
when we make choices of life , we need to think big .
have any of you used your own way to experience the history of China or the world ?
basically , you &apos;ve forgotten what you &apos;ve learned about history .
for example ,
what logic is AI translation based on ?
there used to be three types of logic .
first and foremost , grammar and words .
for instance , eat apples ... I ... eat ... apples .
here &quot; I &quot; is the subject , E@@ AT is the predic@@ ate and AP@@ PL@@ ES is the object .
we &apos;ve been translating this way for a long time .
the earliest version of AI @-@ driven translation program was based on this principle .
later you found that the earlier version of translation machine wasn &apos;t useful at all , right ?
take these sentences for example .
Chinese team won over American team .
who has won ?
Chinese team .
to Chinese team , American team lost .
who has won ?
still Chinese Team .
the use of a different word makes all the difference .
you would find that to learn by grammar and words doesn &apos;t work anymore .
but today we still learn language by remembering grammar and words .
so today we have the second way , that is .
to collect all people &apos;s perception of this matter .
collective perception is a linguistic concept .
we collect all your descriptions to really make you understand what it means .
for example , if a person from Shanghai says , &quot; Don &apos;t be too cute ! &quot;
following the logic of the original grammar and words , does it mean you need to be a little bit des@@ pic@@ able ?
in fact , it &apos;s not .
&quot; don &apos;t be too cute &quot; is the same as &quot; you &apos;re so cute . &quot;
so here is another problem .
we need to collect more context to better understand it .
there are a lot of good classic literature .
Iike Pro@@ st &apos;s &quot; In Search of Lost Time . &quot;
if there are no relevant ready @-@ made languages to explain it .
how do we understand it ?
by emphasizing on its artistic context ?
well , then artificial intelligence has developed into the third stage today called Cross @-@ Media Re@@ as@@ oning .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
there are three things here , images , colors and sounds .
what is it doing ?
just now there were a voice , a circle and something red .
what is it doing ?
our imagination is really impaired by our education .
eat Ap@@ ples !
isn &apos;t the logic of artificial intelligence translation the same as the logic of our education ?
it makes it easier for you to understand the nature of issues when your imagination and intuition are spark@@ led .
Mr. Shen Con@@ g@@ wen was once a Chinese language teacher .
in the first lesson .
he would always let his students describe what the air in the room was like instead of teaching his students the history of Chinese ancient literature .
today we &apos;re living in the concepts of words and languages .
do you understand death ?
we used to say , death is just like this or that ...
but if I show the series of portraits of death by a photographer .
if I put all those pictures on the screen , you will be impressed and shocked .
the photographer shot a picture of one person one minute before he died and after he died to show the passing of one life .
I used this photo in the International Nursing Conference hosted in Shanghai .
the people on the scene felt very shocked .
I want to thank the German photographer for shooting pictures of hundreds of people .
by no means could such an association be clarified through simply words .
sometimes I even come to the conclusion that the later you read , the sooner you will be enlightened .
the reason is that textbooks have destroyed your intuition and wiped out your capability to associate to a great extent .
I made a TV show last year called &quot; Po@@ etry of China . &quot;
the show was well @-@ received because it gathered lots of families to recite poetry .
we used to recite poetry based on the its literal meaning .
but have you ever thought about rec@@ iting via graphics of social science ?
a professor from the South @-@ Central Min@@ zu University marked the roads all poets travelled before on Baidu Map .
you shall find out the reason of why Li Bai is so desolate .
du Fu so sad , and Su Shi so philosophical ?
it has something to do with the roads he has travelled .
so I came to a conclusion .
you have no sense of poetry without travelling afar .
you have no sense of poetry without feeling genuinely .
also , we learned the poem called A Trou@@ bad@@ our &apos;s L@@ ament as we were young .
if you have no clue about the background of this poem , you would think that it is about a kid feeling grateful for his / her mother .
but for a kid like you , if you have never been far away from your mother , how is it possible for you to actually feel that gratitude ?
this poem is about M@@ eng@@ ji@@ ao who only became a Adv@@ ance Schol@@ ar at the age of 46 .
he was extremely des@@ tit@@ ute when he was 52 years old .
he was dispatched to Fu@@ yang , Jiangsu Province .
he wrote the poem when he was a small official there .
he was 52 years old and had been away from home for nearly 30 years .
he had been hoping to be successful .
however , he was only an official of ninth grade at that time .
he remembered he hadn &apos;t seen his mother for a long time .
when he left his hometown , he told his mother that &quot; I will come to see you once I succeed . &quot;
waiting for her son for a long time , his mother had already been a grey @-@ haired woman .
the original title of this poem is Me@@ et Mother at L@@ ish@@ ui .
sewing threads in my kind Mother &apos;s hand ; She was shut@@ tling through a coat for me , a way@@ ward boy .
she se@@ wed them before seeing me off neatly closed ; for fear that I might return much too lately .
how can a blade of grass return the favor of the spring sun ?
if you &apos;re not at the age of 52 like M@@ eng@@ ji@@ ao , how is it possible that you can understand the sadness of M@@ eng@@ ji@@ ao when he wrote the poem ?
have you paid visits to mother after you travelled afar ?
check out this poem !
my friend , Professor Liu Yu from Tsinghua University has said something really great .
I am willing to copy it here today .
she said , &quot; The nature of the spirit of the university is to make human beings innocent rather than es@@ ot@@ eric . &quot;
only the innocent people would continually ask questions about the world , nature and society .
only with innocence can you become George Or@@ well .
and only with innocence can you become Einstein .
only with innocence can you become Li Bai or Du Fu .
do you still keep that piece of innocence to you ?
human beings have divided the logical world into three parts .
we are familiar with the natural world and the human world .
as we said when we were young , we had two worlds , one subjective and one objective .
the knowledge of the natural world , which has passed on to humans , forms Natural Science .
human beings change nature through their own actions , and the knowledge gained forms what is called Engineering Technology .
the result of people changing each other becomes Social Science .
now we have the third world , the information world .
our knowledge of the world , not just the knowledge .
but also the changes are carried out through information world .
the information world is also changing our lives .
but it &apos;s independent from our original human and physical world .
if you don &apos;t understand what the way of thinking means .
it is very difficult for you to realize what we should do to today &apos;s education .
in today &apos;s education , no one is born to be the teacher of someone else .
you start to build a world of information where you must learn and teach at the same time .
why do we need to learn ?
we don &apos;t just learn about a certain concept .
we &apos;re learning to acquire a way of how we think about issues .
I would like to quote a saying of Ber@@ g@@ son to leave you something to think about .
of course , this is also a wake @-@ up call for me .
he said , in many of our analysis and study .
we &apos;ve used some commonly known perception to surround beauty but never have we reached it .
is your understanding of the world also based on your concepts ?
is all your understanding of knowledge based on concepts you &apos;ve learned from textbooks ?
besides Natural Science , in the case of Social Science , we also need to deepen our understandings of what philosophy , sociology , psychology , and literature is by our own methods .
do you have such technology to create opportunities for people to experience ?
not long ago , I went to the U.S. and encountered the sister of Mark Z@@ uc@@ ker@@ berg , R@@ and@@ i Z@@ uc@@ ker@@ berg .
she told me that now no one likes to run a marathon because it was too exhausting .
you would need to be as energetic as a rabbit to finish the marathon .
later , she developed a new app called &quot; Run Fast , Z@@ om@@ bies Are Com@@ ing . &quot;
it &apos;s a game based on Mi@@ xed Re@@ ality .
you might go somewhere and find a zom@@ bie on the roadside ready to grab and eat you .
so people would run as fast as possible , saving the money they have to pay for the rabbits if they want rabbits to replace them .
the purpose of arts is to explore the boundaries of human expression .
and now the current state of technology is capable of providing all sorts of possibilities .
SM@@ G introduced a drama these 2 years .
I don &apos;t know if any of you have checked it out .
it is called Sleep No more , a type of immer@@ sive drama .
it is unconventional , not like the traditional plays that allows you to enjoy through a two @-@ dim@@ entional play@@ book .
it is based on scenarios .
if you follow different actors or act@@ resses , you have different experiences and see different plays .
you could also discover that with the emergence of panor@@ amic cameras and the 3D cameras .
we believe that the mon@@ tage of two @-@ dimensional movies will be over@@ shadowed within ten years .
because there will be a type of fully immer@@ sive movies .
but the test for us is when we shoot the films .
how do we frame the stories and where do we place the cameras ?
we all believe that the education of human culture is to cultivate a stere@@ otype of mindset .
but for me , I think all education , if not provided to cultivate a plur@@ alistic mindset , is a vice .
in other words , a plur@@ alistic mindset is the pre @-@ condition of kindness .
today &apos;s technology has allowed us to experience other people &apos;s worlds through resonance or intuition .
it is in this way that you get the chance to become more inclusive and benevol@@ ent .
thank you !
ladies and gentlemen , dear friends , good morning .
thank you for joining our speech on Arti@@ ficial Intelligence .
first , I want to show you an image of two apps that you must have used before .
they are the online payment apps , Ali@@ pay and We@@ Chat .
why do I mention these apps first ?
that &apos;s because when it comes to rob@@ o @-@ advisers and AI investment , people hold high expectations of these two online payment apps .
now that Ali@@ pay and We@@ Chat have revolution@@ ized the traditional financial industry , credit card and banking sectors .
why haven &apos;t they brought forth ground@@ breaking changes to the investment scene ?
the first issue I want to address is why Ali@@ pay and We@@ Chat can re@@ invent the financial industry .
the key is that they have incorporated themselves into the context .
when you use Ali@@ pay and We@@ Chat , one app has woven into your daily consumption context , and the other has integrated into your social scene .
from which , affiliated everyday applications have been further derived .
that &apos;s precisely why these apps have invoked epoch @-@ defining changes .
is it possible for these apps to bring along similar transformations to the investment sector ?
that is what we need to discuss today .
by revolutionary changes , I mean that people can adopt a completely different way of investment and style of living .
I am afraid that I have to disagree with the notion that super robots have far more advanced algorithms and computing capacities than the human brain .
therefore , the super @-@ bo@@ ts are inv@@ incible in the financial market , and we as humans are inferior to them and can only acknowledge their supremacy .
have you ever considered refl@@ ex@@ i@@ vity of the financial market ?
I believe many of our audiences today have read about the &quot; General Theory of Re@@ flexi@@ vity &quot; by George Sor@@ os .
every price set and every fluctuation of the financial arena are triggered by various decisions made by different market players at the same time .
therefore , your decision @-@ making is affecting the financial market .
are robots smarter than the whole human race ?
I don &apos;t think such a super robot exits , why is that ?
that &apos;s because everybody who is engaging in investment activities is in the expectation of profit .
if you hold that there is no monetary return from your investment , what will you do ?
you must answer &quot; I won &apos;t go through with the investment , and I will leave the market . &quot;
if there is a robot with super@@ computing power , which defe@@ ats every investor and fund manager in the market , what will happen then ?
no one will stay in the financial arena if they don &apos;t stand a chance to win .
in the end , the market will die .
for this reason , it &apos;s impossible that the super@@ bot scenario will happen .
in this sense , I think it is irresponsible to talk about rob@@ o @-@ advisers and the trail@@ blazing changes they bring about .
smart financial advis@@ ors offer a way to enhance our investment abilities .
enabling financial institutions and individuals to have better capabilities and make better investment decisions .
I would like to talk about individual investor first rather than institutions .
thanks to the development of inclusive finance , long tail clients .
especially many investors from the grass @-@ root level , are able to enjoy a full range of financial services like never before .
a typical example is that a sweet potato vendor on the street or even a beggar has an online payment Q@@ R code .
it &apos;s okay if you don &apos;t have the change , you can scan the code and transfer the money to them .
another example is that I want to purchase an item on Ta@@ obao , but I am 500 yuan shy of having enough money for it . my pay@@ day is next Tuesday , and I need to borrow some cash .
it &apos;s alright .
you can apply for a loan on An@@ t Financial .
therefore , inclusive finance for grassroots users is the first distinct feature of fin@@ tech .
whether it is online payment or loan services .
which financial institutions were not able to provide before , become routine and possible now .
for high net worth clients , especially for the u@@ ber @-@ wealthy individuals , they have been enjoying satisfactory services from financial firms .
they might have several financial planners telling them to buy a house today , purchase an insurance tomorrow , and optimize their overseas asset allocation the day after .
in short , the super @-@ rich are entitled to the most im@@ pec@@ cable service ever .
on the contrary , the middle class still haven &apos;t gotten the privilege to such high @-@ quality services , especially in the field of investment service .
you don &apos;t have wealth management experts to tailor @-@ make your investment portfolio for you .
therefore , it is difficult for you to accumulate your wealth .
many people even jo@@ ked that in the past ten years .
the most considerate wealth planners for the middle class are no one else but the ladies at the real estate sales office .
we believe that digital financial advisers and smart investment should focus their future service on the middle class .
and provide assistance for traditional financial organizations like ours to upgrade services .
what advantages rob@@ o @-@ advisers have over conventional financial planners ?
first , it &apos;s the coverage of the service scope .
as I mentioned earlier .
services primarily for ultra @-@ high and high net worth people will be made available for a broader client base through digital financial planners , thus expanding the service range .
another fact is that the same high net worth client will very likely receive different suggestions on wealth management by various financial planners at different firms .
the differentiation between financial advisers is not 20 / 80 anymore .
as people have told me , it &apos;s actually 10 / 90 .
it means one out of every ten advisers can provide the right financial planning for you .
that is because the abilities of the service providers vary .
why ?
if a financial plan@@ ner has a good grasp of the market trends .
he or she will prefer to be a fund manager rather than offer one @-@ on @-@ one investment advice to clients , right ?
the smart technology can enable financial advisers to offer standardized services .
by providing them with the financing tools they need to help the customers manage their assets .
my key point today , as I have been emphasizing during my speech , is that rob@@ o @-@ advisers should be an empowerment tool , not a way to replace humans .
let &apos;s take a look at the development of the U.S. market .
speaking of rob@@ o @-@ advisers , people immediately think of Bet@@ ter@@ ment and We@@ al@@ th@@ front .
why ?
that is because they are the pioneers in this field .
how can these digital financial advisers enjoy such a rapid development when they were introduced in 2008 , at the time of the financial crisis ?
before I joined the Yun@@ feng Financial Group , I had been working at a traditional financial institution for 14 years .
including the time of the financial crisis .
in the following ten years since 2008 , traditional financial institutions have been busy dealing with financial monitoring .
after the global financial crisis .
legal compliance and risk management are the top priorities among financial institutions , rather than innovation .
there was another trend which has been around way before 2008 .
prior to 2008 , around 2000 , active investment managers have already recognized the growing difficulty in beating the overall U.S. stock market performance .
as it has been tougher to out@@ perform the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500 index .
between 2000 and 2008 , there were actually many heavy @-@ h@@ itters engaging in quantitative investment .
they didn &apos;t have to conduct background research of enterprises or read the reports by the researchers anymore .
instead , they used quantitative models and indexes to navigate their investment directions , which were much more cost @-@ effective .
the financial crisis in 2008 was the trigger .
it created the necessary opportunity for online investment organizations to thrive .
it is extremely challenging for the emerging industries to overthrow the traditional ones , especially in the booming financial industry of the United States .
the tightened financial regulations on traditional firms have given the online investment industry a little bit of breathing room for development .
as it &apos;s been increasingly hard to beat the market , online platforms such as Bet@@ ter@@ ment and We@@ al@@ th@@ front decided to use the exchange @-@ traded fund tool as their underlying assets .
based on the risk preferences of the clients , the platform will generate automatic investment plans for them to carry out on a monthly basis .
better@@ ment and We@@ al@@ th@@ front are stationed in New York and California respectively , and most of their customers work in the IT sector or Wall Street .
they don &apos;t even want to come to the offices of their investment advis@@ ors and consult them the conventional way .
they just wish to finish all the asset management procedures via their phones .
many people saw the market potential in online investment .
therefore , those two firms were set up to meet the demands .
their business sky@@ roc@@ keted in the early stage .
later on , the financial institutions discovered a market for rob@@ o @-@ advisers , and investors had no problems to manage their assets online .
as for traditional financial institutions , it was a powerful tool for them to turn the table again .
as a result , three of the traditional financial institutions , namely Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b , Black@@ Rock and V@@ anguard .
have all launched their very own intelligent investment platforms .
currently , these long @-@ standing financial firms have surpassed Bet@@ ter@@ ment and We@@ ath@@ front in terms of management scale and cli@@ ent@@ ele number .
why ?
first , traditional financial institutions have solid customer bases .
and second , they offer more varieties of products without charging any consulting fees .
why is that ?
that is because those firms are self @-@ managing their underlying ET@@ F assets , while the profit model can sustain on its own without the consulting fees .
at Yun@@ feng Financial Group , we are trying to launch the 2.0 version of digital financial planners .
what are the new features of the 2.0 version ?
it has several merits .
firstly , the 1.0 version uses ET@@ F for underlying assets , while the new edition uses funds , which is a beta plus alpha investment strategy .
apart from the United States , there is a fairly large probability of beating the global market , including the one in China .
as long as the profit gained from alpha can cover the management expenses .
many people are willing to invest in the market actively .
therefore , digital advisers have given us more investment options .
secondly , we hope rob@@ o @-@ adviser service can be made accessible to ordinary investors , instead of the usual high net worth clients and financial organizations .
then what are the responsibilities of organizations ?
in fund selection , the financial organizations should conduct their due diligence in addition to referen@@ cing the indexes before giving an evaluation .
besides , fund investment is not just the initial asset allocation .
for example , you are a low @-@ risk taker , and I recommend you to put 80 % of your wealth in bonds , 20 % in some low @-@ volatility balanced funds , and call it a day .
in fact , we should always bear the concept of dynamic equilibrium in mind .
in this way , we have funds as our underlying assets and allocate our assets on top of it .
besides strategic assets allocation , we have tactical real@@ location .
when custom@@ izing personal portfolios , we don &apos;t give the same @-@ old combination to investors under similar risk preference labels .
instead , we tailor @-@ make our suggestions to suit each one &apos;s financial needs .
to cite a simple example , every one of you may have a camera .
today &apos;s cameras have manual and auto photo @-@ taking modes .
so why can &apos;t rob@@ o @-@ advisers have two modes as well ?
for a nov@@ ice investor , he or she trusts that a qualified financial institution will have his or her best interest in mind .
so they only need to tell us how much money they can set aside for monthly investment .
then we map out the plan and choose a manager for them .
all they have to do is to click a button to confirm .
there are other clients .
they have their own opinions and perspectives on the financial market and funds .
what they need is for you to provide them with the tools to assess the return rates of the funds , to see the management of the re@@ trac@@ ement ability as well as the management level of the bear and bull markets .
based on the information we provide , these investors will act on their own .
digital financial advisers , in my opinion , allow people to use different methods to achieve the goal of wealth management on the same platform .
then , the next question is how to guarantee financial professionalism .
many people may say : I don &apos;t know about investment or finance , how should I make the right decision ?
in this regard , we have made several attempts to help our users obtain professional knowledge and skills they need to optimize their wealth allocation .
we have published an article on April 1st this year on the official We@@ Chat account of Yun@@ feng Financial as a joke .
what did this article say ?
it claimed that our company had developed a new product called smart glasses .
when you wear the glasses , you will be informed of which company produces the products you see on the street .
this pair of glasses can also show you the manufacturer &apos;s performance and how it stands among industry peers .
many readers have commented down below , saying that they want to know where they can get their hands on such a novelty product .
however , that article was intended to be a pr@@ ank .
what we commit to here is not a fantasy .
in fact , we are working on how to bring investment opportunities to the everyday living scene .
we have also done some experiments .
we have embedded a photo recognition function in our app .
as you go to the supermarket , you take a photo of a product , and the app will give you information such as the company &apos;s stock code .
so far , we have only added data from three industries , namely food , beverage and catering .
in the second half of this year , the database will be able to cover all sectors .
the users just need to take a picture of the trademark label , and they will be notified of whether this item is made by a listed company .
which quoted company it is and how its performance is in comparison to industry counterparts .
that used to be something un@@ fath@@ om@@ able in the financial industry .
in the past , you were told to read the research report of a particular firm .
it would be best if you studied the listed companies first before knowing what products they sell .
however , it &apos;s a different story now .
the investment opportunities are lying within your everyday lives .
I know that very well because I &apos;m a mother .
I study the maternal and child industry when I shop for my kid .
I may have a little more understanding of the industry than the analysts who are unmarried .
I know which company has the best product and why , as well as why this company has direct investments , like the back of my hand .
a lot of the knowledge in our daily life can be transformed into investment knowledge .
there is one more thing .
I have just mentioned personalized investment demands .
the fact is , everybody has their own investment needs , and not everyone will end up with the same investment decisions .
what do I want to stress with this ?
many people might wish for a robot that can come up with the perfect investment plan for them and help them to manage their wealth .
however , everyone has a unique situation .
when investing , you should not only consider investment methods or asset allocation .
people have different cash flow requirements . , various risk @-@ resistance levels .
when it comes to investment periods , some people may want a short investment time , while others are committing to long @-@ term investment .
for me , artificial intelligence is here to provide you all the information and tools you need to make investment decisions .
investing is about concentrating on every decision you made as an investor .
you cannot give away this right to others out of laziness .
at the end of the day , you are the one who &apos;s responsible for your wealth .
as an AI service provider , our job is to enable you to make the best possible financial decisions , not to make those decisions for you .
thank you all !
good afternoon everyone .
my name is Zhu Ye .
my major is architecture , so the theme I &apos;m going to share with you this afternoon is &quot; the secret of streets and the possibility of public art . &quot;
streets are actually a public space that we are familiar with and an important form of public space .
in a nut@@ shell , as Jane Jac@@ obs says .
&quot; streets and their side@@ walks , the main public places of a city , are its most vital organs . &quot;
let me start by showing some pictures of streets in our daily life .
this picture is actually the Shanghai street@@ scape , right ?
you can see just from these pictures that streets are actually a mix of traffic and all sorts of things .
streets have various names and every street has its own name .
for example , the names of Shanghai streets contain all Chinese cities &quot; names .
streets also form different communities , alleys and lanes .
which are presented in their own unique ways in different cities .
with people coming and going , bust@@ ling streets actually become flowing spaces .
containing traffic flow , people flow , logistics and information flow , all of which constitute the streets in our daily life .
streets are also the carrier of various businesses .
such as shopping malls , pedestrian streets , general vendors , markets , etc .
of course , there is another side of streets , a side from the top down where lots of bottom up stuff resides .
such stuff , we often call informal , shows a spontaneous form .
which means that we can make use of all possible spaces appropriately , such as the two sides of side@@ walks , over@@ passes and so on .
some of the more important places in streets will be pedestri@@ an@@ ized , to which only pedestrians have access .
meanwhile , streets are filled with advertisements .
including audio @-@ visual and other forms of advertisements .
there are also various information and written messages presented on streets .
such as information for rent and messages related to old traditions .
meanwhile , as urban spaces themselves are graded , streets will naturally be ranked during the development of cities .
also , streets need to be cleaned daily , so they are public spaces for daily use .
what &apos;s more , we can see children on streets .
they may regard streets as a place to play games . we also see people of different ages are using streets .
including the elderly , who have to communicate , interact and chat with others .
we all need to go out for a walk , such as students who fall in love .
they stroll down the street instead of always staying on campus .
all these are our daily life .
we can stand or take a standard posture called Chinese squ@@ at on the street to chat with others .
if you are tired when walking on the street , you can rest on the street .
in fact , there is such a possibility , right ?
if not , you can use other facilities on the street to have a rest .
thus it can be seen that streets have the closest relationship with human body .
after all , it &apos;s people who are using the street .
at night , we can see different street scenes which can &apos;t be seen in the daytime .
they are a part of our daily life .
but what has changed in our city ?
this is data from 2011 .
now the urbanization rate has reached 53 % or even higher .
more than 50 % people have already lived in cities .
this is the so @-@ called urbanization rate .
urbanization is actually a flow and convergence of various elements .
with the development of urbanization , elements such as people flow , logistics , information flow , and wealth are rapidly gathering in cities .
how do these elements come together ?
it is actually achieved by making differences .
China was on a very even footing of development 30 years ago .
it is the differential development strategy that has produced today &apos;s cities and various urban ag@@ glomer@@ ations .
which are mainly distributed in the Yangtze River Delta , the Pearl River Delta , and the Bo@@ hai rim .
to develop public transport , these cities have to build ring roads , constantly expanding the city scale .
for example , Beijing has already built the sixth ring road .
in this way , our past mode of life was changed .
what kind of mode ?
it &apos;s the way people used to live in the planned economy era in China , known as the unit model .
under such a model , the places where people live is related to their jobs .
their public life was under the supervision and observation of others .
there were various living facilities in such compounds .
including hospitals , primary schools , kindergartens , can@@ teens , cinemas , swimming pools , etc .
but actually , this kind of compounds and spatial model in China dis@@ integrated with the advent of the commodity society .
what we get instead are residential quarters as the picture shows .
these residential quarters are often large @-@ size and large @-@ scale .
since 1998 , China has entered the era of residential commerci@@ alization on a large scale .
there are pictures of different residential quarters in the world .
these dark @-@ colored on the left are foreign residential quarters .
actually , they are blocks .
all these pictures are in the same proportion .
these on the right are Chinese residential quarters .
moreover , we can see that Chinese residential quarters are actually closed and capital @-@ admitted with an access control system .
and there are only one or two entr@@ ances in such a large area .
people won &apos;t go there if they don &apos;t live there .
in fact , the commerci@@ alization of housing in China has destroyed the original urban mechanism , such as the block mechanism showed in the left picture .
moreover , the relationship between the residential area and the city is actually negative .
such commerci@@ alization of housing since 1998 has also brought about a major change .
the separation of residence areas and work places .
this separation leads to people starting to buy vehicles , and the city scale has been continuously expanding .
living in a residential quarter like this , you don &apos;t know who your neighbors are , do you ?
unlike in the compound , you know all your neighbors .
you know Zhang San , Li Si , and even the Master Wang in next door .
but in the new residential quarter , you may have lived for years without knowing one of your next @-@ door neighbors .
the only thing you know is that your neighbors probably have a similar income level like you .
because they can buy a house about the same size as yours at the same price and live next to you .
so let &apos;s take a look at a few pictures here .
they are about the changes of Chongqing in 19@@ 44 and 1993 when this city developed slowly .
the area in the middle is Yu@@ zhong District .
the city of Chongqing , sandw@@ ich@@ ed between two valleys and mountains .
has developed from the north to the south since it upgraded its status to a municipality in 1997 .
by 2012 , its urban scale had been expanding , even exceeding the scale reached in its north @-@ south development .
because of the possibility of public transport , numerous tunnels have been opened and the city has been expanding to such a scale .
but what is the major addition that actually contributes to the scale today ?
it is the increase of road networks .
due to the large city network , the city achieves expansion by firstly completing the accessibility of vehicles .
this is a group of photos by Y@@ a Ni@@ u called &quot; So Near , and yet So Far . &quot;
seeing from the photo , we seem to be very close to the city .
but the city actually provides services for vehicles .
vehicles are very far from our body , because they are something that wrap@@ s our body inside .
similarly , we live in such model @-@ like residential quarters in the photo .
once I went to Spain myself .
this is a picture of Barcelona , and the green road in the middle is Ram@@ bl@@ a .
this was my first trip to Spain .
but I found this street was highly recognizable and I got a conceptual anchor point which was proposed by Kevin Lynch in his book The Image of the City .
that is to say I take this street as my first and the whole identification point in the city .
so what makes this street different ?
look at the picture on the left .
it &apos;s the street Ram@@ bl@@ a , and its car lanes are spread out on both sides where one way drive is required .
however , the whole middle of the street is actually for pedestrians .
there are caf@@ es , food and beverage outlets , newspaper stands , and chairs for rest in the walking area of the street .
that is to say such a large area in the middle of the street serves as a park with markets nearby .
so the street is easy for me to recognize when I first went there as an out @-@ of @-@ town stranger .
then I just walked around the square .
no matter how I walked around , I could always find the street and avoid getting lost .
so I quickly built up a sense of familiarity with this strange city .
in fact , everyone can know a public space , a city and a place through his perception of streets .
on both sides of Ram@@ bl@@ a , there are many small corners and squares where streets meet for people lingering around .
I can go back to street anyway .
so I &apos;m not afraid to get lost .
as a tourist , I was thinking , this is a tourist street .
so what about the other streets in Barcelona ?
so I walked around the city again during my itinerary and found streets here were very interesting .
many craw@@ ler lanes are specially built on one side of these streets , while another side is for fast traffic .
this layout is actually much like the scaled @-@ down version of Ram@@ bl@@ a .
putting public spaces in the middle of the street and car lanes on both sides .
I suddenly felt there was something different .
because as a walker , I only walked and didn &apos;t drive in this city , and I felt my body was comfortable here .
I do feel it and it doesn &apos;t need to be told .
as an individual , I st@@ rolled around the city and felt really good .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
so I thought about my home in Guangzhou and felt it very troublesome .
there is a stadium next to our home called Yan@@ z@@ ig@@ ang Stadium .
nearby residents can find no other public spaces , so they , especially at night , have no choice but to take walks in the stadium .
when I became a father , I would walk here with my st@@ roller in the evenings when I was free .
in this stadium , there is basically no space for running at night .
that is to say , our city lacks public spaces .
another place I would like to take my child is W@@ ank@@ el@@ i , a commercial space next to my home , featuring a large area .
then I doubt whether the streets are really built for us ?
when thinking about it , I find that streets , as a public space , do not belong to anyone .
but to various units , as there are a lot of units managing them .
for example , of the man@@ hole covers and various pipe holes dug in the streets .
some may be used for telecommunications , some for the network , and others for televisions .
therefore , Chinese streets are actually divided .
as a real public space , streets actually have not been taken seriously .
so I wonder is there any other possibility for such an important public space ?
once I saw R@@ unning Man , an interesting Korean variety show .
in this show , all members play games in the public spaces in various cities .
the screen@@ shot here is the episode in Hong Kong .
they play games inside the Central @-@ Mid @-@ L@@ evels E@@ scal@@ ators in the Central district .
people have places in a city to play games , suggesting a high affinity between human body and the city .
this is an interesting case of the possibility to use the city public space .
so is there any other possibility ?
then I kept looking for and found this , Madrid R@@ IO .
in fact , this is a ring road constructed around the city of Madrid .
after the completion of the ring road , the builders found that the road isolated the traffic on both sides .
and it would take more time for outside people to enter the city .
so they came up with an idea , spending huge sums on fl@@ atten@@ ing the ring road into a square and making vehicles go underground .
in this way , dozens of parks and hotels were newly opened in this city .
and the walking distance from the new urban zone to the old town has also been greatly shortened , which actually increases a possibility of the public space .
well @-@ known examples also include the High Line Park in the United States , a recreational park where people can rest and relax . it is actually transformed from abandoned railway tracks .
another example I like very much is architect Liu Ji@@ ak@@ un &apos;s work West Village , a dou@@ gh@@ nut @-@ shaped courtyard .
in the midst of the courtyard are many sideways .
which actually form a community service center , a large community service complex .
commercial spaces are located on both sides of these sideways and at the ou@@ ter@@ most of the courtyard , making room for other sub@@ spaces and walking spaces .
it can be seen that as a comprehensive building , it has such possibilities .
this is T@@ ent@@ acle Park , the design of which was based on the study of Sha@@ bei Street , Sha@@ zh@@ eng Street in Chongqing .
by elev@@ ating the ground we build a public park that is connected with surrounding buildings .
our city has a lot to do with wal@@ kers , with our bodies .
however , once the city gives the priority to vehicles and traffic .
streets would be separated and the two sides of the streets become visible but un@@ tou@@ cha@@ ble .
people need to get to another side by crossing over@@ passes or under@@ passes .
this is hard for the elderly or for everyone when there are no escal@@ ators .
in fact , people have rich life on both sides of the street .
the spaces behind mountainous area in Chongqing are very interesting .
people like to live in somewhere behind the main street for there are lots of spaces .
sometimes , they even use a little public space under the tree to do housework , making the city squares on the main street empty .
then we proposed the plan of T@@ ent@@ acle Park .
which may share some similarities with the High Line Park , but more interesting .
first , it deals with the problem how to provide a public space that does not conflict with the road network .
second , it is expected to create more spaces .
in the mountainous terrain , it can be connected to both the third floor and the first floor , and can act as a sun@@ shade when the second floor is built .
this is what we want when designing it .
OK , let &apos;s just skip over these pictures .
this is a three @-@ dimensional profile of what we have imagined .
it is actually a network system built on the original street for wal@@ kers .
this system is designed for wal@@ kers .
when you walk , your body can easily feel whether it is comfort .
maybe you get tired and want to rest when walking for one kilometer .
and older people want to rest when they walk for a shorter distance .
however , such public space and service facilities for pedestrians are very scarce in our city .
the secret of streets lies first in our exploration of our body and the possibility of walking .
first of all , our body is extremely sensitive to the walking distance .
and even a little bit longer distance can make it feel tired .
however , wal@@ kers are insensitive to inter@@ sections .
if two cars colli@@ de , the consequences may be serious .
but it doesn &apos;t matter if two people colli@@ de in the street .
then , we have far more choices when walking than what can be cho@@ osen when driving .
from place A to place B , you can choose any route you like .
Chinese gardens are often impressive because of the diversified paths .
in addition , our body is also highly sensitive to the urban form ,
such as the floor materials , the ven@@ eer and materials used on the surface and in the buildings .
it is easy for us to take a walk .
so we envisage that there should be more possibilities for walking networks in the future and we need to create more places in the city that combine with public spaces such as streets .
as for street , an important form of public space .
we should explore more to help us walk and make our body feel comfortable .
our imagination for public space is actually rooted in our daily needs and our bodies .
and the possibility of public art also comes from our daily life .
thank you all !
the topic for my presentation today is Desig@@ ning the Future .
why do we call it Desig@@ ning the Future ?
because today we are talking about education , and education is about the future .
well , my previous career actually had a lot of anno@@ tations .
between 1998 and 2009 , a period lasting for 10 years , I was an architect .
I built nearly 400,000 square meters of public buildings during this period of time .
even in Tong@@ ji University , a higher education institution well known for its architecture discipline .
I might have been a relatively productive architect compared to my peers .
but when your career is moving to a certain stage , you &apos;re certain to encounter a lot of problems .
between 2003 and 2005 , I began to reflect on my own work .
I &apos;ve designed quite a few schools .
this school was built in 2004 , and it is about 14 to 15 years old now .
when the school was first put into use , everyone was telling me , &quot; This school has been beautifully designed , it is like a garden . &quot;
the school was actually located at the out@@ skirt area of a city .
prior to the development of a new zone , a city will normally set up schools over there .
I kept thinking these questions in my mind , &quot; Is it good or bad for designing a garden @-@ like school ? what can I do as an architect ? &quot;
I came to realize that , as an architect myself , I could do very little about it .
schools like this one are far away from the city center .
basically all of the students &quot; lives , their studies and social activities are taking place within this school , a school surrounded by walls .
you know , when you have stayed inside the walls for a long enough time , you will gradually lost your ability to adapt to the life outside the walls .
it is the same for a city .
if too many stories are kept inside the walls , and the city will have much less stories to tell .
starting from 2007 , I made up my mind that instead of spending most of my time in building the shell , I mean the buildings as a form of material space structure , why not to do something related to content ?
and from that time I started focusing most of my energy on the development of College of Design and Innovation of Tong@@ ji University , which was originally a department and later became a college .
in line of this year &apos;s Chris Ran@@ king , our college is the highest @-@ ranked design institute in Asia .
we have the highest ranking among all disciplines and higher education institutions in Shanghai , and we rank the 18th in the world .
however , there is something far more important than the ranking itself .
we are a college of design , what kind of design do we do ?
in fact , back in 2009 , Tong@@ ji University decided to take the entire Department of Art and Design out of the original College of Architecture and Urban Planning .
and set up an independent new college .
at that time we organized an extensive two @-@ day workshop .
inviting the world &apos;s best design educators , design researchers , President of World Industrial Design Association and representatives from relevant professional organizations to carefully consider this question .
&quot; if Shanghai has to set up such a design institute , what should it be like ? &quot;
we agreed on a general direction that this new college should focus on design @-@ driven innovation and teach students with knowledge that would stimulate innovation .
it is interesting to see how this college grows , but the fun part is that this college is constantly creating something new .
you have already seen the Sino @-@ Finnish Center , which was set up in 2010 .
and by 2011 this center and D. School of Stanford University were praised by the mon@@ oc@@ le Magazine as the world &apos;s most innovative platforms for higher education .
all our students , without exception , are required to learn open @-@ source hardware and programming in the first semester of their freshman year .
in other words , all our students , without exception , are ready to enter the B@@ it World .
since day one of entering into our college , all our college students are exposed to a new design concept where the Atomic world and the B@@ it World are flaw@@ lessly integrated .
apart from this technical aspect , our students are required to keep a close eye on social issues .
for example , I created a project called Des@@ ign@@ Harv@@ ests , in 2007 .
it was a valuable learning experience for my students in taking part in the project .
in addition , they were required to face some major challenges , such as the sustainable development of rural China .
you might have noticed that there is an ongoing exhibition , somewhere near the Tong@@ ji Pavilion , and it is an exhibition organized by our students .
actually they are our last year &apos;s students .
the exhibition features their design works with a theme of saving and protecting rh@@ ino .
so you can tell that , besides the technical aspect , our college also values highly of social care and humanistic care .
and more importantly .
we are looking for a new way of education .
for example , this is the front gate of our F@@ ab Lab .
you can see that whenever there is a lecture or seminar , all passing @-@ by students are welcomed to stop and listen .
there isn &apos;t any teacher doing the roll @-@ call , and our teachers won &apos;t tell you that &quot; you can only leave after having listened to my lecture ; it is a way of you showing respect to me . &quot;
not at all , you can sit down if you like .
or you simply walk away if the topic is un@@ attractive to you .
it reminds me of the Confucius &apos;s way of teaching .
the Confucius had a great vision for the entire world .
he and many of his disciples travelled through all the kingdoms .
the purpose of the travelling was to promote Confucius &apos;s thoughts .
he would begin his class under a tree , and he didn &apos;t have any so called advanced teaching equipment at all .
of course he didn &apos;t have any textbook .
the An@@ al@@ ects of Confucius , a collection of Confucius &quot; verbal expressions , was entirely compiled by his disciples .
if Confucius had to undergo modern professional title appraisal .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s likely he would barely make the mark as a lecturer .
besides our students , our college values highly of the sense of community .
our college has organized many activities .
as the dean of this college , I know little about what &apos;s going on , as these activities are entirely run by our teachers .
and gradually we have formed a unique culture .
our F@@ ab Lab is made open to the public , and we start organizing open @-@ day events during weekends .
as a result , residents from the nearby communities gather together under the e@@ aves of our college , and learn all kind of hardware related knowledge .
our college also becomes the playground for many children .
from 2015 , our college started deepening cooperation with S@@ ip@@ ing Community .
by making full use the knowledge sp@@ il@@ lover effect of our college , we want to slowly improve the community .
you know we now have a large number of on @-@ going projects .
for example , our college used to have a Glass Lab , and later it was moved to a new location within the S@@ ip@@ ing Community .
we even invited Shanghai Glass Museum to take part in this joint project .
we end up building a community @-@ based Glass Workshop .
this is a Media Lab jointly developed with MIT , whose predecessor was a garbage station of S@@ ip@@ ing Street .
we later transformed it into a world @-@ class science lab .
we believe that in the future a community will have important intellectual resources .
the demands are generated within the community , and people who are able to address these demands live in the community .
to us , a community is actually an extension of a university .
in an effort to better interact with the nearby communities , we have applied the use of many technologies , including data technology .
we have installed a lot of probes and cameras within our labs and streets within the community .
why do we need to do this ?
it is necessary to do so . we can obtain direct feedback on every change we have made to the community through data collection .
and the information will be used as a useful reference to influence the community for the next time .
from this point of view , the whole community becomes a future @-@ oriented laboratory ; while a university becomes an open maker space .
this is the Sino @-@ Finnish Center .
we are opening an inter @-@ disciplinary program , and all students are from different academic background .
you can see how they interact with each other at this program .
it is fascinating , isn &apos;t it ?
take a look at this new community @-@ based project .
we call it the Pro@@ tot@@ ype Street .
after we have obtained the maker space in the community , we introduce this lab .
you &apos;ll find that the boundary between a community and a university now becomes bl@@ urry .
of course in this Pro@@ tot@@ ype Street , we mainly think about our lives in the future .
we then turn different strategies into a business prototype .
once meeting with capital investment , the prototype can directly result in a company .
at the same time , the online and offline modules are connected .
a higher education institution can do many interesting things .
when talking about the education of design , you might find out that a middle school is less interesting than a university .
this is a classic picture of high school students doing their assignments , and the reality might be even worse .
I have been thinking of this question for a long time .
is it possible to have a brand new mindset and create a new education possibility ?
the existing mainstream education model has played a significant role in improving the quality of Chinese people .
however , there are some students who are unable to benefit from this mainstream education system .
within this system , you &apos;re required to be exactly the same with your peers , as the definition of excellence is set the same .
as the saying goes , thousands of troops are crossing a single @-@ log bridge .
I first had an idea of setting up a new middle school back in 2015 .
firstly it was just an idea , then I even wrote a proposal , but didn &apos;t find a chance to make it come true .
with this proposal on our hands , we kept looking for a chance to build this kind of new school .
and interesting enough , finally Huang@@ pu District accepted our idea .
in June 20@@ 16 , director of Education Bureau of Huang@@ pu District and me signed a cooperation agreement , and this middle school was therefore named Tong@@ ji @-@ Huang@@ pu School of Design and Innovation .
the school has an ideal location , somewhere near the Bun@@ d of Shanghai .
the school &apos;s predecessor is Pu@@ guang Middle School and Chinese Y@@ M@@ CA Secondary School at the very beginning .
I@@ e@@ oh Ming Pe@@ i , Run Run Shaw and Chen Yi@@ fei all graduated from this school .
apart from its ideal location , what &apos;s interesting is that the school has a very innovative education model .
our conventional education model is subject @-@ based , in other words , we teach subject @-@ based knowledge to students , including mathematics , Chinese , geography , chemistry , history and biology etc .
there isn &apos;t much cros@@ sover among different subjects , or even these subjects compete against each other .
when we were students at that time , our dog@@ ge@@ rel was - M@@ ath , physics and chemistry are the strongest power to the world .
but nowadays young kids might say that &quot; Those who have mastered Chinese language can rule the world . &quot;
with the advance of the times , we will find out that the focus is different .
but there is something more interesting .
our world is not decided by any subject @-@ specific knowledge .
our school therefore has a very different education model .
the subject @-@ based programs only account for 60 % of our curriculum design , and we will do something else with the remaining 40 % of the curriculum design .
we will have a question @-@ based education .
in other words , students won &apos;t be asked to deal with any abstract proposition related to Chinese , mathematics , chemistry and physics .
instead they will be asked to deal with a very specific proposition , such as river pollution at the Suzhou River .
this proposition , in fact , is a combination of different issues in the fields of history , chemistry , physics and mathematics .
and the key is how we have designed the angel of this proposition .
so in this school , 40 % of the programs are question @-@ based , and we want to cultivate students &quot; knowledge application abilities to deal with cross @-@ situ@@ ational problems .
I had an in @-@ depth dialogue with teachers from this middle school last semester , expressing my high hope for this question @-@ based program .
I told them that it was not mysterious at all , but a collection of application questions .
students were required to apply inter @-@ disciplinary knowledge to solve one problem .
as of now , 40 % of this question @-@ based P@@ P@@ L program has been taught by teachers from our college , and the rest are taught by middle school teachers .
we have reached a tacit agreement with the middle school , hoping that more and more middle @-@ school teachers will be able to teach this question @-@ based program in the future .
at this middle school , we want to cultivate students &quot; innovation ability , self @-@ care ability of daily living , the ability to handle a research project , the ability to apply scientific knowledge , leadership and self @-@ learning ability .
we hope that graduates from this middle school will have the consciousness of innovation and the design thinking ;
however , we don &apos;t wish that all of these students continue their studies on design .
the future of these students shouldn &apos;t be limited to becoming a designer .
they should become the re @-@ defin@@ ers of the rules of the game in every sector of our society in the future .
as for the running of this school , we hope that it will be made open to the communities .
and in return , the communities will constantly provide resources to the school .
anyone who is familiar with me might know that I have spent a considerable time on design @-@ driven urban @-@ rural interaction .
10 years ago , actually 11 years ago , I did a project called Des@@ ign@@ Harv@@ ests .
we tried to incorporate some of our ideas , including the concept of urban agriculture , into this project .
we are doing the same when running this school .
our students will learn how to grow vegetables and how to raise fish in the school .
as I have mentioned before , the open @-@ source hardware and software system are linked together .
therefore a student can monitor the growing condition of the vegetables or the fish through a P@@ ad or a cell phone .
he can even adjust the intensity of artificial sunlight , the humidity level and irrigation system .
we are now working to develop such a system .
this is a simple video clip of this school .
you can tell that , compared to a conventional school , this school has a totally different space design .
our school is particularly spacious and open .
you know , 40 % of our courses are project @-@ based , and therefore we hope that our school can provide an environment that is good enough to support comprehensive and flexible project @-@ based education .
of course the idea is great , but it is not easy to transform the idea into concrete action .
we signed the agreement in 20@@ 16 , but only started en@@ rolling students in 20@@ 17 .
this is an enrollment advertisement that was posted at the Union Church of the Bun@@ d in April this year .
that was a great gathering of many people as it is today .
Russell once made a speech at this church more than 100 years ago .
and from certain point of view , it was meaningful for us to run the enrollment campaign at this church .
of course we couldn &apos;t bypass the senior middle school entrance examination , but we want to have an initial screening on our candidate students .
that is why we invited candidate students to have face @-@ to @-@ face interviews at our college .
the logic is simple .
a student will only be allowed to apply for our school before passing the face @-@ to @-@ face interview .
the interview was very interesting .
when students arrived at the event venue and sat down , they were very nervous and had no idea of what the interview would be like .
they kept making phone calls to our teachers , &quot; How is the interview arrangement ? what kinds of books do we need to read in advance for the interview ? how can we better prepare for the interview ? &quot;
our teachers told them , &quot; You don &apos;t need to do anything , please make sure you arrive on time . &quot;
it was a big surprise to them when they read the interview questions .
why ?
the questions were .
how to work together ?
how to live together ?
how to stay old together ...
these were all major challenges .
in a very short period of time , these students opened their heart .
take a look at this picture , featuring how the interview was run that day , and many students appearing on this picture were later accepted and studied in our school .
please take a look at the girl on the right side of the picture .
she was undertaking an interview . she wanted to know what the world would be like if she was a person with visual impairment .
that is an important element of design , we call it empathy .
in September 20@@ 17 the middle school officially opened .
the school has been put in trail operation for a year , and during this period of time , many incredible stories occurred .
when we began en@@ rolling new students this year , we decided to invite last year &apos;s students and their parents to share their experience .
one of these student speakers was particularly interesting .
when he first entered our school , in his teachers &quot; words , &quot; he was unable to open his mouth , &quot; that is to say , he was not able to have a normal communication with others .
but one year later , he was able to take part in a speech contest .
I don &apos;t know whether he has won any award for the speech contest .
he now becomes a cheerful and outgoing person , and a transforming change does happen to him in a year .
his father also gave a speech on the stage , describing the major changes happening to his son last year .
then this student added something very interesting .
he said , &quot; I &apos;m not the only one who has grown up , my father and mother are also growing up with me . &quot;
so in their eyes , and from them , what I see is hope , what I see is the future .
our students also open a We@@ Chat public account , sharing their ideas in studying in our school .
it is effective in promoting the image of the school , and helps students consolidate that knowledge they have learned .
since its very inception to now , I have found one thing that particularly touched me .
that is , this school has become a focus of public attention .
for example , till now Huang@@ pu District has already had three party secretaries .
and no of them ever asked me this question , &quot; Professor Lou , do you have any previous middle @-@ school @-@ running experience ? &quot;
no one has asked me this question .
I don &apos;t any previous middle @-@ school @-@ running experience .
if I had been asked this question , it was unlikely that the school would become successful at all .
many parents end up bringing their children to our school .
some students &quot; enrollment decisions were made at a family meeting .
some students insisted in applying for our school despite that their parents didn &apos;t agree .
other students had been given the chance to study at a prestigious school in Shanghai , but they quit and chose our school instead .
there are many of these touching stories .
we are thinking about how to connect education with games .
the future @-@ oriented education must be driven by personal interest .
I keep saying these words , &quot; Our kids are done if they don &apos;t know how to play . &quot;
kids are done if they don &apos;t know how to play .
so , the next thing we want to think about is how we can connect education with playing .
I have shared with you many personal stories related to education in today &apos;s presentation , but what to want to tell you is this - there are needs that don &apos;t exist in the first place .
it is likely that Shanghai don &apos;t need such a school .
but there is such a need inside everyone &apos;s heart .
it is only because the need hasn &apos;t been addressed yet .
so finally when the school is made open , you soon realize that not only Shanghai but also many other places are in need of this kind of school .
that is why I say that , &quot; Some of the needs did not exist until they were created . &quot;
this is the motto of our college .
to learn and create for a meaningful life and a better world .
let us encourage each other in our endeavors .
thank you .
hi !
I am the founder of M@@ ant@@ ou Business School , and I am a new recruit in the education industry .
before I started M@@ ant@@ ou , I had been working in Internet companies , as a programmer for three years , and then as a product manager .
I was probably one of the first @-@ generation product managers in China .
the topic I would like to share today is challenges faced by the vocational education for the new generation in the workplace in the era of internet .
this is a passage shared by Mr. Ma Hu@@ at@@ eng , Chairman of T@@ enc@@ ent , at the beginning of his new book .
he shared the view that we are experiencing one of the largest migr@@ ations in human history .
new humans have emerged .
compared with their predecessors , the post @-@ 9@@ 0s and post @-@ 00@@ s are not merely changed by times .
they are the new generation sp@@ awned by the internet , and they are completely different species from their predecessors .
we often talk about internet transformation and internet plus .
however , compared with internet transformation and internet plus , he described it as a larger migration .
just as Columbus discovered the New World , human beings are now migr@@ ating from a physical planet to a digital one .
and these entrepreneurs are the captains of the voy@@ agers in the digital age .
in this era of digital change , you will find that the humanities are renewing and the media are also updating .
what are the post @-@ 7@@ 0s and post @-@ 8@@ 0s called in the digital age ?
immigrants .
I went to college in 1992 , and I didn &apos;t get into computers until I went to college .
but the kids today , including my daughter , have been able to use an iP@@ ad since they were born .
my daughter has already learned to download games from the Ap@@ p Store , such as An@@ gry Bir@@ ds and hop@@ sc@@ ot@@ ch , and she plays very well .
the post @-@ 9@@ 5@@ S and post @-@ 00@@ s are the natives of the digital age .
in this scenario , you can find that the media have undergone a significant update .
it used to be a slow age , but now it is a fast age .
it used to be the era of hierarchy , but now it is the era of fl@@ atten@@ ing .
it was the age of reason , but now it is the age of perception .
the media are updating and the humanities are renewing .
which poses even greater challenges to new careers and new workplace .
if you think about our parents , what did they usually do ?
my parents are doctors .
they have been doctors all their lives .
but in my generation , I was a programmer , a product manager , and now an educator .
recently , we have established a major of new media .
we found that many of the students who came to the new media major were from 4@@ A advertising companies .
these companies were supposed to be the best of their time .
why are they learning new media now ?
we don &apos;t read newspaper or watch TV that much now .
do you turn on the TV less often now ?
these traditional media have been greatly challenged by the internet .
take product manager for example .
we found that among product managers and people engaged in professional interaction .
some ma@@ jo@@ red in English , mathematics and even psychology in college .
their majors are varied .
at the same time , many product managers are transferred from other positions .
for example , some of them are former engineers or te@@ sters .
some are from marketing or business departments .
so , when we do job training or new job training , we often face the challenge .
what should we teach our children ?
in the past , people served the organization , but now each of us is not a screw of company as before .
we are free .
we can work during the day and be D@@ idi drivers at night .
entrepreneurs and freel@@ ancers will gradually become the mainstream .
compared with people , organizations have also undergone tremendous changes .
in the past , the organization was hierarchical , with the boss at the top , and then mid @-@ level managers and then employees at the bottom .
but you may find that there are more and more people in the company who can be called &quot; special forces . &quot;
they can research and develop , program , and even design products .
such people play an increasingly important role in the organization .
since people and organizations have changed .
educators , especially those of us who are vocational educators , should also adjust to these workplace changes .
what we feel is that the content in the field of workplace education is pol@@ arizing now .
some of the content is cutting edge , and students particularly need solid skills to excel in their job search .
it breaks the limitation of time and space in form .
and what remains unchanged is the soci@@ alized learning mode .
I founded M@@ ant@@ ou Business School in 20@@ 14 .
before that , I worked in King@@ soft , when we went to college every year to recruit college students .
at that time , the company had a &quot; three @-@ session &quot; system , that is , the company should have a director , an HR specialist and a V@@ P to attend the interview .
this is to ensure that the quality of the recruited students is better than the company average .
I was probably the only one interested in people in the company .
so I went to almost all the job fairs every year in different universities , including Tong@@ ji University .
I found something .
back in 20@@ 13 and 20@@ 14 , internet companies , including our company , were in severe shortage of product managers and operators .
however , you could not find many such majors in college , right ?
it seems that product managers are rarely taught as a major in universities .
now it seems that there is a major called product interaction design , which was rarely found a few years ago .
even from elite universities , most students spent their first year in the company learning and practicing .
so , I think there is a big gap between the market demand and college education .
for entrepreneurs , what we see is opportunity .
then we were thinking about building such a university that ex@@ poses students to new technologies .
especially the new positions emerged in new scenarios before they step into the workplace .
that was the school we would like to establish .
to build the school , I visited many companies , especially those &quot; model enterprises . &quot;
I have been thinking in my mind that when knowledge is no longer rare resources .
when we can search anything that we want to know on Baidu , what will schools be like ?
what role will the school play in education ?
I was particularly impressed by two spaces and fields .
one is a temple near Beijing , named &quot; Long@@ quan Temple . &quot;
you &apos;ve probably heard of it .
Long@@ quan Temple is a very interesting temple .
ordinary temples are for closed @-@ door practices .
but the concept of Long@@ quan Temple is to open the door .
whether you are a Buddhist or not , you can go to Long@@ quan Temple for one or two days short practice .
also , there is a cute robot monk named &quot; Xian &apos;@@ E@@ r &quot; in the temple , right ?
if you like , you can follow its public account on We@@ Chat , and have some short conversations with &quot; Xian E@@ r . &quot;
I have been thinking that as there can be a wall @-@ less temple , can we build an open school ?
this is my first thought .
and about the second , in 2012 , I visited Stanford University .
as anyone who has been to Stanford University knows , it has no gate .
you can &apos;t find a sign that says &quot; Stanford . &quot;
what attracted me most about Stanford University was actually its faculty .
many of its teachers have triple identities .
the first identity is of course teachers at the school , right ?
the second one is usually angel investors of some start @-@ up companies .
and another identity is senior managers of some big enterprises .
these three identities are perfectly combined in a teacher .
they use the Industry @-@ University @-@ Research results achieved in the school to the company for verification .
and then take the verified results and summarized theories back to school to share with the people there .
I was wondering if we could run a school like this .
in the ancient Chinese text , the word &quot; study &quot; is represented by these two characters .
the first one &quot; X@@ ue &quot; looks like a person analyzing the div@@ in@@ atory symbols and another person watching .
the other character &quot; Xi &quot; is even more interesting .
the upper part is &quot; yu , &quot; which means feathers , and the lower part is &quot; ri , &quot; which means every day .
we just talked about schools .
when knowledge is no longer scarce resource , what role does the teacher play ?
the character &quot; Xi &quot; gives the best answer , and it means a lot of practice , just like a bird learns how to fly .
we need the knowledge , and more importantly , the practice .
this is what we Chinese call the unity of knowing and doing .
I have been saying that in the field of education , there is an important model called AS@@ K .
which means At@@ titude , S@@ kill and Knowledge .
we need to turn knowledge into ability , from the brain to the heart and the hand .
the combination of the three is the purpose of learning .
in M@@ ant@@ ou Business School , we always say that many people are studying to avoid growing .
it is like that a patient carrying a bottle of medicine , taking one pill in the morning and another in the evening with warm water .
will everything just get better then ?
now , in this era of knowledge explosion , knowledge is really increasing .
we can gain more and more knowledge on all platforms .
but how much can we really use ?
when more and more knowledge is available and less and less can be really used .
the gap between knowing and doing will be wider and wider , and people will be very anxious .
so , we have been thinking that teachers can to some extent be models .
that is why we chose the name &quot; M@@ ant@@ ou , &quot; which sounds like &quot; M@@ ent@@ or . &quot;
the teachers &quot; knowing and doing can be models that tell students the right way to combine them .
I was lucky .
when I first entered the workplace , I chose King@@ soft in 1999 .
our boss was Mr. Lei Jun , a well @-@ known hard worker in the IT industry , the founder of Xia@@ om@@ i .
our company was small at that time , with a team of probably only 50 people .
we were just a bunch of college students back then .
what did we do together ?
we had a reading club called &quot; Meeting on Wednesday . &quot;
more importantly , we shared some of our daily work for review .
we found it really helpful during that period .
in fact , in China , when college graduates choose their careers .
they do not have a good understanding of what they are going to pursue in the future .
to me , my parents had been telling me that I had to master a skill .
so I became an engineer , writing codes .
however , after I started working , I was once asked if I would like to be a product manager .
I knew nothing about product manager at that time .
I said no and that I would like to be a programmer , because programmers were ge@@ eks in my mind .
they were with clear minds and had the ambition to develop cooler technology .
he asked me a question , &quot; Wang , do you have a poetic feeling when you write code ? &quot;
I said no , and he said , &quot; That &apos;s it . &quot;
when you really like something , and when you are really good at it .
your career will be a part of you , and your career and you form a complete unity .
sometimes we may feel confused about our career , probably because we need a chance to explore it .
when we started the business , we chose the word &quot; M@@ ent@@ or &quot; and gave our school the name &quot; M@@ ant@@ ou . &quot;
we would like to invite those who have experience in the workplace .
especially those who have practical experience , to our school to give lectures .
we are now developing &quot; M@@ ant@@ ou , &quot; but it is more like running a big experiment .
in our minds , it is not necessarily a better university that sub@@ ver@@ ts college education .
but something that is hard to describe clearly .
it can change the structure of education in the process of development .
and bring in more people with higher quality .
we &apos;re wondering if we can give everyone a chance to be a teacher .
can lifelong learning really become possible ?
can we break through the walls of business schools and make it affordable for those who can &apos;t afford it ?
and can we apply what we have learned so that students can earn their tuition fees back even when they are still at school ?
can they participate in project operation at school ?
can we break through the geographical restrictions and make people in remote areas equally have access to education ?
in addition , do we have to study in class ?
do reading , traveling and talking count ?
I think , in fact , the big platform of Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u is a kind of wider learning .
so , what &apos;s the last thing I want to share with you ?
one day , my daughter asked me , she is six years old by the way , and you know that kids have a lot of questions that are really hard to answer .
her teacher asked her , what does your mother do ?
so , she came and asked me .
I told her that I was an educator .
then she asked , &quot; Mum , what is an educator ? &quot;
it is really a hard question to answer .
I thought about it for a really long time .
I didn &apos;t have an answer until I met Teacher Gu D@@ ian .
we talked about this topic .
he said that &quot; ed@@ u &quot; of the word education came from Socrates .
it means channel , symbol@@ izing guidance .
the purpose of education is not to cultivate students to become a screw of company or country .
it is to channel out of his heart that beautiful thing .
after hearing this , I was so moved .
I think that &apos;s what education is all about .
it &apos;s about lighting up , not insti@@ l@@ ling .
every one of us has good things in our hearts .
and education is to help us find them so that people can become what they really are .
thank you !
hello , everyone !
my name is Xiang Jia@@ qiao , a sop@@ hom@@ ore at New York University Shanghai .
first , I want to ask you a question .
did you ever dream of traveling around the world in your childhood ?
have you realized it ?
many people may not be able to make it for the time being .
but in the past year , I was lucky enough to have a 101 @-@ day round @-@ the @-@ world voyage through the Sem@@ ester At Sea study abroad program .
this is our route .
as you can see , we started from San Diego and travelled all the way to Hawaii .
and to Japan , to Shanghai and Hong Kong , and then to Southeast Asia , such as Vietnam , Myanmar and India .
then we sailed to the African continent to Mauritius , South Africa , Ghana , and Morocco .
finally we arrived in Germany .
on the M@@ V World O@@ dys@@ sey , there were 5@@ 36 students , 23 professors , and dozens of lifelong learners .
and we travelled around the world during the 101 days .
the ship is where we lived in the past 101 days , and we travelled 26@@ ,000 miles through 11 countries .
many of you may have no idea what it means to travel 26@@ ,000 miles .
look at the statistics .
our voyage covers a total of 4@@ 2,@@ 2@@ 36 kilometers , an equivalent of travelling the equator for 1.@@ 05 l@@ aps .
this was calculated at the end of our trip and turned out to be very interesting .
we consumed 9.@@ 5 million lit@@ ers of purified water , 3 million lit@@ ers of fuels , 1.4 tons of peanut butter , and 650 kilograms of strawberry jam .
the statistics may seem staggering but this trip has almost consumed the least fuel and water in the history of the program , about 20 % less than the last trip .
then this is the interior of our cruise .
the upper left is our dormitory , which is divided into inner and outer cab@@ ins according to its prices .
the outer cabin allows you to see the sea .
there are two @-@ bed and three @-@ bed rooms .
I lived in a three @-@ bed room in the inner cabin .
and my two room@@ mates come from the US and Peru .
this is a picture of the window of the outer cabin .
that picture , where a lot of people were standing , is the auditorium .
meetings and general courses all took place there .
we attended a course called Global Studies .
in which the teacher would inform us of the politics , economy , history and culture of each destination before we reach it .
this is one of our classrooms , and due to limited space , we have to make the most use of the space on board .
for example , the dining hall serves as a restaurant when it &apos;s time for meals .
but at other times , it would be converted to be a classroom .
the last picture is our deck !
as you can see , there &apos;s some food on it .
it is also very interesting when we enjoy the sea on the deck during lunch , chatting as we eat .
you may ask why I participated in the Sem@@ ester At Sea program .
it took me almost a year to get the offer , because I had to write an application , apply for a scholarship , and wait a long time for my visas .
the program is very unique , and unlike other projects , each scholarship is independent of each other .
so to get a scholarship , you have to write different applications and letters of recommendation because each scholarship has a different focus .
for example , some may attach importance to your academic performance or your social activities .
and some may be targeted at specific groups , such as ethnic minorities or international students .
and this way , it can attract these kinds of students .
after months of preparations , you naturally hold high expectations for the program .
so when I told my friends I was going to take a cruise around the world .
they burst into admiration , &quot; W@@ ow !
so romantic !
I also want to go there . &quot;
another friend en@@ visi@@ oned a trip where I would suffer from seas@@ ickness and j@@ et@@ lag , chase the sun and there will never be sunset , enjoy the beautiful sea , bas@@ k in the sun , read books and update the latest moments in We@@ Chat .
it would be a wonderful experience !
before the trip , I held the same vision , but it was far from the real case .
since the cruise travelled across four continents , it is naturally a mobile classroom .
but as a closed space , the cruise is a stable classroom in a sense .
so between such mobility and stability , how could we achieve the balance ?
how did the whole environment affect us ?
these are some of the interesting things I &apos;m going to share with you .
well , my first point is actually about the relationship between people .
after I went on board , I found my previous vision of reading a book and updating my latest moments on We@@ Chat every day quite impossible because this was a world without Wi@@ Fi .
we could see nothing but the sea .
the only way we communicated with the outside world was through an e @-@ mail that could only send text .
but later on , you would find life in such a Wi@@ Fi @-@ less world also very colorful .
you would find the things you normally don &apos;t do turns out to be very interesting .
each day , outdoor activities on the deck are packed with people , including the tennis court , the basketball court , and the gym .
some classmates even brought the Uk@@ ul@@ ele or the guitar .
they could attract a large group of classmates each time they played it .
and in the evening , we would play the once popular board games together , including the interesting We@@ re@@ wolf .
this Wi@@ Fi @-@ less world allows us to conduct more in @-@ depth and convenient communication .
there was a time when I was chatting with my classmates late at night .
during diner , we would normally choose a table for nine , including four American classmates , four black classmates and me .
to get to know each other , we introduced ourselves with the three most @-@ asked questions .
a brief self @-@ introduction , the reasons for choosing the program and the most appealing country .
many of us , including me , expressed our expectations for Africa .
we wanted to see wild animals in South Africa and to ride a camel in Sahara .
so our topic naturally revol@@ ved around the African continent .
the black students began to tell us about the history that we seemed to have never heard of before .
including black heroes and some very important historical events .
well , the American classmates and me widened our eyes with surprise .
we had absolutely no idea about this history .
and when we said we had no idea about that , one black classmate said it was because current history books were hardly written from the perspective of the Black people .
so the books would naturally ignore much of the black history .
this is actually quite interesting .
well , then I asked him why he wanted to study in the US ?
in a very serious tone , he said he wanted to acquire a little knowledge in the US and return to make his contribution to the African continent .
he firmly believes that Africans are very intelligent , and that the African continent has a promising future .
their perseverance in their eyes may involun@@ tarily remind you of the first group of Chinese students who ventured abroad to study a few decades ago .
and who held the same ambition of acquiring enough knowledge from foreign countries and drawing on it to protect and serve our country .
so in such an ambitious young people , we see an Africa full of hopes .
another interesting thing is that we actually felt restless at times on board .
as I just mentioned , without Wi@@ Fi , we could have in @-@ depth talks every day .
and everything seemed to be quite normal and peaceful .
but as we started a nearly one @-@ week trip from San Diego to Hawaii .
the topic suddenly turned when the cruise was about to reach Hawaii .
our topics seemed to suddenly revol@@ ve around our desire for the civilized world and Wi@@ Fi .
and a day before the ship arrived in Hawaii , when the ship regained access to the telecommunication signal , we all became excited .
with different dial@@ ects and languages , the students hurried to report the peace to their family or friends , and some begun to update moments in social networking sites such as We@@ Chat and Facebook .
it &apos;s quite interesting to see the sudden change of attitudes .
to sum up briefly , you will find the relationship between people turns out to be more intimate in such a small space .
we may have different cultures , values , or viewpoints , and but on the cruise , we have more direct communication and interaction .
many times I may not agree or identify with the relatively extreme opinions of the other party .
but this does not prevent us from respecting each other &apos;s views and conducting discussions .
because the truth will be fur@@ thered by discussions .
the second point I want to share with you is the relationship between human beings and nature .
in the ocean@@ ography class , the professor mentioned the relationship between man and nature .
the professor encouraged us to go to the top of the deck every day to observe the surrounding environment .
because our route colli@@ ded with the two areas where there are the largest number of the world &apos;s whales .
ideally , we were told to take a photo every day and write a nautical diary .
but in fact you can see nothing but the sea and water .
it &apos;s not hard to understand .
I knew in class there are deserts in the ocean just like the land .
just as there are roads on land , there are routes in the ocean .
our ship travelled the fixed routes , and most of the routes were deserts .
at the end of the semester , we calculated and only a small portion of students were lucky enough to see the whale .
I saw two po@@ ds of dolphins , one pod heading in the same direction as our ship , and the other pod towards the opposite direction .
you could see the marine animals that are not in the zoo or the aqu@@ arium but sliding past you .
it &apos;s really a wonderful feeling to interact with nature .
well , before the trip , we studied every day , and we had no weekends .
and on board , we studied two or three days a week , this was called &quot; Study Day . &quot;
one Study Day just colli@@ ded with the day we crossed the equator .
during Study Day , we would hold different events , such as the maritime Olympics .
this is the tradition of the Sem@@ ester At Sea program .
I think it is also a particularly good way of communication between man and nature .
because a long time ago , the marine navigation technology was not as advanced as the present ones , it was quite impossible to cross the equator .
previous explorers would be very frightened when they arrived near the equator , so on that day , all other sailors would be off @-@ duty .
they would sacrifice their pigs and lambs to the sea gods to pray for safety and a smooth journey through the equator .
however , modern navigation technology is so advanced that we do not need to follow the ancient rituals , but we still stand in awe of nature .
well , there were very interesting activities on the day when we were crossing the equator .
for the second half of my journey , I kept wearing a hat and my hair just grown back .
you may also be interested in seas@@ ickness .
many of you will ask me if I suffered from seas@@ ickness .
the answer is definitely yes .
but for the vast majority of the time , our boat was still very stable .
but in our trip from the San Diego to Hawaii , a professor left after he suffered from seas@@ ickness and went home .
another professor was dispatched from the US and f@@ lied over to us to continue the class .
well , the overall situation is still very good , and there is also an unlimited supply of medication against seas@@ ickness .
but I only had it twice during the entire voyage , because after taking it you would feel sleepy for more than ten hours .
some people cop@@ ed with it quite well , but I was not well adapted , especially when our ship arrived in the African continent .
it begun to shake heavily , and encountered some storms .
it was easy for the professor to fall if he or she didn &apos;t grasp a platform like that .
when you slept at night , it was like going through a roller coaster , and you would move with the waves .
the most serious case occurred on one evening , when all the plates in our dining hall slipped out of the cupboard and broke .
as you can see , this is the African continent and that is the European continent .
this is our trip from Africa to Europe .
the cruise was originally scheduled to land in Hamburg , Germany , but as we can see from the pink area , there is a storm .
that is also a storm , and this storm is still forming .
that is to say , if we stuck to our original route and ventured to Hamburg , Germany , we would certainly encounter the large circle of storms .
in that case , the wave may reach as high as 11 meters to 17 meters , and the ship would absolutely not be able to bear it .
so in the end , the captain decided to change a route and headed to Lisbon , Portugal , and our 102 @-@ day flight was shortened to 101 days .
this is a real pity .
there were storms , but there were also beautiful memories .
this was one of three nights when we switched off all the lights so that we could see the stars on the sea .
we saw a cluster of stars on the deck with the naked eye .
the Milky Way is visible to the naked eye .
this is what we saw with the naked eye , very beautiful indeed .
this is the sunset .
one advantage of travelling on board was that we could watch the sunset on the sea every day .
so every day at about five or six or seven pm , the deck was full of people appreciating the sunset .
another merit is that the program gives me a chance to remain temporarily detached from the civilized world in such an Internet age .
since our generation , the communication between people and nature has been diminishing and it seems that people are sp@@ ell@@ bound by We@@ Chat and the Internet .
and it seems we begin to forget the pure connection between nature and nature .
the third point that I want to share with you is China and the world . this may seem to be too general .
only seven out of the 5@@ 36 students on board are Chinese .
but among the 14 ports we passed , there are two important Chinese ports : Shanghai and Hong Kong .
so we were as precious as the giant pandas .
especially when we were arriving in Shanghai , all other people asked us about the must @-@ go places and must @-@ eat foods in Shanghai .
so on the ship , we were also a group that attracted much attention .
when it comes to the relationship between China and the world , the first thing I want to share is related to the visa .
well , many netiz@@ ens have complained that the Chinese passports only allow the holders to visit a limited number of countries visa @-@ free .
but this is not how I see it .
another thing I like about the program is that it makes me feel that the Chinese passports are becoming more powerful .
and that Chinese students need to apply for a smaller number of visas each year .
from the beginning of our session , we only need to apply for six passports .
namely the US , Japan , India , Ghana , South Africa and the EU .
our most recent benefit was in mid @-@ 20@@ 16 , when Morocco granted the visa @-@ free to the Chinese .
which was once one of the most difficult visas for Chinese students in this program .
in previous programs , Chinese students could not dis@@ embark in Morocco because they did not get a Moroc@@ can visa .
so a powerful China actually brings us greater convenience .
another thing I want to mention about visa is that of the EU .
there is a very strange rule , that is , you must submit the application 90 days before the trip .
our program lasted more than 100 days , which meant that I couldn &apos;t obtain an EU visa in Chinese mainland .
there were also cases before when the Chinese students had to get off the ship in Morocco because they didn &apos;t get the EU visa .
so they missed the graduation ceremony and also the most rewarding and memorable period .
we were very concerned at the time .
we have been contacting the European Embassy and the German Embassy in Osaka , Japan by e @-@ mails .
but we were still denied the visa , because it would take at least 10 to 15 work days to before a visa was issued .
we were out of options .
in the end , we went to the German embassy in Beijing .
and the officials contacted the embassy in Japan and helped us with our application through e @-@ mails .
when we arrived in Japan , we rushed to the German Embassy in the first place .
and the staff looked at us and asked whether we were from the Sem@@ ester At Sea study abroad program .
I was very happy at the time because I knew I could get the visa .
and on our last day in Japan , we finally got our visa , which was great .
well , the journey from Japan to Shanghai is an adventure for foreign students .
but for us , it was actually hom@@ ec@@ oming .
we celebrated the New Year on the sea .
during that journey , when we were still surrounded by the sea , my mobile phone picked up a 3G signal .
and the first thing we did was not to check our We@@ Chat or contact our family .
but to open the online shopping app and buy some hot@@ pot seas@@ oning like Ha@@ id@@ il@@ ao , so that we could bring them to the ship .
one the New Year &apos;s Day , our Chinese students opened the hot@@ pot seas@@ oning and then cooked it .
it was especially ceremonial and brought me back home in an instant .
in Shanghai , I first took a few friends to Ha@@ id@@ il@@ ao and helped them discover authentic Chinese food .
this shows our Chinese students and several international students celebrating the Chinese New Year .
we booked a dinner for the New Year &apos;s Eve on board .
of course , we just ate steak .
it was a strange but unique experience .
this photo was taken on the first day of the New Year &apos;s Day .
we were crossing the Straits of Mal@@ acc@@ a and maybe we were close to the land .
so we could pick up signals from Indonesia or Malaysia from time to time .
then we were watching the Spring Festival G@@ ala on the phone , and this made us feel at home .
in fact , when it comes to China &apos;s relationship with the world , you will find that China is moving step by step to the world stage .
and foreigners want to understand China , especially many of my friends .
as we set off for the next destination , they told me Chinese food was the best food they had ever eaten in their lives .
Chinese students who study abroad or participate in this program , and who may have the opportunity to go abroad as students or tourists .
should take the responsibility and obligation to help China better communicate with the world .
in a foreign country , you may be the only channel for foreigners to understand China .
you are the messenger of cultural exchange .
let &apos;s return to the voyage map .
actually , when I was preparing for the speech , I wondered whether my sharing would revoke some thoughts in you without sounding like fortune cookie comments .
I wondered if I could call on everyone to pursue their dreams and have more thoughts about life .
after the journey at sea , you may ask , why did you travel around the world in the first place ?
what can the program bring me ?
or what will it bring you ?
after a brief talk with my teacher , I came to realize that maybe travelling around the world requires no particular reason or values .
it might be the most instinc@@ tive and primitive impulse of human beings .
every young people is the inher@@ itor and successor of human civilization .
we should embrace the passion to explore the unknown world .
well , return to our program .
as we can see , the cruise is called the World O@@ dys@@ sey .
why ?
why named the ship after the epic of the ancient Greek poet Hom@@ er 2,@@ 800 years ago ?
my guess is that the program expects us to show bravery and learn to deal with difficulties just as the hero O@@ dys@@ sey did in his 10 @-@ year journey at sea .
there &apos;s a saying of the program , you may not see it very clearly , but we don &apos;t call it motto .
it &apos;s a saying that goes &quot; The world is our campus . &quot;
and on the second floor of the building of New York University , Shanghai , there &apos;s also a motto saying &quot; M@@ akes the world your major . &quot;
with translation , the two sentences convey almost the same meaning , that is , making the world your classroom .
this is really the case .
the world is a gigantic classroom , and each of us is a unique individual there .
our initial instincts and our dreams determine what we do and what we will do in this class .
finally , I want to end my speech by wishing you could find your in@@ ner@@ most thoughts , pursue your own instinct , and sail through wind and waves in the classroom of the world !
thank you !
I &apos;m Chen P@@ eng@@ fei , from the School of Astr@@ onomy &amp; Space Science , Nanjing University .
I feel quite honored to be invited to Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u and have a chance to talk about this bright star : the Sun .
actually it is so bright that many astronomy enthusi@@ asts just can &apos;t help looking directly at it through their bin@@ ocul@@ ars .
that &apos;s all right at night , but might harm your eyes in the daytime .
so we often warn those enthusi@@ asts against a direct gaze at the Sun through their bin@@ ocul@@ ars .
if you really want to aim your eyes at the Sun , remember , you can only do that twice in your whole life .
first , look with your left eye , and then switch to your right eye .
over two thousand years ago , scientists like Aristotle and P@@ tol@@ emy insisted that the Sun , along with all the other planets , was moving around the Earth .
during the Renaissance , however , scientists like C@@ oper@@ nic@@ us and Galileo began to realize that the Sun was actually the center , orb@@ ited by all the planets .
their proposition that took the Sun as the center of the universe , however , also proves wrong today .
the truth is that the Sun , and the eight planets in the Solar System , are all circling around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy .
despite the prevalence of the ge@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric theory in ancient times , the Sun was still passionately wor@@ shi@@ ped by our ancestors , who even built temples for it .
in China , the Sun is associated with a lot of classic tales , such as &quot; Hou Yi Sh@@ o@@ oting Down the Sun &quot; and &quot; Ku@@ a Fu Ch@@ asing the Sun . &quot;
why did the Sun , though it was not considered as the center of the universe , still get so many wor@@ shi@@ pers in ancient times ?
it is simply because that the Sun is the source of energy for life .
without the heat sent by the Sun , in only a week the temperature of the Earth would plunge to over 20 degrees below zero .
give it several more weeks or months , and the temperature would even drop to over 200 degrees below zero .
the incoming sunlight contains approximately 13@@ 60 wat@@ ts of energy per square meter .
some of it is absorbed or reflected upward by the atmosphere .
only about a half of the energy can finally reach the surface of the Earth .
here is some basic information about the Sun .
its mass is 1.9 x 10@@ 27 ton , or , to make it more understandable , 0.@@ 33 million times that of the Earth .
its semi @-@ diameter is about 0.@@ 69 million kilometers , or 109 times that of the Earth .
that means the Sun can accommodate 1.3 million ear@@ ths at a time .
the Sun is not so dense , its average density about 1.4 times that of water .
but it is very uneven in density .
the core of the Sun is 100 times as dense as water , while the surface of it only has a density of one ten million@@ th of that of water .
that &apos;s really sparse .
the temperature of the core is also very high , and it can get up to 15 million degrees Celsius .
the further it gets away from the core , the lower the temperature is .
and the Sun &apos;s surface temperature is only 5@@ 700 degrees Celsius .
as for the composition of the Sun , 90 % of its mass consists of hydrogen .
less than 10 % of it is mostly helium , and the rest 1 % or so is made up of the chemical elements it shares with the Earth , such as carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and iron .
some of us may wonder , since we &apos;ve never been to the Sun - and surely it &apos;s impossible for us to go , for we would be melted down by the terrible heat .
why are we so sure about its composition ?
the answer is that we can analyze the sunlight .
we all know that , as light passes through a triangular pr@@ ism , it will change into a collection of component colors such as red , orange , yellow , green , indi@@ go , blue and violet .
we call that the spectrum , which actually contains several different spectral lines that correspond to different elements .
some spectral lines may be peculiar to iron , and another line may point to another chemical element .
in that manner we can finally know what chemical elements constitute the Sun and how they are distributed .
the next question is , why can the Sun shed light ?
that &apos;s because within a quarter of the Sun &apos;s radius , temperature and pressure can get so high that a hydrogen fusion reaction will occur .
four hydrogen atoms might colli@@ de with each other and change into a helium atom .
but four hydrogen atoms are 7 / 1000 times heavier than a helium atom .
that &apos;s to say , when the four hydrogen atoms become a helium atom , their mass is reduced by 7 / 1000 .
according to Einstein &apos;s famous equation .
e = m@@ c ² , any mass might transform into a tremendous energy , which makes the sun burn and shine .
the energy of the sunlight approaching the Earth is measurable .
so we can use the equation again : divide the energy we have measured by c ² , and finally get how much mass the Sun burns and loses every second .
the result of the calculation is shocking .
4 billion kg per second .
some people may ex@@ claim , &quot; It &apos;s so horrible ! the Sun is losing a large piece every day , and soon there will be nothing left ! &quot;
take it easy .
even if its mass keeps decreasing like this for another 10 billion years , the total loss will account for only a minimal 1 / 1000 of it .
don &apos;t worry .
tomorrow we still need to go to school .
on mentioning the violent hydrogen fusion reaction at the core of the Sun , some of us might imagine the inside of the Sun as a burning hell bro@@ iling with cruel turmoil .
that &apos;s not true .
if we use the energy the Sun produces in our study , it might be only enough to light a 100 @-@ wat@@ t bulb .
the reason why it &apos;s so bright is that it &apos;s huge in volume .
sometimes when I tell others that my job is studying the Sun , they will just dis@@ believe me .
for all they can see , the Sun is only an ordinary , bright ball hanging there , except that sometimes its brightness might be tar@@ n@@ ished by some black spots emerging on it .
but if you watch it through your bin@@ ocul@@ ars , you will find it completely unlike what you have imagined .
for example , this sun@@ spot seems to be very small , but observed by bin@@ ocul@@ ars it will display a more detailed structure , as well as some dynamic changes .
around it there are many rice @-@ grain @-@ shaped structures , which we call the &quot; rice grains . &quot;
only that these grains , measuring 100@@ 0@@ km in length , are far larger than the rice grains in our kitchen .
tiny as it looks , this little sun spot is three to four times as big as the Earth .
the number of the sun spots changes by day , whereby the brightness of the sun also varies .
here we can see how the number of the sun spots has changed ever since 1978 , the year that marked the beginning of the Reform and Opening @-@ up .
there is an 11 @-@ year cycle .
the red line indicates how the brightness of the visible light of the Sun has accordingly varied .
there has never been a more than 1 / 1000 growth or decrease of the brightness .
but even this insignificant 1 / 1000 change can influence the climate of the Earth .
different climates lead to differences in thickness of the tree rings .
so we can see that tree rings also have a 11 @-@ year cycle , in which they gradually get thicker and then thinner , and so on , and so forth .
meanwhile , there are also varied crop yields and crop prices .
an extreme example was about the Ming Dynasty .
in the late years of the dynasty , the number of sun spots plum@@ meted .
from 16@@ 45 to 17@@ 10 , in particular , there was almost no sun spot .
that was about 70 years in total .
during those 70 years , the earth was also experiencing a small ice age when temperatures were the lowest in history .
the cold weather decreased crop production , for example , the orange trees in Jiangxi Province couldn &apos;t even fruit .
to sum up , first there were fewer sun spots , then the less bright sun , then fewer incomes for peasants , and finally the peasant u@@ pris@@ ings .
so the overthrow of the Ming Dynasty might also be attributed to the sun spots .
it was not all the Chong@@ zhen Emperor &apos;s fault .
at that time , Europe was also caught in a cold time span .
farm@@ lands near the Alps were covered with snow , resulting in famine among common people .
there is a stra@@ it between Denmark and Sweden .
by then , Swedish had co@@ veted the territory of Denmark for a long time .
however , the stra@@ it was not easy to cross .
but as the temperature fell , the water froze , which offered the Swedish troops an opportunity to cross and easily occupied Copenhagen , the capital of Denmark .
the increase of sun@@ spots also brings outbreaks like solar fla@@ res that release the energy of 100 billion of atomic bombs and cause intense mass e@@ jection in half an hour or an hour .
this is a solar flare that happened at a tiny place on the sun .
we observed that one billion tons of substances expanded to become bigger than the sun and then were e@@ jected away at a speed of one thousand kilometers per second .
with that speed you can arrive in Beijing from Shanghai in one second .
well , this motion graph shows that a solar flare breaks out and lets out one billion tons of substances towards us at a speed of over one thousand kilometers per second .
but we are lucky , because the earth &apos;s magnetic field and atmosphere protect us .
the e@@ jected substances are blocked by the magnetic field , but also change it at the same time .
in this way , some particles are accelerated almost to the speed of light and slam into the atmosphere , thus generating the wonderful aur@@ ora .
these are some photos of aur@@ ora .
magnificent , aren &apos;t they ?
some Chinese aun@@ ties fly to Europe specially to view aur@@ ora .
but if you are a researcher of the sun , you can see it in your office .
the earth &apos;s magnetic field changes when squeezed by the substances .
as we learnt in middle school physics , changing magnetic field can generate electric field .
the most typical example occurred in 18@@ 59 , during the Second O@@ pi@@ um War .
that year witnessed an intense solar outbreak .
the electric current resulted from it gave an electric shock to many tele@@ graph@@ ers , for their tele@@ graphs sparked .
people hastily cut off the power in the hope to eliminate the electricity .
however , to their surprise , the tele@@ graphs still worked even they did so .
another example was in a cold winter in March 1989 when another solar outbreak hit the earth .
the transformer of a hydropower station in Quebec of Canada burnt out , as you can see in the left bottom of the screen .
the station actually provided electricity for Quebec and five to six states in America .
this picture shows the lights of those cities at night , which was caught by the satellites of Canada and America .
the shutdown of the station caused widespread black@@ out , making six million people suffer from the col@@ dness of winter for 9 hours .
the damage caused by solar outbreaks to human life amount to billions of yuan every year .
now that we know the severe damage , many think of the idea whether we can foresee solar outbreaks through researches .
just like what we do to study wea@@ thers and forecast if it will be cloudy , rainy or sunny tomorrow .
if it &apos;s going to rain , we can bring an umbrella , right ?
we all know Richard F@@ ey@@ n@@ man , the great physicist .
well , his sister Joan F@@ ey@@ n@@ man , also a physicist , found a fascinating rule .
for instance , if a solar flare is going to appear here , then a small sun@@ spot will emerge from the solar interior the day before , just beside the sun@@ spot .
there is a rule that the anode of the emerged sun@@ spot will be close to the cathode of the original magnetic field , forming an offset .
in such circumstances , outbreaks will occur .
this rule is quite instrumental in our forecast of the solar outbreaks , right ?
although these difficulties are solved , there are also plenty of un@@ solved difficulties pertaining to the sun .
for example , I just mentioned that the temperature of the sun &apos;s surface is only 5@@ 700 degrees .
remember that ?
but the temperature of its atmosphere is 1 million degrees .
extremely high , isn &apos;t it ?
so we may not understand how this is happening .
this is a question .
second , its atmosphere is actually not still .
instead , it continuously pu@@ ffs wind away .
we call it solar wind .
the speed of solar wind is 700 kilometers per second , much higher than that of Shanghai &apos;s wind .
it carries 1,500 million kg of substances from the sun per second .
in addition , as I said before , nuclear fusion occurs at the center of the sun , which burns up 4 billion kg of substances per second .
in aggregate , the sun loses 5,@@ 500 million kg of weight per second .
it is huge , so to speak .
so when the mass of the sun decreases , the sun &apos;s grav@@ itation to the earth will also drops , right ?
then the earth will run away from the sun , right ?
as for the escape speed , every year the earth is a little away from the sun .
at present , the earth moves 1.6 cm away from the sun every year , which is not so many , isn &apos;t it ?
but it brings a rather intriguing question .
we know that the sun &apos;s longevity is 10 billion years .
so far , it has been 4.6 billion years , with 5.4 billion years remained .
5.4 billion years later , it will become a red giant that continues to expand .
for example , assuming this point is the current sun , then this big one will be the sun in 5.4 billion years .
it will swallow the Mercury , and then the Venus , and then expand to the place further than the orbit of the earth .
hearing this , you may think that the earth will definitely be engul@@ fed , right ?
it is actually not so simple , though .
by then , the solar wind will be much more intense , which means the sun will lose a lot of mass .
then its grav@@ itation to the earth will also decrease , and the earth will further escape , right ?
so , after 5.4 billion years , if an alien sees the earth , it will find it interesting that the sun continues to expand and is about to swallow the earth , while the earth is escaping fran@@ tically .
as for the question that if the sun will swallow the earth , I don &apos;t know , and no one knows now .
people are still arguing over it .
one of the reasons for the argument is our lack of knowledge of the solar wind .
we simply don &apos;t know how strong it will be .
if it is weak , the earth will fall into the sun 。
if it is strong , the earth will get away .
China also plans to launch an advanced space @-@ based solar observ@@ atory in 20@@ 22 in a bid to explore the solar fla@@ res and cor@@ onal mass e@@ jection .
we already know that 5.4 billion years later the red giant will start to expand .
and 6 billion years later , the sun will lose half of its mass , and the remnant will rapidly collapse to the same size as the earth .
so you can imagine , the collapsed sun will be rather high in density .
it will become a white dwarf .
with a high density , it will mainly consist of carbon and oxygen .
hydrogen and other substances will have been depleted .
so , even if the earth survi@@ ves the sun &apos;s expansion , the solar system will no longer be suitable for us to live .
you must feel scared about it , right ?
many may think that human being will become extinct when the day comes .
but there are things actually more wor@@ ris@@ ome .
the sun is gradually heating up .
in 1 billion years , the sun will be hot enough to dry the water in Huang@@ pu River , and even in the Pacific Ocean .
by then , the Antarctica will be the only one oasis on earth .
so we can live with the pengu@@ ins .
well , in 2 billion years , the water in the Antarctica will also evap@@ orate , and the earth will then become a globe of ground .
so do we need to get worried about it ?
I don &apos;t think so . with only three hundred years of modern science , we are able to mount the moon and even to the Mars .
now we are searching for planets outside the solar system , especially a habit@@ able one .
in case you suffer from night@@ mares getting worried about the safety of our offspring in 2 billion years , I &apos;d like to quote a sentence from H. G. Wells .
&quot; life , always resur@@ rec@@ ted , always full of vitality and full of desires ; the earth is only one of its stations , it will eventually extend to the vast star@@ ry sky . &quot;
therefore , we study the sun in order to better understand our living environment in the cos@@ mos and the influences it cast upon us .
of myri@@ ads of stars , the sun is merely an ordinary one , but also the closest one to us .
only by understanding the sun can we gain more knowledge of the boundless and mysterious cos@@ mos .
thank you !
hi , everyone !
I &apos;m Jin Pe@@ ida , a composer .
or you can call me a sound worker because today we &apos;re talking about the charm of sound .
music is also a type of sound .
just like there was music when I was walking out .
you heard the music before seeing me and then you had this idea in your mind , thinking what this person might look like , right ?
I personally think that the vi@@ be of that music did not suit me well .
it was too chill while I &apos;m a bit dramatic , as you could tell from the way I came on stage .
so shall we do it again ?
as we &apos;re going to talk about something in depth .
I believe we need some sort of in @-@ depth music to introduce me onto the stage .
so when you hear the music .
just go with your first reaction and do whatever you want .
OK ?
let &apos;s do it again .
hi , everyone !
I &apos;m Jin Pe@@ ida .
when you heard the music , I believe you would assume that this person must be over 80 years old .
he could be someone with profound knowledge and rich life experience .
he must have something serious to say .
well , that is not all about me .
I am definitely not young anymore .
but I &apos;m still energetic inside .
so I think I need to do this again , with energy this time .
still .
you should go with your first reaction .
let &apos;s do it again .
thank you !
thank you !
ha@@ ha !
I &apos;m Jin Pe@@ ida .
now you &apos;ve witnessed the charm of sound after my three appearances .
that &apos;s it for today &apos;s talk .
thank you !
I &apos;m just joking .
I &apos;m a composer that some of you might know and some don &apos;t .
I &apos;ve participated in the production of many film sound@@ tracks .
if you haven &apos;t heard of my name .
that &apos;s because I work behind the scene .
we &apos;re talking about the charm of sound today .
I want to tell you that even though you might have never heard of my name before .
you might have heard about the movies that I have participated in .
for example , movies like F@@ ly Me To Pol@@ ar@@ is and Perhaps Love .
like , the theme song of Perhaps Love , Isab@@ ella .
then the movie Cold War .
there you can find the sound@@ tracks I composed .
lately I &apos;ve been working on some mus@@ icals .
I &apos;m a composer that can never get enough of it and likes to give everything a go .
there is one musical performed in Shanghai , called Jewish in Shanghai .
you know that right ?
we &apos;re talking about the charm of sound today .
to know the charm of sound .
we have to know what sound is first .
don &apos;t we ?
I looked it up online and discovered that sound is as a matter of fact a physical phenomenon .
it is a kind of oscillation .
at a certain frequency .
your ear@@ drum oscill@@ ates with sound .
then you hear a sound .
so it &apos;s basically a physical phenomenon .
from this point of view , I find it very un@@ attractive .
but it has a message delivery function .
a built @-@ in function of its own .
what does it mean ?
when you hear the sound of rain , you know it &apos;s raining .
when you hear something breaking .
you can sense that a certain physical ob@@ jet breaks .
it might be glass .
or something else .
but it is also an &quot; artificial &quot; physical phenomenon that delivers information .
what does it mean ?
human intelligence is marvelous .
we use different tones and syll@@ ables to form a logic .
with int@@ ents , we use these log@@ ics to convey the messages that we want to express .
there we have languages , well .
languages are also sound .
but what &apos;s more important is we also have music .
right ?
music is also sound .
it &apos;s like a sequential arrangement of sounds that conve@@ ys a message .
I work in the production of film sound@@ tracks .
over the past years , I have worked with many directors for film sound@@ tracks . I take advantage of different music .
of different arrangements of sounds , to help directors tell their stories .
why is there music in movies ?
life consists of human activities .
there are lines and it is fine to have no background music .
however , in movies .
it seems that it would be difficult to fully express ourselves if there were no music .
that &apos;s the reason why we usually need to play music in movies .
but to be honest .
there is no perfect answer to that question .
so next time when you watch a movie .
you could pay attention to what I &apos;ve said to you today .
then you would discover that your sentiments are actually controlled by the sound@@ track and the director .
so today I &apos;ll also talk to you about how music could create proper atmos@@ p@@ heres for the films and express the emotions of characters .
we have several commonly @-@ used techniques to do that .
first .
the technique to use atmospheric music .
what is atmospheric music ?
let us imagine a scene .
it is in the morning .
a man and a women are in a park .
they slowly appear in the camera .
one on the left and the other on the right .
moving towards the center .
they look at each other face to face .
without talking to each other .
we have no clues about their personal or cultural backgrounds .
there are just two people .
it doesn &apos;t matter if they are Chinese or not .
anyway we didn &apos;t officially introduce them .
without the music .
there is a mysterious atmosphere .
but I would like to tell you that I don &apos;t need the plot or specific details to describe the relationship between these two people .
I could tell you their relationship with something other than dialogues .
if I play some music that &apos;s really romantic .
they might be lovers , right ?
they might have been separated for a long time .
so they promised to meet in the morning to elope .
they met because they wanted to prepare for something crazy .
if I play some music that &apos;s really intense .
they might be fo@@ es .
right ?
one person could have owed the other one a lot of money .
ah , I finally caught you .
so there was the fierce look .
right ?
that are the atmospheric movie sound@@ tracks that I talked about .
as in movies , we can &apos;t really always explain everything with plain lines .
especially for the second scene just now , I couldn &apos;t just put sub@@ titles here and there saying this is the good guy , that is the bad guy and here they meet , right ?
therefore , I think , for film scores composition or compos@@ ers .
these show the occasion where film scores could demonstrate to the fullness of their effects and artistic achievements .
for they could illustrate the lines and scenes that are un@@ written with music .
that is atmospheric sound@@ tracks .
here is another example .
it &apos;s about a black and white movie released in the 1960s .
the director is called H@@ itch@@ cock .
in Hong Kong , he is known as &quot; the Master of M@@ yst@@ ery and Sus@@ pense . &quot;
many of his works are filled with suspense and deduction .
in the scene you &apos;re about to see .
there is only one person driving .
although there are no dialogues .
you could read her emotions when the music comes in .
what that scenes tries to tell you is that this woman has stolen some money from her company and as she was ready to flee .
she saw her employer walking past her at the crossroads .
now you see ...
what do you see here ?
a woman driving .
right ?
music here is the over@@ tone that tells you the anxiety and sense of guilt the woman felt .
this is far different from the music we play while we drive , right ?
then the second point .
there are often different types of music in one movie .
we use the general background music to tell the audience what the scene is about .
either it is an action scene , a romantic one , a fight scene or an objec@@ ti@@ f plot etc .
the music actually creates an atmosphere .
but sometimes music could go beyond the scene and bears the marks of one specific character .
I &apos;ll give you one example .
one student was preparing for his studies abroad .
he finally got his offer and was going to Japan next month to live there for three years .
he was extremely happy as it was mentioned earlier in the movie that he had tried really hard to get the offer .
so when he went back home and opened the door .
he said , &quot; Mom , I pulled it off ! I &apos;m going to Japan next month ! I &apos;m going to study there ! &quot;
so they were happy and then came the music .
it makes a lot sense here because that happy music belongs to him .
in this story , as the son was ec@@ static .
his mother felt the same way .
however , at the same time , she could imagine that she couldn &apos;t see him for the next three years .
so , deep down inside her heart .
she had a very mixed feeling .
therefore , the director and I could choose some sad music .
why ?
because we want to show the audience that the sound@@ track of this scene is composed from the perspective of the mother .
so , at that moment , we hoped that the audience could feel the concern or even disappointment of the mother instead of the excitement of the son .
the point is that the mother was upset that she couldn &apos;t see her son for a very long time .
but , of course , we wouldn &apos;t tell you directly in the movie based on which point we choose the background music .
right ?
but when you hear the music and see the scene .
you could then res@@ onate with the mother and know how she feels .
there is another example for you .
I did the scene almost 20 years ago , back in 1999 in the last century .
it was an opening scene for a movie called Pur@@ ple Storm .
this part is bit long and I &apos;ll make it short .
it is a classic Hongkong action movie that features some international vi@@ bes ， with all those terrorists , chemical weapons and so on .
at the beginning of movie , the scene was about a country located in Southeast Asia .
some people were getting ready to board the ship and travel to western world to learn some new technologies .
they were terrorists who wanted to rev@@ amp the country .
so in this scene .
the moment when the leading characters boarded the ship , you could hear a music of around 20 or 30 seconds .
when I discussed this scene with the director Mr. Chen Des@@ en .
we used some alternative music .
they told me what the preceding music was like .
and then he played some sad music .
so , while this young terrorist @-@ to @-@ be was getting on the ship .
a piece of sad music was played and it worked out well .
look at him .
but something doesn &apos;t feel quite right .
why is that ?
in the end of the movie , this terrorist went back 19 years later after having been through something in Hongkong .
of course , in the end , he failed .
so he didn &apos;t end well .
as the world has changed already .
after 19 years , there is only him holding on to the mission and dream .
he is still determined to realize the dream .
he is a sort of tragic hero .
right ?
the music that was played when he boarded the ship might sound right .
but I didn &apos;t feel so .
why not ?
for whose point are we playing the sad music ?
whose perspective ?
the perspective of the director .
he created the character and he knows how he ended .
right ?
but for the hero .
when he left the country , he took with him a glorious mission .
so the moment he boarded the ship .
the prou@@ der he felt , the more tragic his ending would be .
we &apos;ll have a look .
this is how he ended .
ha@@ ha@@ ha .
he left with a mission ,
right ?
we didn &apos;t know his ending yet and we would go through this with him .
the prou@@ der he felt when he left .
the more tragic his ending would be .
so , this is the scene about a du@@ el in a sewage underground 19 years later .
let &apos;s see what happened .
in general , in the action movies .
bad guys are bad .
but in this scene , actually everyone has an ideal .
19 years later , his plan was sabot@@ aged .
at his last moment .
he saw something purple dripping down from the sky .
and somehow he felt that the dream that he had been waiting for 19 years were realized .
why some movies are easy to be forgotten ? especially the action movies .
some could leave people with impressions , for no matter what kind of characters they present .
the characters are real .
another thing is imagination .
what about imagination ?
we tend to think about musical instruments when speaking of imagination .
why is that ?
because different instruments could trigger different imag@@ inations .
what does that mean ?
here is an example .
the pi@@ an@@ os .
when talking about pi@@ an@@ os .
we generally think that they are elegant .
right ?
it is something about your education and cultivation .
when you play a piano , you &apos;ve got to have that vi@@ be .
right ?
as for guit@@ ars .
they reminds us of grassroots or in@@ die pop style .
boys in college would play guitar and several girls would be standing nearby mes@@ mer@@ ized .
this happens in our daily life .
so , every instrument is associated with something .
so this is one of the techniques we often use to compose film scores .
we rely on musical instruments to expand our scope of imagination and to interpret the underlying meanings and background of the movies .
we can see another example .
this movie was produced 20 years ago and it tells a story of a missi@@ onary who climbed the mountains for three days to preach in a tribe where people might kill him .
let &apos;s see what he did .
alright .
we don &apos;t have to go through all of it .
we will see what instrument he uses .
do you recognize it ?
ob@@ oe .
right .
ob@@ oe .
so you may wonder why he used this instrument .
why not other instruments ?
what about other instruments , say .
piano ?
it seems a little bit inconvenient to carry , ha@@ ha@@ ha .
the ob@@ oe gives an artistic vi@@ be .
doesn &apos;t it ?
it represents not only a tone but also the western culture .
when the missi@@ onary went to the tribe , he brought people there not only the religion .
but also the culture , arts and history of the western world .
all of which are easy to carry with him .
so , even though sometimes we might not speak the same language .
we can often find the common grounds in music and in sound .
so in movies we use different music instruments .
you can pay attention next time when you go to a movie .
to see what instruments the director chooses , which is a hint about the atmosphere of the movie .
the last technique is contrast .
in arts of any given time , contrast is paramount .
only when you are in a quiet environment could you know what lou@@ dness sounds like .
right ?
you see many of the scenes of American action movies nowadays are filled with loud music from the beginning to the end .
that makes people feel less certain of the emotions expressed there .
so we need contrast , which is also one of our common composition techniques .
in music , it is about the alter@@ nations of instruments , sound volume , or pit@@ ches .
all of the aforementioned techniques could let the audience relate to the emotions of the characters , which could not be achieved by lines .
we just talked about the charm of sound .
sometimes I &apos;ve been thinking what the most beautiful sound in the world is .
as we were just talking about the charm of sound .
I think there are mainly three most beautiful sounds in the world .
what is the third most beautiful sound ?
the heartbeat .
is it the only beautiful sound in the world ?
not really .
what is the sound of heartbeat ?
what is the second most beautiful sound ?
let &apos;s hear it .
it &apos;s the sound of love .
when you hear children saying &quot; Pap@@ a , &quot; &quot; Mama . &quot;
or when you hear people say &quot; I miss you . &quot;
or when you es@@ p@@ ouse or your loved one says &quot; I love you . &quot;
no matter what religion you believe in .
when you choose to believe in those words .
when you would sacrifice unconditionally .
the sound of these words could be a song in your ears .
it is the second most beautiful sound in the world .
of course , we will have to see what the most beautiful sound in the world is .
John C@@ age , an American composer living in last century , wrote a piece called Four Min@@ utes and Thir@@ ty @-@ Three Sec@@ onds .
all kinds of musical instruments could play this music .
here is the score , with three movements .
in the middle there is a word &quot; tac@@ et . &quot;
what does tac@@ et mean ?
tac@@ et means &quot; Don &apos;t Play . &quot;
if you watch the solo piano version of this music work .
you would see a pianist open the lid of the piano and sit there for four minutes and thirty @-@ three seconds , the he would close the lid .
why did John C@@ age come up with something so strange ?
what he wants to tell you is that except for the man @-@ made sounds .
the well @-@ rehear@@ sed beautiful ch@@ ords .
music is in the air and surrounds us .
he hopes that we could close our ears and feel the world surrounds us .
it is filled with music .
it &apos;s more than just a piece of music .
it has philosophy in it .
so I &apos;m telling you that actually the most beautiful sound in the world , especially in our time , is silence .
just now , I mentioned contrast .
in sound@@ tracks , there is also contrast .
it is the same with sound and it is the same with our life .
you will never appreciate the value of the happiness if you have never been through bitterness , loneliness or some unhappiness .
John C@@ age &apos;s Four Min@@ utes and Thir@@ ty @-@ Three Sec@@ onds intends to bring us back to the clean@@ est place inside our heart .
a quiet place .
when you immer@@ se yourself in that silence .
you can then hear the most important sound of your life in this beautiful sound .
your heart .
that &apos;s the charm of sound .
sound itself is char@@ m@@ less .
when we have a life , dreams , hopes , rich emotions and pursuits .
we will need more to express how we feel and thus come along the language and the music .
that &apos;s the charm of music and sound .
I &apos;m here very grateful for you for having spent the past 20 minutes or so hearing the sound I brought with me tonight .
you might find my words confusing .
but I believe that maybe one day or one night several years later , when you experience something and a piece of music you hear could give you some motiv@@ ations and encour@@ ag@@ ements or even some inspir@@ ations .
some un@@ solved questions may have their answers thanks to a song or a word .
maybe then you would think of me .
someone that shared with you some revel@@ ations for over 20 minutes at one night several years ago .
you might think of one words of mine tonight , or a certain note , maybe then you could truly feel the charm of sound .
thank you !
I am Li G@@ eng from the National Astr@@ onom@@ ical Observ@@ atories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences .
when it comes to astronomy , I want to share with you the human exploration of space , because I myself study the history of astronomy .
well , first of all you may wonder what exactly is astronomy .
the first things that spring to our mind may include advanced words such as the inter@@ stellar travel , time travel and aliens .
but what I want to share with you today may be not as advanced as the words mentioned earlier .
of course , I &apos;m not saying the work of astronomers is not advanced .
actually , what I want to share is that astronomy is not far away from us .
an old Chinese saying goes like this , &quot; People before the first three dynasties all know about astronomy . &quot;
but what does this mean ?
it means , in the distant past .
for example in er@@ as before the three earliest dynasties of Xia , Shang and Zhou , almost everyone knows a thing or two about astronomy .
this is to say , astronomy is closely related to our daily life .
you may feel the photos are actually very far away from us , and they are a rare sight in our daily life .
all of us can come and sit here today . but why ?
because we have an advertisement saying that there will be a performance at the Huang@@ pu The@@ ater in Shanghai at 3 pm , on June 3 , 20@@ 18 .
OK , so we all gather here today .
the ad tells us the date and the time , which is 3 pm of June 3 , as well as the location .
it &apos;s the time and space that bring us here at the studio .
the concepts of time and space are actually derived from astronomy .
a good example is the Chinese word Yu@@ zhou , or universe in English .
well , according to ancient Chinese , Yu refers to the space between the heaven and the earth , and the four locations of east , south , west , and north and Zhou refers to the time spanning from the ancient times to the present time , right ?
so the word Yu@@ zhou is originally a concept of time and space .
therefore , the concepts of date , time , or space are actually closely related to astronomy .
taking a more concrete example , in terms of time , we have a lot of instruments to keep track of the time in ancient China .
now we tend to depend on our mobile phones , watches or TV to keep track of the time , and to know what exactly the time is .
but over the course of several thousand years , ancient people live in an era without mobile phones or watches .
how do they keep track of the time ?
actually , ancient Chinese have made many innovations .
for example , when they keep track of the time through astronomical observations , they try to record the time on the ground .
the following picture is a water @-@ powered astronomical clock tower designed by a Chinese astronom@@ er in the Northern Song Dynasty spanning from 9@@ 60 to 1@@ 127 .
powered by the water , the clock tower runs evenly and steadily , driving the huge water wheel to movement , and making the time evenly flow on the ground .
at the same time , we need a time transfer system , through which the time is transmitted to us , and we can keep track of what time it is now .
actually , our current time transfer system is not much different from ancient ones .
but with the Internet and various new , advanced technologies .
our mobile phones keep real @-@ time and back@@ stage time synchronization , so that we can know exactly where the earth is now .
in addition to time , another important thing is the calendar .
to be more precise , the calendar refers to the date and the month .
so what &apos;s the basis of our calendar ?
it is based on rotation of the earth around the solar system .
for example , we often say that there are 3@@ 65 days in a year .
it &apos;s because it takes about 36@@ 5.@@ 24@@ 25 days for the earth to revol@@ ve around the sun for a round .
every four years , there is one more day , that is 3@@ 66 days in a year , so this is basically consistent with the the earth &apos;s period of revolution .
similarly , there are 29 days or 30 days in a month because it takes about 29.@@ 5 days for the moon to revol@@ ve around the earth for a round .
this is very easy to understand .
in fact , in ancient times , people have learned to master the rules of the time and the calendar through astronomical observations .
for example , look at this wall .
this is recovered from the wall which was constructed in the Ta@@ os@@ i era between 2@@ 300 and 2@@ 500 BC . through the wall , ancient people observe the horizontal az@@ im@@ u@@ th to determine the date .
actually , each day , the sun rises above the horizon from different positions .
you &apos;ll find out the rule as long as you observe it each day in the same place .
by constructing such walls and sl@@ its , people can know roughly the date when the sun penetr@@ ates through this slit or when it comes out through that one .
this is actually a horizontal calendar .
so in ancient times , the time and the calendar remain very important areas of work for astronomers .
at that time , the astronomical institution was the Directorate of Astr@@ onomy , or Qin Tian@@ jian .
it is ranked eighth out of 18 @-@ level titles in ancient times , or the equivalent of the bureau level in the present time .
it probably enjoys the same status as the National Astr@@ onom@@ ical Observ@@ atories , but it is endowed with much more power in ancient times .
why ?
because at that time , the relationship between astronomy and politics is inter@@ woven .
for example , for the emperor , Qin Tian@@ jian serves three important functions .
firstly , it is responsible for astronomical observation and timing .
just as what I said earlier , the purpose of astronomical observation is to devise the calendar and roll it out to the country .
this is a very important job of Qin Tian@@ jian .
the second task is to conduct astronomical observation .
for example , the officials in Qin Tian@@ jian has to keep a record of the movement of stars .
apart from astronomical observation and timing , Qin Tian@@ jian is also t@@ asked with performing div@@ ination . astronomers normally don &apos;t engage in this activity now .
when the emperor plans to hold important state activities , or for example , to choose a site for a new building .
he would send astronomers of Qin Tian@@ jian to survey potential venues and determine whether the places are suitable or not .
so compared with modern astronomical institutions , Qin Tian@@ jian serves much more functions .
it is not a purely scientific institution .
if you often watch costume dramas , you may find officials of the Qin Tian@@ jian are mentioned sometimes .
in the Ming and Qing Dynasties , the officials actually work on the Tian@@ anmen Square .
of course , the affiliation to the Qin Tian@@ jian is Beijing Ancient Observatory .
in the observ@@ atory , there are several large @-@ scale astronomical instruments dated back to the Qing Dynasty .
we can conduct astronomical observation with these astronomical instruments .
what comes to your mind first if you want to do astronomical observation now ?
it must be teles@@ copes , right ?
astronomers have now designed many large @-@ scale teles@@ copes , but it wasn &apos;t until in 16@@ 09 that the telescope was invented and used for astronomical observations .
before that time , over the course of several thousand years , human beings do not have teles@@ copes .
however , if we observe the stars only with our naked eyes , we can see more than 6,000 stars in a single day .
well , this number is already impressive .
but you may say &quot; Why can &apos;t we see them in our daily life ? &quot;
well , first of all , you have to find a very , very dark place and carefully observe the stars .
and with a long time of experience , you &apos;ll can see increasingly more stars .
so what do ancient people observe with the astronomical instruments ?
with the instruments , they have actually determined and recorded the position of the stars .
just as there are a long@@ itude and a latitude in the earth map , we assign each star a long@@ itude and a latitude , so that we know where the star is .
this is exactly what officials of the Qin Tian@@ jian have done .
after these observations , they would normally make some star maps and star cat@@ alogues .
with all the records , the ancient astronomers have made a lot of very important contributions .
ah , we often say that the ancient Chinese astronomers have kept a detailed record of astronomical observations .
for example , the photo I am zo@@ oming in now is the Cra@@ b Ne@@ bula .
of course , this photo was taken by the Hu@@ bble Space Tel@@ es@@ cope , and we can see its structure very clearly .
so how is the Cra@@ b Ne@@ bula formed ?
it is formed out of a massive star , which explo@@ des at the end of its evolution , and creates such a super@@ nov@@ a remnant .
with the telescope , we can see clearly that the fibr@@ ous structure of the ne@@ bula is constantly expanding outward with speed .
in 19@@ 28 , the famous American astronom@@ er Hu@@ bble observed the outward expansion of the Cra@@ b Ne@@ bula through astronomical observation .
after he made the calculation , he found that if the crab ne@@ bula had kept explo@@ ding , it was probably the relics of a star which exploded more than 900 years ago .
but we find , as early as more than 900 years ago in the Song Dynasty , such a record in many historical documents such as The History of the Song Dynasty and Song Hui@@ y@@ ao jig@@ ao or Song Government Man@@ us@@ cript Com@@ pen@@ dium .
ancient Chinese call the Cra@@ b Ne@@ bu@@ a K@@ e Xing , or the Gu@@ est Star , meaning a star which suddenly occurs somewhere and becomes invisible again after some time .
usually , such a star cannot be seen at all , but at this very time it appears suddenly , as bright as Venus and even visible during the day .
it is there for two years and its color keeps changing .
during that time , officials of the Qin Tianjin conduct many observations and keep many valuable records .
although the US observed the star and unveiled many details with the world &apos;s most advanced observation equipment .
the wisdom of ancient Chinese , including the observations we have made over the several thousand years is a feat that Americans cannot compete with .
apart from that , the records have other uses .
for example , this star map , called Dun@@ huang Star map , is now housed in the British Library .
this map is the oldest existing star map in the world .
from the map , we can see that ancient Chinese divide the heaven or sky into different parts .
in the first picture , there is a projection of the Pur@@ ple For@@ bidden enclosure .
and in the latter pictures , the sky is divided into different segments based on the position of the eclip@@ tic and the equator , and then there are descriptions about the stars .
of course , it &apos;s not only the scattered stars that we see in the sky .
ancient Chinese would connect these stars into different outlines or patterns and as we all know , the patterns represent the constellation .
in modern times , we often adopt the categor@@ ization of the const@@ ell@@ ations of ancient Greece , which divides the whole day into 88 const@@ ell@@ ations .
ah , these const@@ ell@@ ations are often used in fortune telling , for example , calculating what sign you were born under , and predicting whether two people have incompatible qualities or personalities .
well , this is what western astro@@ logy does .
there is also astro@@ logy in ancient China , but our system is a little bit different from the Western one .
our constellation system is called S@@ any@@ uan , or Three En@@ closures , and Er@@ shi@@ ba Xi@@ u , or the Twenty @-@ eight Man@@ sions .
just like the Western system , we also divide the sky into different segments and assign them different meanings , except that they are not named after animals .
for example , in our system , there are the For@@ bidden City , the cities , and the communication between the heaven and the earth .
for ancient Chinese , this heaven @-@ earth communication symbolizes the harmonious relationship between the heaven and man .
that is , whatever exists in the heaven should exist on the earth .
therefore , we have to project all these things on the earth into the sky , to make sure there are also markets , officials , and various other events in the heaven .
if abnormal phenomena are spotted in the sky , such as the unusual positions of stars , and the appearance of com@@ ets , the ancient people will think something important will happen .
this is an important foundation for the ancient Chinese astro@@ logy which is reserved for the country and the emperor .
when it comes to ancient Chinese astronomy .
we may feel that it contains many feud@@ alistic , out @-@ dated , supersti@@ tious things and it is quite different from modern sciences .
in fact , this is only part of the story .
for example , in the Northern Song Dynasty , this star map is the earliest attempt towards the modern scientific star map in human history .
later on in the Southern Song Dynasty , the star map was carved into this stone , and now it is stored in Suzhou , also called the Suzhou Astr@@ o Stone .
there are more than 1,300 stars engraved in the stone , and they are marked out according to their corresponding positions in the sky and their relative positions with each other .
we can say it is a also very interesting stuff .
well , when we study the history of Chinese science and technology , a person is well @-@ known , who is Joseph Ne@@ ed@@ ham , a famous British historian known for his scientific research and writing on the history of Chinese science and technology .
Joseph Ne@@ ed@@ ham proposed a question called &quot; The Ne@@ ed@@ ham Question . &quot;
he is British , but he travels to China for the sake of China &apos;s history of science and technology .
in the end , he writes the big @-@ tom@@ ed seven @-@ volume Science and Civ@@ il@@ isation in China .
the question Joseph Ne@@ ed@@ ham raised is .
why had China been overtaken by the West in modern science and technology , despite its earlier successes ?
well , at first sight , this question makes a lot of sense , so many scientific and technological historians have done research on it for decades .
but if we give it a second thought now , we will find we don &apos;t have to take this problem too seriously .
because Joseph Ne@@ ed@@ ham still takes a Western @-@ centr@@ ism view to consider this .
sometimes if we think more about it , and if we look at science from the perspective of civilization .
we will know that modern science is only a few hundred years old , but the human civilization enjoys a history of tens of thousands of years .
over the thousands of years without science , humans can still survive .
so in fact , science is just a way of understanding nature .
therefore , when we look at the ancient Chinese astronomy .
we may place more emphasis on its cultural aspects , such as our culture and traditions .
these things may be more important , although it also offers some help for modern science .
well , this picture is the LA@@ MO@@ ST located in Xing@@ long Observatory of the National Astr@@ onom@@ ical Observ@@ atories , Hebei Province .
it is one of the large optical teles@@ copes we build in the 21st century and it is also the largest optical observ@@ atory in the Far East .
well , with the LA@@ MO@@ ST , I want to share with the sets of data that humans collect in space exploration .
Sh@@ ishi Xing@@ jing , the earliest star catalog in China , records the information of 121 stars , including their locations .
in ancient Greece , there is the H@@ ip@@ par@@ ch@@ us Star Cat@@ alog .
of course , it is a little bit younger than ours , and it has recorded 10@@ 22 stars .
since the appearance of the first telescope in 16@@ 09 , our horizons have been greatly expanded .
we can see weak and dark astronomical objects .
in early 19th century , the Bes@@ sel Star Cat@@ alog already had information about 50,000 stars .
by the early twentieth century , the Dre@@ i@@ ber Star Cat@@ alog had recorded 400,000 stars , and the data was much more accurate than before because of the new astronomical reference system .
this 1997 Ty@@ co @-@ 1 Cat@@ alog recorded data of 1.@@ 05 million stars .
our LA@@ MO@@ ST telescope can simultaneously observe the spectrum of nearly four thousand stars .
it has a detailed classification of the stars and is also an important &quot; sky @-@ hunting plan &quot; initiative .
as of June 20@@ 17 , the LA@@ MO@@ ST telescope has observed the spectrum of nine million stars , and it has recorded 4.@@ 92 million sets of data .
you may think that compared with the ancient astronomy .
we have actually made huge strides over the past several hundred years .
we already have access to the data of nearly nine million stars .
is it quite impressive ?
then I want to share with you another set of data .
how many stars are there in our galaxy ?
there are roughly 100 billion stars .
and how many galaxies like the Milky Way are there in the universe ?
at least 100 billion galaxies .
so our exploration of the universe is still at its initial stage .
we are still making a lot of very helpful attempts .
for example , the F@@ AST telescope , also of the National Astr@@ onom@@ ical Observ@@ atories , is now the world &apos;s largest single @-@ caliber radio telescope .
with an astonishing diameter of 500 meters , its resolution is also very high .
with the F@@ AST telescope , I would like to quote a comment from Zhang H@@ eng &apos;s Ling Xian .
&quot; the past is known or unknown . the universe is known or unknown . the universe is infinite and boundless . &quot;
what it tells us is that when we explore the unknown world , there are still many things in the universe waiting for us to explore .
in fact , ancient Chinese have long wanted to know what the universe is like .
we astronomers now are doing our best to explain some of the same problems plagu@@ ing the ancient people .
human beings are very small in the universe , and too many things are still unknown to us whether it is our own history or our time and space .
the last picture is called P@@ ale Blue D@@ ot .
many children may have heard of it .
the picture is initiated and taken by Carl S@@ agan , a famous astronom@@ er .
on February 14 , 1990 , when V@@ oy@@ ager 1 flew to as far as nearly the edge of the solar system for a very long distance , NASA , or the National Aer@@ onau@@ tics and Space Administration , ordered it to go back and take a group of photos of the solar system .
this is what we call the Family Por@@ trait .
we can find in this photo our planet earth , which is marked in blue circle on the map .
ah , you can see this is our detector .
from a very distant spot , or not so distant , when we view our earth from the universe .
we can see we human beings , our history , our religion , the people we love and the places we live in all live on such a small dot .
there is such a vast and infinite space in the universe waiting for us to explore .
in fact , what we don &apos;t know is much more than what we know .
I was formerly a football player .
a special chance made me part of a mountain@@ eering team .
actually , a free physical examination was the reason to join the selection .
unexpectedly , I was chosen at last .
1975 was the year when Chinese mountain@@ eering team climbed Mount Everest for the second time .
we all excited at that time as it was a political mission issued by the prime minister , which was totally different from the concept of &quot; mountain @-@ climbing &quot; now .
moreover , comparing the conditions in 1975 with that of now , both in terms of equipment and weather forecast are greatly divergent .
in other words , mountain @-@ climbing then indicated harsh conditions .
I was assigned to the group of challenging the peak .
we made a few attempts , but due to inaccurate weather forecast , we failed as a result of strong wind .
we had four sources of weather forecasts .
specifically CCTV , Lhasa Meteorological Station , Chengdu Meteorological Station and our own meteorological group .
however four sources made us confused about which was the right to listen to .
finally , we relied on veteran members . according to their experience , we mountain@@ e@@ ered on days with relatively good weather .
for the last time we reached 8,@@ 6@@ 00m and encountered strong upper wind again .
as a result , we stayed there for two days and three nights , running out all our goods including food and fuel .
the only choice was to retreat .
at the night back to the height of 7,@@ 6@@ 00m .
I gave my sleeping bag to one of my teammates , who lost his one because he was worn out .
at that time , I had a nickname &quot; Lord of Fire , &quot; which literally means I was cold @-@ resistant .
so I didn &apos;t hesitate to give him my sleeping bag but I froze my feet off .
well , you can see how my feet are now .
I lost my feet and sh@@ ins in my tw@@ enties .
that is to say , I would spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair .
at that time , I was in great sorrow and even lost confidence in my future life .
I didn &apos;t know what to do in the future .
fortunately , I met a foreign pros@@ thetic expert , who came to China to introduce relevant technique .
after checking my conditions , he told me that with artificial limbs , I could live a normal life and even climb mountains again .
in that way , climbing Mount Everest one more time had become a dream , or a goal for me .
for more than 40 years , I have been struggling for this goal .
I got cancer and then throm@@ bus .
I would die at any time due to diseases such as cerebral thro@@ mb@@ osis and myocardial infarction .
despite that , I never gave up .
in my mind , only if I live will I strive for my dream .
so I didn &apos;t think too much about my diseases and just followed my training plan .
I had cancer in 1996 and throm@@ bus in 20@@ 16 .
when I got throm@@ bus , the doctor warned me not to climb mountains considering the col@@ dness , lack of oxygen and the squeeze of artificial limbs .
he said that more climbing would lead to highly possible relapse of throm@@ bus , which threatened my life at any time .
personally , we should believe what the doctor said , but not absolutely .
I should still pursue my dream .
2011 welcomed in Italy the first Par@@ ac@@ lim@@ bing World Championships .
it is commonly known that rock climbing is a highly difficult sport for young people .
however , I was 62 in 2011 and didn &apos;t have any relevant experience before .
my leader said that for years of efforts , I kept good strength and shape .
as participation out@@ weighed victory , he encouraged me to have a try , which served as a pioneer experience for our country in this field and collected more information about it .
to this end , I took part in the competition with an attitude of learning from young people .
beyond my expectation was that in my group , I was the winner for both gold medals of difficulty and speed .
thank you .
it inspired me that only attempts or trials for everything can you find your own value .
after that , in 20@@ 14 , when climbing Mount Everest , I had following thoughts .
firstly , I have tried to better adapt to climb with artificial limbs .
the second was to find out how these limbs can better suit mountain @-@ climbing .
next was a test .
because I hadn &apos;t climbed high mountains for decades .
it was necessary to test whether I could do that or not .
well , ahead of that , I climbed Ro@@ bu@@ che Mountain , which was of more than 6,000 meters and in Nepal .
I felt well after the test .
however , when I arrived at the base camp and prepared to climb the peak , an aval@@ anche hit us and killed 16 Sher@@ pa guides .
it was the biggest disaster in Nepal &apos;s mountain@@ eering history .
as a result , the Nep@@ alese government canceled all the climbing activities to Mount Everest afterwards .
my trip was no exception .
next year witnessed my third climbing to Mount Everest .
similarly , Island Peak of over 6,000 meters was my destination before that .
the Island Peak is lower than Mount Everest , but has similar climate and environment .
in addition , it is close to Mount Everest with a one @-@ day walk .
during my trip , the guide told me that all the potential climbers to Mount Everest would choose Ro@@ bu@@ che Mountain or Island Peak for a previous field training .
after that , the guide could judge whether one was suitable to climb Mount Everest or at what height could one reach .
if not , he would advise you not to go .
after my trip to Peak Island , my guide said to me that .
if weather permitted , he would certainly accompany me to the peak and back to my country in safety .
I was glad to hear that and thought years of exercise was not in vain .
however , when I prepared to climb the peak at base camp , a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ century earthquake in Nepal happened , which had a magnitude of 8.1 .
just before the meal time , I felt the shake , then ran out of the tent and heard the sound of &quot; boom &quot; which was similar to thunder .
earthquakes , aval@@ an@@ ches and ic@@ ef@@ all will naturally start with such sound , similarly a rum@@ ble of thunder .
then you can see , or more precisely , if ever see , the snow will rush down .
not at every place with aval@@ anche can you see such scene .
my case was that after the thunder I heard when getting out of the tent , at the same time , right ahead of me was the shock wave just like the explosion of an atomic bomb , rolling over towards us .
I was excited to see such a scene that was normally in a movie rather than in reality .
so I wanted to use my cell phone to take a picture .
before I picked up the phone , the shock wave had arrived in front of me , which scared me to leap into my tent .
I held tight a tent pole and bent over , waiting for the death .
the idea that I was doomed to die buz@@ zed in my head .
when the aval@@ anche came to tear down the tent and buried us , the death was a certain thing then .
hence I made no move and bent over , bearing no extra thinking but waiting for death .
one minute later , the world around turned quiet .
totally no sound at all .
then I took a look out of the tent .
previously surrounding us were mountains of seven or eight thousand meters .
now all buried in endless whit@@ eness .
nothing was in our range of vision except torn tents in front of ours .
actually , the base camp was built right on the K@@ hum@@ bu Gl@@ ac@@ ier , which was en@@ circled by high mountains of seven or eight kilometers .
down the mountains was the valley and up the valley was the glacier .
more accurately , this glacier was like an island , higher than the valley .
what aval@@ anche and ic@@ ef@@ all brought about rushed down into the valley and then up towards us .
those tents and camps first suffered the shock wave were rolled up or hit by stones and ice blocks .
the death toll was 28 .
how about our tent ?
luckily , the shock wave came to an end as approaching us .
so my tent was blown as@@ ke@@ w instead of being blown down .
I survived .
thank you for your applause .
after that , I still held the idea that as long as I lived .
I would fight for my dream and climb again .
the fourth climbing was in 20@@ 16 .
I had a relatively good result to reach the height of 8,@@ 7@@ 50@@ m , only 94 meters away from the peak .
you can imagine how difficult it was to climb with artificial limbs .
first of all , where was I stepping on ?
was it even or not ?
were the rocks loose or not ?
all these remained unknown to me .
as the feeling passed to my waist could I know the answers .
however , in that case , my body would have been shaking a lot .
it means that I couldn &apos;t balance my body with feet .
naturally people with sound limbs like you audience , will feel immediately as you step on certain places and then balance with your ank@@ les quickly .
but it doesn &apos;t work for me .
I could just hold one al@@ pen@@ stock in each hand to keep balance .
the uph@@ ill and downhill angles are like this .
however , I could not move the ankle or adjust artificial limbs according to different angles .
what was the solution ?
I used the toe part uph@@ ill and heel part downhill .
it means that these limbs contact little with the mountain body .
it was very slippery indeed and I seemed to slide down with every step .
when stepping into ice and snow , especially the part that mixed with ice and snow , if it was soft , there was no great difficulty .
but in the case of sheer ice , only heavy kicks could send cr@@ amp@@ ons into the ice .
otherwise I would certainly slide down , down to a bottom@@ less ch@@ asm and with nowhere to find the body at all .
therefore , I kicked hard with every step .
the harder I kicked , the deeper the cr@@ amp@@ ons went into the ice .
common people can touch the ice with whole sol@@ es .
therefore , seven to eight cr@@ amp@@ ons can stick into the ice when they climb .
however , it is of no use to me .
I hope future technology advances can change such situation .
in the future , I hope to wear more sophisticated climbing shoes and artificial limbs specially for mountain @-@ climbing , which enables me to feel the ground as soon as I step on it .
well , it is a kind of wish , and I believe it will come true in the near future .
when I reached 8,@@ 750 at that time , I was overwhelmed by happiness .
I believed that I would succeed this time as I could reach the peak for only a little over one hour .
decades of struggles would finally pay off , which brought me more excitement .
but then suddenly came a strong upper wind with a snow@@ storm .
when climbing up to this height , not only me , all the climbers would choose to challenge the peak without hesitation .
all their money and time were preparations for this chance .
I was surely more eager as I was in my six@@ ties and had no feet .
in addition , the Nep@@ alese government issued a ban for those disabled on climbing Mount Everest .
as a result , I considered it as the last chance to climb this mountain , hence no difficulty could hinder me .
I had a total of five Sher@@ pa guides to protect me , two in front of me and three behind .
at that time , the front two looked at me and the back three also did that when I turned back .
my heart was broken .
they were all young people in their tw@@ enties , whose job was to help those had the same dream as me to reach the top of Mount Everest .
however , since they were at their prime in terms of career , I could not sacrifice others &quot; lives for my dream .
besides , I was clear of that such a strong snow@@ storm at this height was deadly .
the time you need to reach the top , your chances of fro@@ st@@ bite , your risks would multiply .
as a qualified clim@@ ber , I should advance bravely as well as give up timely .
that is what a good athlete would do .
as a result , I made the most difficult choice to retreat .
the decision was a heavy blow to me .
as I climbed up , the peak seemed to wave at me , which encouraged me a lot .
I was full of vigor uph@@ ill .
but when I made up my mind to retreat , I was totally defl@@ ated and exhausted .
when I finally approached the camp , lights were visibly flashing but I still could not arrive there .
I was worn out at that time .
for every step I took , if the ground was uneven .
I would fall over as physical balance was not in my control .
if I fell over , I might not want to , or more precisely , could not get up .
I had been walking for 24 hours then , a whole day .
if I did not get up , my Sher@@ pa guides would wait for me , so I should avoid that .
in fact , I could not stand up by myself , so they lent me a hand .
after another 24 hours , I arrived at my camp .
above all , my five guides had no major injuries , which offers comfort to me .
well , I learned afterwards that six people died at that height during my trip .
that is to say , in spite of the snow@@ storm , some climbers continued but never came back , or went missing halfway .
actually , I made a right decision to withdraw .
regret was a natural thing as I failed when so closely to the top .
as I recalled the trip now , I think regret is not a totally bad thing .
it inspired me to carry out my fifth trip towards Mount Everest .
last year , I challenged T@@ eng@@ ger Desert , the G@@ ob@@ i Desert and Yu@@ zhu Peak etc .
the training is to prepare to climb Mount Everest again this year .
it was a secret to others and I worked hard quietly .
I woke up at 4 o &apos;clock every morning to conduct strength training .
I practiced crou@@ ches with a 10 @-@ kil@@ o sand@@ bag to train my leg power , 150 times a group and 10 groups a day .
extra exercises include pull @-@ ups , 10 times a group and 10 groups a day along with .
push @-@ ups and sit @-@ ups , both for 60 times a group and 6 to 8 groups a day .
after all these exercises done , I would ride to Fr@@ ag@@ rance Hill , which was more than 20 kilometers away from my house .
then I came back and finished my fore@@ noon .
well , I used to go every other day , but changed to go every day .
my wife was aware of my secret training as I went every day and got up from 5 &quot; o clock to 4 o &apos;clock early in the morning ,
she guessed and asked whether I prepared to climb Mount Everest again .
I replied yes .
she disagreed and asked me to consult with the doctor .
I followed her advice .
then the doctor gave me a positive answer .
he said that although one blood vessel was blocked , a new one near it grew , thin but unob@@ struc@@ ted .
in addition , he gave me three more advice .
in the first place , keep warm in case of slower blood circulation due to col@@ dness .
next , drink more water to dilute blood , thus promoting blood circulation .
thirdly , keep in contact with him in case of emergencies at any time .
he also gave me some suggestions on medicine .
I accepted .
considering professional advice from the doctor , my wife finally agreed and bought me a bottle gour@@ d , in such a small size and silver color .
she opened it , wrote a few words &quot; Come back safely &quot; on a small piece of paper , and put the paper into it .
well , I &apos;ve been climbing mountains all my life .
you know climbing Mount Everest is especially dangerous as any unexpected situation will be a potential cause to death .
so every time before I set out .
I clearly told my wife when to pay the water and power bills , what insur@@ ances I had bought and all the passwords .
moreover , I promised it would be the last time to climb the Mount Everest .
I repeated these words every time before my trip and guaranteed to come back safely .
but not any time was the really last one .
fortunately , she understood my only hobby well .
so she preferred me to pursue my dream and leave no regrets .
she always supports me , not in terms of climbing Mount Everest .
but instead , all the efforts I made and the process of pursuing my dream .
she agreed at last .
bad news arrived before my trip .
I got to know that the Nep@@ alese government would implement a stricter ban on the disabled who wanted to climb Mount Everest from this year .
a head @-@ on blow indeed .
what happened later ?
we filed a lawsuit against the Nep@@ alese government and won .
being the prevailing party was a great joy .
that is to say , I have already cleared all the obstacles ahead of me .
on March 31st this year , I started my trip from Beijing .
the way to the top was not that difficult . I had figured out all the terrain features and potential difficulties .
then corresponding training was carried out previously .
despite hardness , preparations smoo@@ thed them away .
of course , there were unexpected incidents .
but finally I reached the top and realized my dream for more than forty years .
thank you very much .
on my way downhill , another snow@@ storm struck us and I got fro@@ st@@ bite .
look , here on my face still has a mark given by the fro@@ st@@ bite in May this year .
and on my finger is a black part , another similar cold injury caught in the snow@@ storm .
more dangerous situation was that when I went down the mountain .
my legs were too swollen to suit the artificial limbs .
in other words , these limbs would drop easily .
commonly limbs will function well and only when I push here will they part from my legs .
at that time , limbs which were not worn properly were like a piston in a car .
they parted a little when lifting legs and stuck with legs when stepping on the ground .
it was a deadly threat to me .
just when reaching the height of 7,@@ 9@@ 00m .
if I lost my artificial limbs , you can imagine , no one could save me .
I was so anxious .
so I took long jo@@ h@@ ns to shape like kne@@ elets and tightened trous@@ er legs , thus keeping the limbs at right place .
on the way downhill were many small cracks in the ice that were covered by the snow@@ storm .
there was another difficulty . on our glasses was not frost but ice inside .
the only method was to take off gloves and scrape the ice off to make sure the vision .
in that way , my hands had fro@@ st@@ bites quickly .
when going down the mountain .
we could see , but sometimes not clearly where the cracks were or whether there was any obstacle .
for several times I fell into the cracks with all my legs trapped , which scared me to death .
I could still feel my artificial limbs but didn &apos;t dare to move for the fear of totally falling into the cracks .
then I called my guides to dig the ice cracks and pulled out limbs with my hands .
well , that &apos;s it .
anyway , I came back safe and sound !
thank you .
I have finally fulfilled my dream for 40 years .
excitement was beyond words when I was at the foot of the mountain .
I even prepared to cry out to the whole world or made some special poses .
no matter how great plan I had , excitement disappeared as I went onto the mountain top .
the only idea was that I finally reached the peak , where I dreamed of stepping on for over 40 years .
but after a few words to my wife , I cried with great excitement .
I devoted all to achieving my dream . instead , I paid little attention to my family in my life .
therefore , since I had finished the goal , next priority was to accompany my wife and made up for the lost time .
how ?
my choice is a self @-@ driving tour for sightseeing with her .
well , it &apos;s also a hard thing for me .
we disabled can only rely on one hand instead of feet to control brake and accelerator .
actually I am always in a fl@@ urry .
what &apos;s more , I am used to riding a bicycle .
if I squeeze the brake , the by@@ c@@ icle will stop .
but it &apos;s not the case when driving a car because lifting the hand brake means speeding up .
as a result , when sensing the danger , I lifted the hand brake spontaneously but actually accelerated the car , leading to crashes into taxis for several times .
naturally the angry taxi driver would flare up at me .
it was absolutely my fault as I ran into his car .
nowadays , automatic pilot is not a new thing .
I would like to have a try if the chance permits , so as to enjoy more vibrant and pleasant driving .
thank you all .
this is a recent block@@ buster movie .
in which there is a super hero called the green giant H@@ ul@@ k .
whose real name is Bruce Ban@@ ner .
Bruce Ban@@ ner is one of the brightest world @-@ renowned nuclear physic@@ ists .
a lab accident exposed him to the gamma ray radiation released by his gamma bomb .
turning him into a super hero .
and Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts are also my research subject .
speaking of Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts , on August 17 last year , for the first time we humans heard from the gravitational wave and also saw in the gamma @-@ ray band the merger of two neutron stars .
it was an important event that drew widespread attention from scientists over the world .
well , now I &apos;d like to talk about how to find Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts .
in 1945 , the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Hiro@@ sh@@ ima and Nag@@ as@@ aki in a bid to end the World War II as soon as possible .
those atomic bombs were so powerful that each of them was equivalent to the total energy released by tens of thousands of tons of T@@ NT .
atomic bombs cause massive destruction to life through phot@@ othermal radiation , shock waves and gamma rays .
after that , the former Soviet Union and China conducted atomic bomb experiments and successfully developed atomic bombs .
in order to monitor the atomic bomb explosions carried out by the former Soviet Union and China , the United States specifically launched a satellite in 1967 .
as a result , the satellite detected a dozen such gamma rays .
however , analysis showed the Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts were not from the earth , but from the space .
and that &apos;s how we found Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts .
so it was not until 1973 that an article about Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts was first published by scientists .
well , then , what is GR@@ B ?
GR@@ B is a gamma @-@ ray flash in the space .
where does it occur ?
this is a GR@@ B .
we can see a surge in gamma flow in a certain space at a certain time .
a sufficiently sensitive satellite is able to detect 1 ~ 3 times of Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts every day .
this is the Galaxy .
if you observe the Galaxy with a telescope at a night with crisp air and no light pollution .
you will also see the shape .
most of the stars are disc @-@ alike .
so are the neutron stars distributed in the Galaxy .
it &apos;s easy to understand .
for neutron stars are resulted from collapsed massive stars .
well , this is a neutron star .
although like an egg , it &apos;s totally different from an egg .
its mass is 1.4 times the mass of the sun , and its size is equal to the size of a district in Shanghai .
its mass density , if being calculated , is rather high .
the density of neutron star matter per cubic centi@@ meter is equivalent to the sum of the total weight of 1.3 billion Chinese people , which is extremely high .
due to such a high density , significant phenomena can be observed on neutron stars .
and those phenomena can help us reveal the most fundamental laws of interaction in the space .
so it is precisely because neutron stars are so important that relevant researches have won the Nobel Prize in Physics for four times .
so this is a very important subject .
well , now there &apos;s a question .
how far are Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts ?
the distribution of Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts , as I said before , is highly is@@ otropic .
it proves that Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts occur in the cosm@@ ological distance , which is exceedingly far .
it will take the light at least hundreds of millions of years to travel the distance .
it is far@@ away , for the distance is set in the cosm@@ ological scale .
so , where are Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts located ?
the B@@ ep@@ po@@ SA@@ X satellite found the answer in 1997 .
after the B@@ ep@@ po@@ SA@@ X satellite located the GR@@ B .
the optical and radio teles@@ copes in the visible light band on the ground also located the GR@@ B .
in this way , its distance was determined .
therefore , the year of 1997 marked a watershed in researches on Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts .
now let &apos;s see the energy of Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts .
by calculation , you will find that the energy released by a GR@@ B in one second is equivalent to the total energy released by the sun in the whole 10 billion years .
wow !
tremendous Energy ! but to what extent ?
it amounts to the energy released by 3 times 10 to the power of 28 atomic bombs .
the energy released by a single atomic bomb is huge enough , let alone such an amount of them .
so , according to our knowledge .
GR@@ B &apos;s mechanism and formation process must be in extremes .
well , now I &apos;ll take you to explore its mechanism and formation process .
the first mechanism is the collapse of a massive star .
as said by Mr. Chen P@@ eng@@ fei , the sun is an ordinary star .
but if there is such a star with ten times the mass of the sun .
it will be completely different .
the sun &apos;s longevity is 10 billion years , so the longevity of the star with ten times the mass of the sun is 10 to the power of 7 years .
the star will finally collapse after all these years .
so what is the consequence ?
let &apos;s see it .
the star center collapses inward to form a black hole and maybe a neutron star .
the collapse process generates jet , which will penetrate the stellar envelope into the space .
if the jet burst towards the observer , then he can see a GR@@ B .
otherwise , he won &apos;t see anything .
now the question is , how to prove that the collapse of a massive star can result in a GR@@ B ?
we need to find some observ@@ ational evidences .
the workers from the environmental protection agency will know where the air pollution source is located from the components of the PM@@ 2.5 and PM@@ 10 in the air .
likewise , we need to survey the surrounding environment of the GR@@ B .
and my colleague and I found that it &apos;s a wind environment .
in other words , before the final collapse , the massive star let out massive substances , forming a wind environment .
it means that its mass density is in@@ vers@@ ely proportional to the square of this radius .
so , such an environment proves that the BR@@ B resulted from the collapse of a massive star .
this is only an indirect evidence , of course .
so what is the direct evidence ?
researchers discovered that the GR@@ B in March 29 , 2003 occurred in the same direction with a super@@ nov@@ a .
the final collapse of a massive star generates a super@@ nov@@ a .
therefore , the discovery was an evidence that the GR@@ B did result from the collapse of the massive star .
the second mechanism is called the merger of two neutron stars .
this was an idea put forward by P@@ ac@@ z@@ yn@@ ski in 1986 and has been proved by observations .
these are two neutron stars .
after hundreds of millions of years of evolution , the two neutron stars are about to merge .
the process of merger produces jet at a speed close to the speed of light .
that is , 300,000 kilometers per second .
mass e@@ jection also occurs .
the mass will synthesize a large number of gravity elements , which will then produce something called kil@@ on@@ ova .
a kil@@ on@@ ova is 10 to the power of 8 higher than the brightness of the sun .
on October 16 last year , at 10 : 00 a.m .
eastern Standard Time , many astronomical institutions and government organizations around the world held a press conference at the same time .
what were they about ?
well , they all focused on the gravitational wave caused by the merger of two neutron stars on August 17 last year .
on the same day dozens of articles on Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts were published .
this graph shows that the frequency of gravitational wave increases rapidly with time while its intensity accum@@ ulates .
gravitational wave and Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts may happen at the same time .
the sound of gravitational wave manifested by t@@ we@@ et goes up , and the GR@@ B is represented by a cl@@ ang .
now let &apos;s have a look at it .
well , it &apos;s a motion graph .
first , the L@@ IG@@ O captures the gravitational radiation .
we can hear the t@@ we@@ et .
and then the cl@@ ang .
it represents the GR@@ B .
in addition , people also saw a kil@@ on@@ ova 11 hours after the observation of GR@@ B .
as I said before , a kil@@ on@@ ova is much brighter than the sun .
if a kil@@ on@@ ova appears out of the sun , it will be our do@@ om@@ s@@ day .
this picture shows the observation of the kil@@ on@@ ova through several teles@@ copes in places such as Chile , Hawaii , South Africa and Australia .
the Antarctic telescope was set by the Pur@@ ple Mountain Observatory of China .
all these teles@@ copes captured the radiation of the kil@@ on@@ ova .
when Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts two neutron stars merge to produce the kil@@ on@@ ova , heavy elements are synthesized .
this is a periodic table of elements .
different colors of elements are synthesized by different physical processes of the celestial bodies .
among them , Gold , Plat@@ inum , Silver and even radioactive element Uran@@ ium were all synthesized by the merger of two neutron stars ,
so was the gold jewelry you wear .
then , what is produced by the merger of two neutron stars ?
my colleague and I hold an unusual opinion .
it is believed that a black hole might be the possible answer .
but we suppose that a neutron star with a bigger mass may emerge .
a neutron star is completely different from a black hole .
if a black hole appears , nothing will happen afterwards .
but a neutron star may give off radiation , like spitting bubbles .
sure enough , such kind of radiation can be inspected in 155 days after the G@@ W@@ 17@@ 08 .
proving that a massive neutron star may be possible .
I just mentioned two mechanisms raised by the international team .
one is the collapse of massive stars , and the other is the merger of two neutron stars .
the completely different mechanism put forward by my colleague and I is called &quot; phase change of two neutron stars . &quot;
as the mass of a neutron star continues to grow .
just like a person continues to gain weight as he eats more and more .
the star , not being able to bear its gravity , will collapse to a quar@@ k star .
which is composed of quar@@ k matter .
the quar@@ k star is smaller than the neutron star in size .
which means such a transformation will release enormous energy that further generates Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts .
it can be used to explain the observ@@ ational phenomena other models cannot explain .
that &apos;s our model .
well , there are two questions . what happens if a GR@@ B occurs in the Galaxy ?
in that case , what happens if the jet is directed at the earth ?
the oxygen and nitrogen molecules on our planet decom@@ pose to form nitrogen dioxide .
nitrogen dioxide is an acidic molecule that blocks the visible light .
so visible light can &apos;t get in .
every life depends on the sun .
without the visible light of the sun , our life cannot exist .
after the visible light is blocked , the ozone sphere will be destruc@@ ted , and then ultraviolet will come in .
so , the earth will be extremely cold .
and the ultraviolet can kill life directly .
therefore , the past extinc@@ tions of life on the earth might resulted from GR@@ B , when its jet was directed at the earth .
is there any evidence ?
life in the pel@@ ag@@ ic layer on the surface of the ocean once died out in large quantities .
while life in the deep sea could continue to exist .
the nau@@ til@@ us , for example , could survive .
of course , the extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago might also result from a GR@@ B .
well , I have to say it &apos;s extremely rare to see a GR@@ B happen in the Galaxy while its jet is directed at the earth .
it may happen once in tens of millions of years .
so , how can we observe Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts in the future ?
we can observe Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts through several high energy satellites .
internationally , there are S@@ wi@@ ft and Fer@@ mi .
in China , the In@@ sight H@@ ard X @-@ ray Mod@@ ulation Tel@@ es@@ cope was successfully launched on June 15 last year .
besides , we also have a Sino @-@ French Space Vari@@ able Ob@@ jects Monitor , which will be launched in 20@@ 21 .
the satellite includes gamma @-@ ray detector , optical telescope , hard x @-@ ray telescope , soft x @-@ ray telescope , ground wide angle camera and follow @-@ up observation system .
so it is able to detect Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts in the whole wave band from optics to gamma rays .
this is a huge pot , isn &apos;t it ?
many may know this , the Ti@@ any@@ an , or F@@ AST , of China .
the pot is rather enormous .
if you use it to cook .
it &apos;s enough for people all over the world to have three meals .
although being enormous , it is highly sensitive , which is fairly important for us to study Gam@@ ma @-@ ray bursts , especially from the radio band .
before I put an end , I &apos;d like to talk about why we need to explore the space .
first , we do so because we want to know the origin and evolution of all kinds of celestial bodies in the space .
which is very important .
by knowing this .
we know the origin and evolution of the sun and the ex@@ o@@ planets .
and see if we can move to some ex@@ o@@ planets , which is also quite important .
second , we want to study the physical laws under extreme conditions .
the laws we revealed on the earth are only based on laboratories , or on normal conditions .
but are those laws applicable to astronomical conditions or extreme conditions ?
in extreme conditions with high density , intense magnetic field , high temperature and strong gravity .
are they applicable ?
are they still right ?
through astronomy , we can disclose those mysteries .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so important .
thank you very much !
hello , everyone .
I am Cu@@ i Xia@@ ob@@ o from T@@ alk@@ ing@@ Data and I &apos;m very glad to come here at Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u Future .
I hope in the next 20 minutes , I can explain clearly our under@@ stan@@ ing of a proper relationship between a city and data .
first of all , we will look at a set of data .
as of last year , the number of active mobile phones in China had reached 1.3 billion .
mobile phones have already become an integral part of our daily life .
in other words , we have seen the born of the bowed @-@ head tribe .
secondly , the number of wear@@ able devices in China increases significantly .
for 40 million people , watch is the most common wear@@ able device and there are other kinds of wear@@ able devices .
the industry of the Internet of things is also developing rapidly .
as a result , both the volume and the dimension of the data have seen an exponential explosion .
you know what , the amount of data being produced in China in a year will reach 35 billion E@@ B in terms of storage capacity .
you might have no idea of its significance .
I will give you a vivid example .
if we put this amount of data into different hard drives with a storage capacity of 1@@ t each , then the total size of these hard drives is not enough to cover the 9.@@ 6 million square kilometers of land in China .
it is because the birth of mobile phones has caused an explosive increase in human behavioral data that keeps explo@@ ding at a high speed each year .
so in the next decade , we predict that the volume of over@@ al data on the Internet of things will grow much faster than that of mobile Internet , which is big data .
what exactly is big data ?
how was big data produced in the first place ?
is there any difference between big data and other conventional data ?
well , we usually mix big data with other conventional data , but they are different .
only data that sees an exponential outbreak is called big data .
we all know the Moore &apos;s Law and our computing ability is growing at a high speed .
for instance , our CP@@ Us , our existing computing ability , our main@@ frames , as well as the edge computing , we can see that the overall computing power has improved significantly in a synchronized manner .
because of big data or the growth of computing power , we are able to gradually generate intelligence by ourselves .
however , at this period of time , a complicated problem arises alongside the rapid increase of computing power and data volume .
in other words , our perspective on world will change from the physical materialism to that of data virtu@@ alization .
I will first tell you a story , so that you can have a better understanding of this issue .
last year I visited a number of unmanned vehicle manufacturers in the US , including W@@ ay@@ mo , a subsidiary of Google .
I paid a visit to Phoenix where W@@ ay@@ mo tests its vehicles , as you may know .
I managed to get into W@@ ay@@ mo &apos;s experimental base , right into its lab .
I immediately noticed that there were two screens placing in front of each researcher .
there was a written note posted on one of the screen , with the word &quot; simulation &quot; on it .
out of curiosity , I pat@@ ted the shoulder of a researcher next to me , and asked , &quot; What is this note for ? &quot;
he said that they didn &apos;t do that before , however , &quot; Sometimes , I don &apos;t know which is the real world and which is the simulated world made by sequence of binary digits . in my eyes they seem to be pretty much the same . &quot;
so we wonder , why is an Internet giant like Google doing this kind of things ?
let &apos;s take the unmanned car industry for example , Google now has the largest drive test data after over 10 years &apos; continuous investment .
the volume of the data is about 4 million miles of drive test .
Tes@@ la now has about 80,000 to 100,000 cars on the road each year , collecting all sorts of drive test data every day and the data volume is about 1 million miles .
but for a real dri@@ ver@@ less car to be able to hit the road , how much drive test data does it need ?
the drive test data of at least 100 million miles .
the current data collecting speed is too slow to achieve this goal , and how can we solve this problem ?
they ended up developing a simulation system , where they digi@@ tized every building , every road , street and even every tree or obstacle within Phoenix .
they managed to digi@@ tize the city with various methods .
in the mean time , different simulation programs of unmanned cars are put into use .
the unmanned cars will run in these simulated cities , ending up generating drive test data that covers over 1 million miles a day .
to us it is a new phenomenon .
someone might carry out a research on city development or other commercial problems , however , researches are no longer carried out in the physical world .
through abstr@@ acting and digi@@ tizing , people can create a digital world .
by making full use of infinite computing power and exponential data generating capability through the application of the Moore &apos;s laws , AI &apos;s comprehension capacity of the world could be accelerated with an enhanced learning method .
so this is a stage that all industries will have to go through in the future , so that &apos;s the reality we have to face now .
let &apos;s get back to our topic today , we are talking about our cities .
when we try to study cities , what are cities like in our minds ?
by city , do we mean the buildings that are made of steel or reinforced concrete or leisure facilities and parks ?
but somehow we gradually realized that the cities are not meant to be cold nor static .
look at this picture , it is made of pedestrian flow data in Beijing .
we did a visual simulation with the data .
we can now see it clearly , the ever running pedestrian flow in Beijing looks like our blood vascular system .
this is only a picture , but for those who worked in urban planning and urban research , is there any difference compared to your former experience ?
yes , the major difference is that it is dynamic , anything inside the picture is real time , and I can see the changes taking place at any given moment .
so , technological advancement and the development of data have made it possible to build a model that is completely dynamic , responsive and real @-@ time ; and by doing so we can look at our cities from a totally different perspective .
now please look at this picture .
it is an interesting picture , despite that it is not very clear .
I will explain .
this picture represents the map of Beijing .
there are two colors in the picture , red and blue .
what does the color red stand for ?
it refers to high @-@ income population .
then what does the color blue stand for ?
it refers to low @-@ income population .
we are using this picture to analyze the movement or trajectory of any given customer group .
in fact it is a conventional urban research method .
the entire urban planning , including the urban research method , can date back to the 18th century of the industrial age .
at that period of time , resources were scarce , and naturally a centralized supply system was introduced so as to ensure the ration@@ alized use of different resources .
for this reason , most cities would have financial streets or CB@@ D among others .
however , this kind of centralized supply system will cause great pressure to our modern cities , in terms of traffic network , supporting facilities and educational system among others .
this is not suitable for cities in the future .
well , when we take a close look at this picture , we find out that some problems have already occurred in Beijing , a densely populated city .
what do we call this phenomenon ?
we call it the space @-@ time folding .
what exactly is space @-@ time folding ?
you will find out that people with different income levels , from different social classes , despite that they are living in the same city , the chance for them to interact with each other is rather slim .
why ?
it is due to many factors , including their different living habits , nature of their works and different ti@@ met@@ ables .
as a result , these two types of people don &apos;t interact with each other at all .
what kind of impact will it have on a city ?
in fact , the impact has been proved by early theoretical researches .
it is necessary for people from different social class in a city to communicate or interact with each other , so that the city will have more vitality .
but a city that is based on centralized supply system is unable to facilitate interaction among people from different social classes and that is why the space @-@ time folding occurs .
the space @-@ time folding will cause a series of security problems for the city , such as polarization between the rich and the poor , as well as the unreasonable allocation of different resources and facilities .
we have noticed this phenomenon in many other cities for there are already some problems in China &apos;s current urban planning framework .
is there any effective measure to tackle these problems ?
actually we have carried out many experimental projects in Beijing .
in fact , we managed to collect information of the residents in Beijing .
the size of resident population of Beijing is about 26 million to 27 million , and by virtue of big data , we have acquired data concerning nearly 10 million residents in Beijing .
what kind of data is it ?
firstly , the data contains information relating to a resident &apos;s offline behaviors , location and movement tracks ; secondly , the data contains information of residents &apos; online behaviors , including the online visit habits and the frequently visited websites among others .
what do we plan to do with the data ?
we want to re @-@ classify the residents in Beijing , instead of classi@@ fying them into white @-@ collar or blue @-@ collar workers simply based on their income level in a cold and indifferent way .
so we applied a machine @-@ assisted learning tool to help us do the re @-@ classification job , and the diagram produced by this method is very interesting .
we named people with the same behavioral pattern , but the identification of people with the same behavioral pattern was completely carried out by the machine .
in other words , the machine helped us identify these different types of people .
you will soon find out that the machine has a very similar cognition compared to human .
people living in a big city have totally different lifestyles .
in the past , most people were wage ear@@ ners who started their work at 9 am and finished their work at 5 pm ; but now the machine finds out there is a group of people whom we call &quot; the happy stay @-@ at @-@ home fathers . &quot;
yes , they usually play computer games , keep a close eye on mother and baby products , and receive deliveries of purchased goods at home .
I must say that the proportion of this group of people is not low at all .
there is another type of people , and we call them &quot; urban freelance workers . &quot;
why ?
because , you know , with the rapid development of sharing economy , more and more people enter the food delivery or express delivery industry and become urban freelance workers .
they have a considerable commu@@ ting distance each day , as most of them live in the out@@ skirt areas .
however , they spend most of their time at an outdoor environment and travel extensively within the city .
there are a large number of them .
what else ?
there is a young female group who love literature and art shows , spend most of their time shopping and are sensitive to the cosmetic market .
gradually we come to realize that birds of a feather flock together , and it is really happening in the real life .
people can be classified into different groups by their lifestyle , their life track and habits .
this is the right direction for our research .
when having this new perspective , we came to realize that big data wasn &apos;t cold nor indifferent , instead , it could be people @-@ oriented and reflect people &apos;s lifestyle , or even the personality of an individual .
therefore we re @-@ designed our research module .
we wanted to find a urban planning mechanism that enabled residents to live a comfortable life .
so we came up with a brand new system and we call it &quot; the City L@@ ens . &quot;
this system is based on a big data technology which is percep@@ tual computing .
we use a variety of methods , including sensors , to collect data involving the city , the residents , cars , streets and all sorts of public facilities .
but it is not the most important thing , as you know that it is all static data .
we want to do something more , and we are trying to create a three @-@ dimensional model to reflect our city .
if you are familiar with Beijing , and you will know that this location is somewhere near Beijing World Tower , and the building bearing the red mark is the China Hotel .
when you take a close look at this area , you will notice that there are different kinds of people there .
there were 7 groups of people , as we have classified , and we could see the behavioral pattern of them in this area , including their activity frequency and habits .
so when will they show up in this area ?
by applying this new approach , we have offered a new solution to the urban development in the future .
the idea is totally different .
we call it &quot; the city @-@ response model . &quot;
in other words , the future city is not powered by centralized supply system anymore .
the city will re@@ distribute its resources based on the lifestyle and gathering spots of its residents .
so I think in the future , what matters it not about having a financial street , a CB@@ D or a university town in a city .
rather , within a given area , as long as a particular group of people are gathering together , we need to provide support to them , by setting up a neighborhood center as in Singapore , or a community center , so as to minimize their commu@@ ting time and give them access to a great variety of public infrastructure facilities .
to us , it is a new way to study the urban development in the future .
so is it enough to only have the human behavior information ?
far from enough .
we notice that our governments and enterprises as well have paid too much attention to the human behavior reflected by the big data .
but gradually we come to realize that human behavior is not important at all .
what matter to us is that why a man is driven to do something , and why this man will form a special lifestyle in the first place .
to us that is the most important thing .
so we set up a people @-@ oriented data lab , a joint project with Media Lab from the MT@@ I .
what is the Lab for ?
in fact , researchers don &apos;t study human behaviors at all , they are very concerned about the human mind .
they conduct various community activities , interviewing people and talking to them .
these researchers want to find out the reason behind a man &apos;s particular behavioral pattern .
this research institution , which is actually made up of a group of soci@@ ologists and psychologists , studies the relationship between the human body and the environment .
why is it important to have this kind of research ?
please take a look at the picture on your left .
it is produced by City L@@ ens Lab , a joint project with MIT .
it is a city made by LE@@ GO pieces .
it &apos;s a panor@@ amic view of a city made by LE@@ GO pieces .
in reality , it is a city module made by digital simulations .
what is this system for ?
it is placed in Paris , France and it is designed to facilitate interaction with local residents .
I have studied a number of smart city projects across the country , however , the ideology behind these projects is still driven by concepts such as strengthened management , supervision and oversight .
to me , that is not the future trend at all .
for example , to build a transportation facility or a new landmark in the city , the government will have a hearing which requires active participation of the residents .
so at the hearing we have urban planning authorities standing there , but a resident might come up , with a LE@@ GO module in his hands .
he might say that , &quot; I want to move that building to a new location , this commercial office building and that residential building should exchange location . &quot;
that &apos;s the purpose of this system .
each adjustment will naturally lead to the changes of different key data .
whenever you relocate a particular building , the system will help you figure out a number of key data , including the commu@@ ting index , traffic congestion index , trend of the house price and consumption index .
this is something that the public is very concerned about in the future .
we have seen many advanced cities in the world are following this approach , and people @-@ oriented concept has been incorporated into their urban planning and construction .
we have carried out other projects as well , as we want to have an in @-@ depth research on this topic .
and this project is the most representative one .
this project is based in D@@ ash@@ il@@ an in Beijing .
please raise your hands if you have heard of this place .
good , half of the audiences know about this place .
it is somewhere near Qi@@ anmen in Beijing , and now it is a famous tourist attraction .
designers love this spot .
we once made a thermod@@ ynamic diagram during the golden week of the National Day holiday .
there is a street , named Yang@@ me@@ iz@@ hu@@ xi@@ e@@ jie , in the middle of the D@@ ash@@ il@@ an , and the lay@@ outs in the left and right side are completely different .
how so ?
the left side is the renovation area by the government , where old buildings were demolished and many so called time @-@ honored brands were moved into a high @-@ end commercial district .
the right side remains intact , mostly being quad@@ rang@@ le courtyard , old town and old hut@@ ong .
the thermod@@ ynamic diagram tells a fact vividly .
people will flock to the old town and quad@@ rang@@ le courty@@ ards during daytime , but nobody loves visiting the so @-@ called high @-@ end commercial district endorsed by urban planning authorities .
we wanted to run an experiment .
how did we do it ?
we developed a game for residents living on that street .
it is like playing LE@@ GO .
we invited these residents to place various buildings anywhere as they liked .
the buildings in different colors are various infrastructure facilities , including restaurants , convenient facilities and small shops .
and we invite elder citizens and children to play with this game .
we said to them , &quot; It is your community . if you are the designer of this community , what will you do ? &quot;
so you can tell that it is a fun game .
the picture on the right is particularly interesting .
you can find out that local residents are rather imaginative .
their space design plan is beyond our imagination .
we can tell the rationality of this kind of space design@@ .We also looked for professional assistance from urban planning authorities and they provided us their design plan .
to be honest , the design plan by residents is more reasonable , or more adaptable to their daily life in that community .
more and more communities with this kind of design concept have emerged in China , communities that are people @-@ oriented .
it is an ongoing project on that street .
if you have free time , please take a look there .
we have placed many advanced equipment and devices in those quad@@ rang@@ le courty@@ ards , so as to help local residents improve the quality of lives .
I would say by this way we are collecting people @-@ oriented data .
why ?
we have to take a people @-@ oriented approach to carry out urban planning , or smart city or smart community projects , we must return back to the fundamental relation between a city and data .
the data is collected from the people , and naturally we should make good use of the data analysis result so as to better serve the general public .
seven years ago , when we first started our company , several founders of the company had a nice chat at a park .
we asked ourselves a question , &quot; What is the ultimate role of data technology if we manage to do it well ? &quot;
we summed up two sentences at that time , we believed that data technology will change the decision @-@ making process of all enterprises .
in the past , many hasty decisions were made by instinct , or in accordance with sen@@ iority or official titles ; however , more and more Chinese enterprises will use a data @-@ driven approach to increase their commercial value .
that is why we believe that the data technology will help improve the quality of our lives , and that was one of our original aspirations .
smart intelligence and intelligence are widely discussed in recent years .
I will tell you our understanding of the real intelligence .
there are way too many intel@@ li@@ gen@@ ces , including AI , unmanned dr@@ ones , intelligent robots or unmanned cars , and then we start calling V@@ R as a form of AI .
so actually from our point of view , it &apos;s very simple .
intelligence only deals with one thing , which is decision making .
by nature , artificial intelligence helps us make a sound decision based on the data analysis results .
do I need to open a shop at this location ?
shall I lend money to this guy ?
is it necessary to make a building over there ?
shall I run some resident activities at that site ?
these all involve artificial intelligence .
from our point of view , if a form of intelligence is unable to help us make a sound decision , the value of the intelligence is relatively low .
we know that Al@@ pha@@ GO has defeated humans being , it is because its decision @-@ making quality is better than that of humans .
why no unmanned vehicle can hit the road yet ?
simply put , its intelligence level is not up to the standard of a man .
in that case , the so @-@ called intelligence is of no value at all .
a L@@ 3 @-@ level unmanned vehicle program can only assist driving .
the entire industrial chain is still monopol@@ ized by those big factories , such as BMW and Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z , as you haven &apos;t changed anything and your best role is to assist them .
it is because the intelligence level is not that advanced yet .
so , from our point of view , there is only one standard to evaluate a particular form of intelligence , that is , can it replace people to make decisions ?
however , we are still in the era of man @-@ machine coordination , and we humans need to work together with machines to make decisions .
but AI can only be valuable when its decision @-@ making quality is better than that of a man , or more efficient than man , and only till that moment , we could call it AI .
but now take a look at the relationship between a city and data , we know that its power is unlimited , and we can use the power to make a difference .
we can use it to improve urban planning and urban residents &apos; convenience level .
last month , in my visit to the UK , I once had an interesting dialogue with its former Prime Minister Cameron .
I told him that in a way AI could change the outcome of an election , &quot; Are you , as a politician yourself , in fear that you might lose your job someday ? &quot;
why ?
because AI can decide your chance of winning .
he was very excited about it .
we had a long discussion on this topic .
there was only one thing that we agree on , that is we believed that AI couldn &apos;t have the integrity that we find in humans .
AI has no humanity so it can be both evil and good .
so , for builders of future cities and owners of big data , what is the most important thing ?
integrity is the most important thing .
many in@@ expl@@ icable phenomena occur in our market , for example , you might be harass@@ ed by real estate agents or insurance agents , but why ?
it is because owners and users of those data assets haven &apos;t followed the track of integrity .
that is the very reason behind those in@@ expl@@ icable phenomena .
because it is very easy to tell if a data company has any morals or integrity .
I will use this sentence to end my speech .
7 years ago we wanted to create a big data company that helped enterprises to make smart decisions , and enable big data to help people live a better life .
however , at this stage , I think the most important thing is that we need to be a big data company with integrity .
thank you .
hi , I &apos;m Tang Ge and I graduated from Tong@@ ji University .
yeah , I spent five years getting my bachelor &apos;s degree in urban planning .
yes , five years , no grade repeat , seriously .
five years , without grade repeat .
the major of urban planning requires five years of study .
some people may not know this .
you may not know much about urban planning , just like you don &apos;t know much about our city .
so this is actually what we &apos;re talking about today , how far is the smart city from us ?
nobody knows .
we have many questions about the city that we need to answer in different ways .
I have been studying the city , and data .
maybe we can combine them and answer the questions about the city with data .
one might ask , how many people are there in Shanghai ?
it &apos;s a ridiculous question , you know ?
you can &apos;t ask how many people there are in a city , why ?
the question is difficult to answer in one sentence .
so , I made this graph .
the data is collected by B@@ AT and other companies through all kinds of mobile devices .
here it is .
this is a curve of Shanghai &apos;s population .
let &apos;s look at the first point .
it is the Spring Festival .
it is the time when there are the fe@@ west people in the city .
yes .
people come back after the Spring Festival .
after that , the Ching Ming Festival comes first after it .
people go out of the city , so the curve comes down .
and next , the May Day holiday comes .
people go out again .
then , the Dragon Boat Festival comes , and people go out again .
later , the long summer vacation begins .
at this time , people all over the country flock to Shanghai for fun or study .
the population in Shanghai peak at about 30 million .
there is not much break after the summer vacation until October , the National Day .
as you can see , the curve comes down really fast during the National Day .
people have been working for a long time , and they can finally go out , for fun .
so there are much fewer people in the city .
then , some of them leave around the New Year &apos;s Day and just don &apos;t come back until the following Spring Festival .
this , is the population of Shanghai .
you can &apos;t simply give a number when people ask you how many people there are in Shanghai .
you know , there are complicated changes happening in Shanghai every minute .
there can be only 15 million people during the Spring Festival , and there can be as many as 30 million at peak .
there are many such questions .
some may ask , is the housing price there going up or coming down ?
up or down ?
nobody knows now .
some people think it is still very expensive , others feel that it seems to be cheaper now .
here is a graph .
this is the price of second @-@ hand homes in Shanghai in 20@@ 16 , The horizontal axis is the price , and the vertical axis is the approximate proportion .
the trading volume is very close to supply .
the supply price peaked at about RMB 50,000 , and the highest transaction price is about RMB 40,000 .
back in 20@@ 16 , people thought that the housing price was too high and the government should do something .
OK , it introduced a policy .
it is kind of ridiculous to regulate the real estate market with a policy , What happened then ?
this is what happened .
the two curves start to diver@@ ge .
what does it mean ?
the supply price continues to go up , but the trading price comes down .
we can make a comparison .
there are more properties priced at RMB 100,000 or even higher .
there are more properties that are expensive .
but more people are looking for a cheaper home .
we &apos;ve disrupted the market with a very strong policy , leaving no one to buy expensive homes .
they have to look for cheaper properties .
it seems that the housing price has fallen , but it is still expensive actually , and people still can &apos;t afford it .
these are the problems we have created .
actually , we don &apos;t understand the space law of the real estate market .
we think it &apos;s very expensive , especially within the inner ring of the city .
that is true .
this is the unit price .
the red area marks the highest unit price , basically in the city center , within the inner ring .
is it really so ?
not really .
why ?
we should focus on the total price when buying a home , because we usually borrow money from the bank .
here is the total price .
not all the expensive homes are in the city center .
where are they then ?
some are in the city center .
but are there any in Zhang@@ jiang ?
in Tang Town ?
in Xin Jiang@@ wan ?
in Sh@@ es@@ han ?
yes .
the houses are distributed in this way according to the total price .
so what we see is a complicated real estate market in a complicated city .
you can imagine that to answer such a complicated question with a simple solution will inevitably lead to some unexpected problems .
some people may ask , is there enough housing supply in Shanghai ?
it &apos;s simple .
you put all the people on the map and see what happens .
here are all the residents in Shanghai .
a high area indicates a high population density .
and a low area indicates a low population density .
as we can see that the population density here is even higher than that in the city center .
but what if we put all the houses on the map ?
we put every property on the map .
there are about 7.@@ 6 million properties in Shanghai .
let us divide the population by the number of properties .
you can find the average number of people living in each property .
let us take a look at this data .
it is from 20@@ 16 .
the average level of the whole city was 3.2 people .
it was fairly reasonable .
there were about 7 million properties for about 20 million people , so there are about 3 people in a home .
that was reasonable .
but it &apos;s not evenly distributed .
in the area of T@@ il@@ an@@ qiao , there are an average of 8 people living in each property .
you see more people living together in a rental property .
there are also more sh@@ acks in this area .
there are only 0.8 people in a house in Xin Jiang@@ wan , Yang@@ pu District .
the population of this city is uneven .
what can we learn from that ?
questions about the city should be analyzed in terms of time and space range .
the market we see is all complex and separated .
you can &apos;t answer in a simple way and with simple data .
you have to consider specific information .
otherwise , we may come to some absurd conclusions .
we may also be concerned about the traffic congestion in the city .
traffic jams are annoying .
that is because of the dense population in the city center .
that is so annoying .
let us move people out of the downtown , and things will get better , right ?
it is a very simple idea .
I used to think the same way , and so did many master planners .
we call it urban relief .
I could not believe that we actually did it .
let us take a look .
these are the two cens@@ uses in Shanghai in 2000 @-@ 2010 .
the red areas show increased population and the blue areas show decreased population .
where did the population increase ?
the mid @-@ ring area got a lot more populated , while the downtown area is all blue .
we &apos;ve really kicked people out .
we &apos;ve really done that , and it sounds amazing , yes .
and it &apos;s been going on and on until 2015 .
the latest data show that this state of affairs is continuing , even expanding .
let us take a look at the scope .
in the past people were just moved to the mid @-@ ring area .
but now , they are driven to the outer ring .
we did move people out .
let &apos;s see what information we can get from the subway data .
this is an increase in the number of people entering subway stations at peak hours , mainly in the outer area .
it is a big circle .
if you go to such subway stations in G@@ uc@@ un or S@@ ongjiang along Line 9 .
you will see many more people there than ever before .
does it even help when we move people to the outer ring ?
it doesn &apos;t .
why ?
let us look at this graph .
this is where people go to work .
people still work there .
there is nothing you can do about that .
here we can see these lines , which are the paths they take to go to work .
no matter where you move them , they come back to the city center for work .
the thing is , the farther you push people away , the more they get blocked .
why is that ?
they spend more time on the road .
they might need 5 minutes in the past , but now , it takes 10 minutes or 50 minutes .
when people spend more time on the road , there are more traffic .
if you divide the number of people by the area of the road and the time spent , you will see that the congestion is getting worse .
it is just math .
people may say , it is simple .
can &apos;t we just throw these offices out ?
good idea .
I think it is quite reasonable .
we did that , too , you know .
we seriously did it .
we were not just saying it .
we actually did it .
this is the concentration distribution of technology industry registration places in Shanghai in recent years .
this bright area , which I circled out , sees dramatically increased registered enterprises .
let us continue .
of course , Pan@@ angle Square and Zhang@@ jiang are great locations . we all know that .
where else ?
for example , Ji@@ ading , Ling@@ ang New City , Chang@@ xing Island and Chong@@ ming Island also see big increase .
I don &apos;t see why the technology companies want to set office on Chong@@ ming Island .
of course , Chong@@ ming Island has its own advantage .
but I do not think it is the right advantage for a technology company .
so , these are the places where companies got registered .
we actually moved these companies to the outer area , but what happened then ?
let us see where they actually do business .
we have marked out the areas .
the bright circles we just saw now fade away .
these companies were registered there , got subsidies and paid less tax .
but the real office is still in the city center .
why ?
it is simple .
companies are profit @-@ seeking and subject to human capital exter@@ n@@ alities .
so they have to be concentrated in the city center to generate more value .
the rule is the rule .
when we break the rule , we are attacked by the data and other things .
therefore , we see many problems in our city , the dense population , expensive housing and heavy traffic .
we have a lot of data to explain them .
are these data useful ?
have we made things better ?
we have very powerful technology that are quite eye @-@ catching .
we have conducted many smart city projects .
we want to make the city smarter .
but why have we not solved the above problems ?
Shanghai , the most developed city in China , has not solved any of these three problems .
why ?
I &apos;m thinking , too .
it makes me feel that what we have done before is meaningless .
because it did not produce any practical value .
I watched a movie , Black Pan@@ ther , lately , and you have probably watched it as well . I came to feel relieved about these problems we are facing .
I started to think after the movie .
there is a city named &quot; W@@ ak@@ anda &quot; in it .
it is a greatly developed city .
I think maybe it is a smart city .
it looks cool .
its streets look like this .
it seems better than Shanghai , right ?
the scientists there use super technologies that I have not even heard of .
they have powerful public service facilities , including public transport .
this is a fight between two people on a public transit track .
I didn &apos;t find a picture of its public transit .
but it is powered by magnetic suspension technique .
they have private parking lots like this .
it &apos;s a very sc@@ i @-@ fi , developed city .
but it may look ridiculous to you .
because it elec@@ ts its leadership like this .
it was ridiculous .
how could there be such a big gap ?
then , I came to figure it out .
China was a great country in the ancient time .
we have the four great inventions , including gun@@ powder .
but why are we always being bul@@ lied ?
it is simple .
the wisdom of a city is totally a different thing from its wealth and technology .
they are totally different things .
the city is a complex entity .
its wealth does not mean everything .
there are many rich cities .
Dubai is super rich , but is it necessarily a smart city ?
population , housing , transportation , can you solve these problems with technology ?
maybe you can , maybe not .
what I &apos;m thinking is , it doesn &apos;t matter that we didn &apos;t solve these problems .
now , we are coming back to our topic today .
it is the core of our discussion .
we did a lot of data and research related work .
we want to reveal a lot about the city .
but we found that it didn &apos;t help .
it did not make our lives better .
we might wonder the relationship between technology and organization .
like what it is like in the Black Pan@@ ther , it has powerful technology .
but its organization is so stupid , isn &apos;t it ?
they fight to achieve organizational evolution .
what is the relationship between technology and organization ?
we are also promoting new projects to try to figure out this relationship .
this is what we did last year .
we launched a program , and it is named &quot; 15 Min@@ ute Circle . &quot;
we want every resident to be able to get to the public service facilities he / she wants within 15 minutes after going out .
this is a very great topic .
this is actually a very typical spatial algorithm based on scarcity .
in other words , we just need to draw the true range that can be achieved within 15 minutes of walking .
it &apos;s not just a random circle .
the range it covers has to be the place you can actually get to within 15 minutes .
you cannot reach every corner by walk within that range , right ?
then , we put other data including population and the public service facilities on the map , with their ranges overl@@ apped .
in this way , we can assess the public service facilities in each area reasonably and quickly .
to see if you can access them within 15 minutes .
it will be nice if you can , but if you can &apos;t , we can use some scarcity @-@ based algorithms to provide advice .
to tell you where to build a school , a food market , a public toilet or service facilities for the elderly .
we believe that this is something meaningful .
the part we remembered the most vividly is all the meetings we had , so many of them .
we &apos;ve had meetings with all these relevant departments .
if you want to build some service facilities for the elderly , you need to talk to the health bureau and the civil affairs bureau .
if you are planning to build a school , you should talk to the education bureau .
things about cultural services should be negotiated with the bureau of culture and broadcasting .
you also have to meet the sports bureau leaders when you want to build some trails .
there are many meetings to go through .
you need to listen to their instructions for the adjustment of data and standardization .
after we have finished these tasks .
we will hand them over to the Planning Institute of Shanghai Urban Planning and Land Resource Administration Bureau .
people form the Planning Institute can then start working with the map .
they &apos;re going to go from place to place , figure out if different facilities can be shared .
if some of the floors can be accessed from above or below .
there are many details for them to cover .
they have to go to the sites themselves and see if we have recommended the right place .
you will mark the right places on the map .
the finished map will be sent to sub @-@ districts and towns for implementation then .
we got a clear feeling that it is very important that you have advanced technology .
some useful algorithms and a machine learning model , so that you can be able to explain the city .
but more importantly , you have to get into the organization so that you can optimize its work .
you can &apos;t get things done by simply giving suggestions outside .
we have to go into it .
the city is a very complicated system .
do you think it &apos;s easy to build a public toilet ?
it &apos;s not simple at all .
do you know how many departments are in charge behind the toilet ?
do you think it is easy to have one more green space ?
no , it is not .
there are many departments involved .
there are complex approval processes and budget systems .
in the city , even the smallest problems are in this extremely complex system .
if you ignore the system , if you don &apos;t understand or go into the system .
what you do will be like beating cotton with your fi@@ sts , and that &apos;s our strongest feeling .
take the &quot; 15 Min@@ ute Circle &quot; for example .
we work in a district , and there are 8 bureaus and commissions under the district government to contact .
there are countless civil servants .
we &apos;re going to connect 36 sub @-@ districts and towns , including 1,@@ 28@@ 3 neighborhood committees .
you just have to cover them all .
it is not like you are in a lab .
you cannot just operate all the data with a computer in a lab or your office .
you have to go there , to the sites and get things done through some practical work .
of course , what we have done is just the scientific decision @-@ making .
it seems that we should do more , so we build a data platform with the government of the New City .
we wanted to provided more with what we have accumulated in our work for their daily use .
that was a good idea .
the first step is to collect all the data .
that is right .
we always talk about AI and other advanced technology .
what is a database like in the age of AI ?
can you guess what it looks like ?
in reality , they look like this , yeah , they &apos;re all Exc@@ el sheets , in different formats .
you &apos;re going to run into Exc@@ el 2003 .
can you imagine ? nowadays ?
yes , the 2007 version is already very good .
this form is stored in Wang &apos;s office , and that is in Zhang &apos;s computer .
some forms are stored in Li &apos;s computer last year , but he left .
Zhao is now in charge of this part ... there are all these things to deal with then .
but you have to get the job done , otherwise you cannot solve the problem .
what should you do ?
get the things done .
you should build a system with all kinds of algorithms .
you sort them out and put them on the map in a system .
there will be more people working on it .
you teach the staff how to work on the platform , to use the tools , to analyze and to make decisions .
you will also store all the data in a smart@@ phone , give them to your leader for quick review .
this helps complete the whole process , from data to decision making .
what we have been thinking after that is what is the most powerful part of technology or data ?
we made scientific decisions , and yes , we have done something interesting .
but we believe that the most important part is the destructive restructuring of the organization .
what is that ?
let me tell you .
here is an idea of our own .
there is a kind of organization in the world called a report @-@ driven organization .
it is driven by reporting level by level .
you may find data loss at every single level during this process .
people can choose what to tell their leader .
it is not because they do not want to tell .
sometimes they just forget or make some mistake .
that is why the information obtained by the upper level is always filtered out .
the new method has changed the situation , how ?
after getting the information , people at the lower level can put it in the working system , so that the leaders can see the same thing .
the message is not passed by people .
it is conveyed through algorithms and machines , to Level B , C and D .
the organizational structure can be gradually altered to a data @-@ driven one .
you can say the structure is getting flat .
that is the original function of technology and data .
it makes the organization flat and helps it move on with its work quickly .
we will turn it into a circular structure , with a data warehouse and some algorithms in the center .
everyone is working around data .
they can discuss on the same platform on the same ground , instead of just talking to themselves .
this relatively inefficient reporting model will be gradually adjusted to a more popular and efficient data @-@ driven organization model .
we have gradually learnt about this process .
it does not happen overnight .
you may find something different today , tomorrow and next month .
you may see new stuff every day .
that is what I said about going into the organization before you can optimize it with technology .
on the other hand , what can people working in technology learn from this ?
the most important part is that the only technology that &apos;s useful is the technology that optim@@ izes the organization .
the technology that doesn &apos;t make our lives better is just toy .
to change the city , we have to leverage some useful technologies .
whether they are advanced or not , whether they simple or sophisticated .
the point is they have to be useful .
how far are we from a truly smart city ?
far , far away .
it does not matter .
the point is that if we are moving in the right direction , step by step .
how to approach the smart city we want ?
we need the right technology .
we can solve the small problems first , such as a public toilet .
we can build some &quot; 15 Min@@ ute Cir@@ cles , &quot; optimize the review , report and the process .
you should deal with small problems first .
better small parts will help upgrade the complex system of our city , and enable systems of decision @-@ making and governance better and more scientific .
these are what I would like to share with you today .
generally speaking , a smart urban decision @-@ making organization is the premise of a truly smart city .
thank you .
good afternoon , everyone .
I &apos;m Shen Y@@ id@@ ong from Shanghai Institute of Bio@@ chemistry and Cell Biology , C@@ AS .
I &apos;m very glad to have this opportunity in sharing my idea of aging , and this idea is from the perspective of a scientist of modern biology .
I think that almost everyone is interested with the topic of aging .
I think it is one of the oldest scientific problems .
in China , a long time ago there were legends like the God of Long@@ evity and the Magic Pe@@ aches offered as a birthday present .
it was the same in the Europe .
people believed that there must be a pool of youth , where you could become younger as long as you jump in and take a bath there .
these were only ut@@ opian dreams .
this is the curve of a change in the average life expectancy of people across the world in the past hundreds of years .
we can tell that in the past few hundreds of years , especially with the advancement of industrialization , we have made huge progress in making this dream come true .
in the past the average life expectancy was only 20 to 30 years old , but now it is 70 to 80 years old .
for some developed countries , the figure will even reach nearly 90 years old .
what is the role of modern science behind this process ?
there is one thing that you might find it least expected , that is we have built a basic and modern health system .
to put it simply , many developed countries at that time had had taken measures to ensure that each household would have a flush toilet and be able to use running water .
people were advised not to dump rubbish in@@ discrimin@@ ately and a modern waste collection system had been set up .
this was the first step .
it was an effective step to prevent the large @-@ scale outbreak of infectious diseases .
secondly , in the 19@@ 40s , antibiotic was invented , and you might be very familiar with this part of history .
the invention of antibiotic was a magical thing .
it was not designed to treat any particular disease .
however , with the availability of antibiotic , we are able to treat literally almost all bacteria @-@ infected diseases .
take a look at this picture .
you can find out that when our average life span has reached nearly 80 years old , the curves then enter a platform period .
in other words , how can we achieve a breakthrough as significant as the invention of antibiotics ?
from the point of view of scientists like me who study aging , we think that the next crucial step in increasing our average life span is through the application of anti @-@ aging methods .
why is that so ?
we might encounter many major diseases in our lives , such as cancers and cardiovascular diseases .
these diseases sound awful .
would our average life span improve significantly as long as we have had ready cures for these diseases ?
at the turn of this century , the US government did a hypo@@ thetical research - if all your diseases were cured overnight , what would happen next ?
for example , all your cancers were gone when you woke up in the morning , as if you had caught a cold .
what would happen next ?
you might end up living 3.5 extra years .
cardiovascular disease is now considered as the number one killer for our human being .
what would happen if it can be cured overnight ?
you can live about 5 years longer , that &apos;s it .
in other words , it is very difficult to expect a sharp increase of average life span , say , an increase of 10 to 20 years , after we have developed a cure for a singular disease .
the significance is different from the invention of antibiotics .
what &apos;s more , curing a disease is technically difficult .
why ?
the reason is rather simple .
when you are getting older , you will eventually have either this disease or other diseases , and the fact is very sad .
so we believe that anti @-@ aging approach might be the most effective one .
why do we have the courage to say so ?
it is because of our research findings .
we notice that the fat@@ ality rate and morbidity rate of those major diseases , including those diseases caused by bacterial infections in the past , are closely related to your age .
in fact , this is also consistent with our life experience , that is , the older the age , the more likely to get sick and go to the hospital .
this is what we think , all diseases are closely associated with old age or aging .
therefore , if we can find ways to delay aging from its root cause , or reverse your aging process , then your chances of having these diseases will drop significantly .
this is a bit like the moment when the antibiotic was first invented in the 19@@ 40s .
antibiotic was not meant to treat pneumonia alone , but all diseases caused by bacterial infections .
we are doing exactly the same .
we want to promote this anti @-@ aging method , which is not meant to cure neuro@@ de@@ generative disease or cancers , but all those diseases being listed here that elderly people are inclined to have .
what is our expectation when carrying out this research ?
you might have read the slide with the word &quot; immortal &quot; on it .
I believe that it is indeed a romantic dream to be immortal .
it is a distant dream , but not an impossible one .
so in reality what do we want to achieve ?
at the top of this chart is the course of life of every ordinary person .
in the last 10 to 20 years , you might live in pain .
what we are trying to do , look at the line at the bottom of the chart , is to increase your life span and shorten the time that you have to battle with diseases .
this is not an impossible dream , and we have abundant evidences , be it on animals or on a human being , to prove that this method is viable .
I will give you a brief introduction to the understanding of aging by modern biology .
first of all , I want to tell you that the wisdom of ancient Chinese still works today .
ancient Chinese people valued the yin and yang balance , and something would go wrong if the balance had been broken .
it is a very simple , traditional theory , but it works well to aging .
of course , modern biology has added new meaning to this traditional theory .
some aging factors , that can be perceived and measured scientifically , do exist in our bodies .
naturally , our bodies will take counter @-@ measures , and there has always been a working mechanism .
we can simply say that we also have the longevity factors , including DNA repair and the mechanism to remove junk proteins .
unfortunately , when you are getting older , the aging factor side will inevitably increase , and the longevity factor side will inevitably weaken .
that &apos;s why everyone would become old .
why does the change happen ?
these are the questions that need to be answered by our biology scientists .
this was a theory that was first proposed in the 1950s .
it was based on the evolutionary point of view , and explained why there was such an imbalance in your body , and why you got older .
a classical theory was proposed at that time , which is still applicable now , suggesting that during tens of millions years &quot; evolution .
your body &apos;s most important concern is whether you , as an animal , can produce a healthy offspring at all .
evolution has a strong selective pressure on your body , before you are able to produce an offspring .
however , after you have finished producing an offspring , the pressure is gone .
let &apos;s see an example .
just like you are attending a class , prior to you having an offspring , there is always a teacher sitting in your classroom , keeping a close eye on every student &apos;s homework .
but when you have produced your offspring , the teacher goes back home .
and the classroom becomes what the right picture displays here , in other words , your body is in a chaotic state .
many research findings , including mine , have suggested the same thing .
some well @-@ behaving students in the first half of the class become bad students in the second half of the class ; and for this reason you are getting older .
if we make one step further , we need to explain the phenomenon of aging from the perspectives of genetic and molecular levels .
I will first talk about how we study aging .
we need a module to study aging , and normally we will use animals that appear on this chart to carry out aging related researches .
the animal on the far left side is called nem@@ at@@ ode , which can only live for three weeks , and we human beings are on the far right side .
for those animals with a relatively short life span , we are able to obtain their life expectancy data .
however , for those animals that live long , for example , our human beings with a possible life span of 80 years old .
it is difficult for us to be sure that one approach or theory works in increasing the life expectancy .
but we can know whether some measures are effective in relieving aging related symptoms .
so , through these model animals , especially the lef@@ t@@ most nem@@ at@@ ode .
we learned a piece of encouraging news that aging can be genetically regulated .
you might feel the news insignificant , but you know in the 1960s there was a theory claiming that aging was a passive process , in other words , we human beings are unable to intervene in this process .
but now we know that aging is actually an active process .
because it &apos;s active in itself , you can intervene in it .
in the 1990s , people finally discovered first signal routing line , which was a line formed by molecular genes .
that was the insulin signal routing line .
in our research with the nem@@ at@@ ode , we noticed that once we had removed one mut@@ ant gene , the animal would live twice to three times of its original life span .
as for the insulin signal routing line , we don &apos;t need to go further details , as the naming of these genes and principles of biology are rather complicated .
the simplest interpretation is that with this insulin signal routing line the animal is likely to have mild diabetes .
you know , insulin is designed to reduce the concentration level of blood sugar .
with the availability of this insulin signal routing line , some rubbish in your body can be recycled and unnecessary metabolism in your body can be reduced .
by doing so , your body can reach an orderly and sustainable state .
after the discovery of this signal routing line , in the past 3 decades , we have discovered more molecular structures that are involved in regulating the process of aging .
so , as I mentioned at the very beginning , all of these molecules , although they have formed a very complex network of molecules , can still be roughly divided into two categories .
some of them are designed to accelerate the process of aging , while the others are designed to confront with these aging factors .
we have known the molecular mechanisms in our research , and therefore we hope that we can find a way to delay the process of aging .
in other words , when we are getting older , we can find a way to minimize the effect caused by aging factors and magni@@ fy the effect caused by longevity factors .
we believe that , by doing so , even you are in your old age , we might help you live longer , improve your health condition and avoid having a series of age @-@ sensitive diseases .
finally I will talk about the possible solutions to delaying the process of aging from the perspective of modern biology .
simply put , you have to control your environmental factor and genetic factor , that is , internal and external causes .
the environmental factor is easy to understand , as you need to find a nice place to live , and should not live in a ha@@ zy city .
it is not a joke anymore , and has been backed by scientific research findings .
two years ago the result of a co@@ hort study was published .
researchers noticed that the average life span of people living in the north of the Hu@@ ai@@ he River , a region with a serious air pollution problem , was 2 to 3 years shorter than that of people living in the south of the Hu@@ ai@@ he River , a region with a better air quality .
here is one more thing .
despite that it is irrelevant to any research findings , you should live in a place where you have access to high @-@ quality medical services .
actually it is universally true .
if you want to live longer , you should rather live a place that is near a major hospital but not a remote island with a beautiful view .
apart from having this done , what shall we do to live a longer life ?
the first method , which you might have already heard of , is called diet control .
in other words , you need to eat less , so that you can live longer and healthier .
this method is not merely a voice of experience , but has been proved so by scientific research findings .
well , from the simplest nem@@ at@@ ode , sac@@ char@@ omy@@ c@@ etes to pri@@ mates , such as mac@@ a@@ ques , an observ@@ able phenomenon has occurred .
that is , when an animal enters a state of di@@ eting , it can live longer and healthier .
look at the monkeys in the picture on your right .
monkeys , like our human beings , will lose their hair when they are older .
you can see that the monkey on a diet is very healthy , and the hair on the body is very shiny .
however , for monkeys , at about the same age and without having any diet , you can tell that their hair is almost gone , and they might live much shorter .
but the real di@@ eting is not the so @-@ called concept of &quot; 70 % fullness of stomach appearing in the newspapers and magazines .
the real di@@ eting is much harder to endure than the 70 % fullness of stomach .
the concept of 70 % fullness of stomach only meets the dietary standards recommended by nutri@@ tion@@ ists , but the real di@@ eting will require you to cut a further 30 % .
generally speaking , under such a circumstance , everyone will feel a strong sense of hunger , which will make you become m@@ oody .
I don &apos;t know what other people think , but I will definitely feel very bad .
nutrition issues will arise .
you &apos;re more likely to feel exhausted .
your cognitive function and your mental and psychological well @-@ being are deteriorating .
it is indeed very hard to endure the pain of di@@ eting .
then we come up with a new idea .
if we can &apos;t eat less , can we change our dietary structure ?
I mean to eat more healthy foods and consume less harmful foods .
let &apos;s return back to the insulin signal routing line .
insulin is designed to regulate the blood sugar level .
Ms. C@@ yn@@ th@@ ia Ken@@ yon , the person who first discovered insulin signal routing line , suggests a solution , saying that maybe we can reduce our sugar intake and manually reduce the blood sugar level .
she suggests that you should eat more vegetables and fruit , but don &apos;t eat vegetables and fruits that contain a lot of sugar , like watermelon .
it is OK for you to eat meat and fish .
she also marked this line in red .
I bet you must can read it clearly .
she suggested that we should not eat potato , spaghetti and flour @-@ made dishes , as flour @-@ made dishes are the biggest sources of blood sugar in our body .
this theory is totally different from the theory that you have heard many times at TV programs , suggesting that you should have more coarse grains and eat less meat .
Ms. C@@ yn@@ th@@ ia Ken@@ yon is now following this recipe .
this scientist is not a woman of words , and she is actually following this recipe .
we will wait and see the outcome of her experiment .
but some recent studies of nutrition did agree with her method , saying that this method seemed extreme but made sense .
our previous nutritional guidelines , suggesting eating more coarse grains and vegetable and eating less meat , might be wrong .
with the advancement of further researches , some scientists suggest that you might take a particular pill each day and you will then stay healthy .
as for the pills , the most famous one is met@@ form@@ in , which was originally a drug used to treat diabetes .
the design concept of this drug is closely linked to the insulin signal routing line .
the drug was approved into clinical practice by the US FDA two years ago .
the purpose for this clinical trial is not to see how it works against diabetes .
but its role in reducing the incidence rate for people in having cancer , cardiovascular disease , and neuro@@ de@@ generative diseases .
also , I would like to emphasize that the current anti @-@ aging research has never set increase of life expectancy as a key target , to me it is un@@ scientific .
apart from taking these experimental drugs , there is another possible solution to help us live longer and this solution is much easier to be accepted by us .
it is to do moderate @-@ level physical exercise , and by doing so you can produce the appropriate amount of per@@ ox@@ ides in your body , let your body get a moderate oxid@@ ative damage .
it is a metaphor .
you are getting older , and your body will eventually meet a very strong oxid@@ ative damage .
however , when you do physical exercises regularly , as if your body keeps preparing for mock exams , your body will handle the big test with ease , right ?
basically it is so .
but I want to stress that it is a sort of moderate @-@ level physical exercise .
when the physical exercise is intense and beyond the limit of your physical condition , it will produce excessive oxygen compounds , causing excessive damage to your body .
I will add a new point here , only a personal opinion .
I never recommend people to run a marathon or do such sports like that .
I feel that people who run mar@@ ath@@ ons every year are people who have trouble with themselves .
of course in the recent two years , there are more innovative ideas being proposed , and these ideas are totally different from the previous aging @-@ factor knowledge .
one of the simplest innovative ideas is that when you are getting older , more and more cells in your body will enter an aging state .
and these aging cells actually produce some very bad reactions like inflammation .
then scientists come up with the idea of eliminating these aging cells .
as a result , the concentration level of aging cells will remain at a low level .
the solution is indeed innovative , and the result has been proved by researches on experimental white rats .
yes , as long as we eliminate aging cells , we can find a way to combat aging .
we hope that , by carrying out our research , we can help more people , in their 80 , 90 or 100 of age , to stay active and young as these two people standing in front of us , and their old @-@ age life can still be colorful .
thank you .
this is the earth we see from the space .
we can see that the autumn of harvest and the quiet winter , spring and summer come and go .
the whole seasons look shocking in the space of the universe .
hello everyone , I am Zhang Gong , CEO of G@@ ago group .
I will talk about something that is both modern and traditional , that is how to use the new technology supported by spatial data to traditional agriculture .
let me introduce myself first .
I used to work at NASA .
this place is where we used to gather .
if you go to Silicon Valley , you may sometimes see that huge apron behind , which was the world &apos;s largest apron , called Hang@@ ar One .
it is a large hang@@ ar , the world &apos;s largest air@@ ship was in it .
I was there , doing something like using some space technology to serve the ground .
what is it then ?
we use satellites to scan the entire land , to see the plants on the surface , the growth of these plants , and to see how the humans on the ground change the world .
we can see that this is a distribution of the world &apos;s crops derived from satellite images and it is mainly about the density of farming .
are also the area with the most concentrated and dense farm@@ ing.@@ We can see areas like the North America , Europe , and East Asia , where human civilization develops best .
in fact , since ancient times , agriculture has been the most basic way of production and life of mankind .
maybe you will think that this picture is very strange .
it looks a little bit like the British St@@ one@@ h@@ enge .
in fact , this is a device used by ancient Chinese to observe the sky .
this is how it works .
we can see that each line corresponds to an angle at which the sun rise .
each angle corresponds to the solar terms we often talk about , the terms like spring equ@@ in@@ ox and autumn equ@@ in@@ ox .
in fact , the core of solar terms is that they guide the agricultural affairs and farming activities .
why ?
in the 24 solar terms , there are many terms like grain in ear , grain rain .
in fact , the core is that we want to get information on when we should plant and when to harvest by those observations .
because it is important for agriculture to be combined with the weather .
only when a certain temperature is reached will there be ha@@ v@@ ests , and only with the right amount of water can we produce the corresponding crop .
how to observe the weather is always a core issue of agriculture .
therefore , Chinese invented the 24 solar terms .
in fact , the 24 solar terms seem ancient for many people who may wonder whether they belong to a traditional plan of China .
in fact , I often ask some of my friends , &quot; Is the 24 solar terms in the lunar calendar or the solar calendar ? &quot;
many people will think that they are definitely in the lunar calendar .
in fact , you will find that the 24 solar terms actually correspond to the solar calendar .
it is our oldest ancestors who first started to observe the moon phase to count the days .
and more importantly , they found out that by following the cycle of the weather and the cycle of the Earth &apos;s orbit .
people would find out when it is suitable for farming and when it is suitable for harvesting .
actually , it is not only the ancestors of the Chinese but all ancestors .
as we can see , the 24 solar terms is what they called the z@@ odi@@ ac in the West .
the ancestors at home and abroad , they all have to observe the weather to solve the problem of eating , so we often say that &quot; observing the weather to eat . &quot;
although the anci@@ ents have worked so hard to know about these solar terms , the agricultural problems caused by changes in the weather have always plagued us .
because the weather always changes faster and more directly than what we feel .
for example , recently the drought in eastern Inner Mongolia was very serious .
we can see that the ground is cracked like this .
in fact , if we didn &apos;t do this kind of weather perception in advance , we can &apos;t resist such a big disaster .
but sometimes , agriculture will encounter another dilemma .
what is it ?
a better harvest .
this year &apos;s weather is particularly good , or I planted soybeans last year and had a big harvest , then I would plant soybeans again this year .
as a result , people will often see this phenomenon .
no matter what you plant , the cabbage , soybeans , or other kinds of things in the ground , they often piled up like mountains , and don &apos;t sell in the city .
why is that ?
agricultural production is exposed to the risks of weather and fluctuations in price at the same time .
therefore , for agricultural production , these external factors have always made our real agricultural operators and farmers face these large fluctuations .
there are a lot of difficulties .
even for the so @-@ called advanced agricultural merchants abroad , they also have to deal with such fluctuations in production and in price .
here are the fluctuations of some majors grains such as wheat and barley etc .
we could see there have been important fluctuations each year , even every season .
so it is essential for agriculture to solve the problems caused by fluctuations and various risks .
have we got some new solutions in the process of development ?
the crop growth is actually divided into several steps .
we are in the northern hemisphere , we sow seeds in the spring .
then there is plant protection , wee@@ ding , pesticides , and then irrigation , fertilization , harvesting and so on .
this process is accompanied by the usage of new agricultural machines for see@@ ding , pesticides , fertilization , etc . , that are applied to farmland .
then , along with the longer cycle required in this process , we may need loans , agricultural machinery leasing , and even insurance and futures to balance the risk .
because we still can &apos;t completely control the weather now , although we try to change a lot of things , the process is actually very long , and it requires us to work hard for a long time .
there are some bi@@ otechn@@ ologies that have a role in it , including pesticides , new generation pesticides , new generations of fertilizers and so on .
in fact , in the 21st century , especially in the last decade , what is the concept of a new digital agriculture in the whole world ?
from the previous brief understandings of the weather and crops , we have turned to the data of the outside world , to meteorology and satellite remote sensing .
on the one hand , we are able to perceive the growth conditions of ground crops in a better way .
on the other hand , we can make timely predictions about future weather and risks .
by combining them , we could form a more efficient agricultural operation system .
in this way , we can reduce the application of pesticides and fertilizers .
we are able to open up the entire agricultural sector better , more rationally and more efficiently .
then we could form an overall agricultural solution that is more efficient and more risk @-@ resistant .
large foreign enterprises , including agricultural enterprises , agricultural machinery enterprises , and food enterprises , have proposed different solutions .
including satellite remote sensing and Internet of Things and a combined solution of data and crop growth .
two @-@ thirds of the farmland in the United States has now begun to use digital agricultural solutions to explore how to properly irri@@ gate , fertili@@ ze , sow , and ultimately refine every piece of land on its huge agricultural map .
I have been in the United States before , and I actually feel the power of the changes .
this is a farm in the United States , and we can see that it is a flat land with several major crops .
at that time , I was thinking , what are things like in China ?
this is a piece of Chinese land of the same size .
we can see that Chinese land is so broken .
we have come all the way from the small @-@ scale peasant economy .
every small piece of land is divided into dit@@ ches , each belongs to an individual and with various kinds of crops planted .
how to deal with this situation ?
can we improve the efficiency of people who are doing agricultural production on the spot by using this simple method of using some data ?
how to improve ?
this is actually a big problem on my mind , so my companions and I actually thought about this for a long time .
in fact , we were quite confused at the beginning .
how do these advanced technologies work in China ?
can these technologies be implemented on such small areas ?
it is definitely not possible to rely on human resource .
if you rely on human resource , it may be more expensive than the farming itself .
what is the advantage ?
we have a variety of new algorithms now , we can take advantage of machine translation capabilities to understand every part of land in China and the crops on it .
for example , this is a typical land@@ form in China .
in fact , there are some ter@@ races in it .
this is the whole process of computer identification .
we separate each piece of land from others with machine learning capabilities and then , we use the calibration method to figure out the situation of crops on each land .
all of this depends on the advancement of technology .
with the new machine learning capabilities , we don &apos;t have to do it manually .
no matter it is a huge land or like the scattered lands in China , you can attach relevant information to every area you want .
then with such information of the land , we also need to know the information about the environment .
China &apos;s environment is particularly complex .
there are many differences between the North and the South .
I remembered that when I first returned to China , there was a problem .
a seed company especially wanted to know what kind of seeds should be used on what kind of land .
because some of the seeds are particularly resistant to lodging .
as you know , when the corn grows very tall , it is very easy to be blown down by the wind in the end .
if one kind of seeds is better at resisting to lodging , it may be worse in other aspects , such as the resistance of pests and diseases .
how do we spot these features ?
we need a map of the wind field of the whole China .
we will know which part of China has the strongest wind .
we can use other types of seeds there .
in areas where windy hazards are less severe , we may need to deal with other things , such as pests or droughts .
we use these data to help every part of China &apos;s agricultural industry chain , no matter seeds , pesticides , fertilizers , or entire field management .
for example , this is a picture of the development of the pests in China based on actual conditions .
we can find the role of data in each step to help China &apos;s agriculture form a technical base at the least cost .
there are land information , crop information and meteorological information .
we combine all the information to make Chinese agriculture a more efficient model .
we will tell him when it is suitable for fertilization , when it is suitable for pesticides , and when to take the most reasonable harvesting measures .
of course , all of this is actually rooted in the experience of China .
we are also matching the relevant experience of traditional Chinese agricultural cultivation with our own technologies .
and finally forming an efficient and highly reliable agriculture with minimal input .
why is that ?
through the understanding of the external environment and the crop itself .
we can understand the external environment and finally adopt a more reasonable operation method to reduce all possible risks in agricultural production .
but sometimes we are still powerless .
the risk is there , it will always come .
we do everything possible to reduce these risks .
when the drought comes , we try to inform farmers to irri@@ gate early , but the water source may be limited .
this is a village in Inner Mongolia .
we can see that in this land of China , even in the wilderness like the north , the actual land is still so broken .
they experienced a major drought there .
the drought was very serious , and there was not enough water in the local area .
the final risk came , there was no@@ things to be done .
in the end , the farmers had no harvest .
at this time , it is important that we also use financial tools to help them .
if there is risk , we can resist it as much as we could .
after the risk comes , we support them to deal with it with agricultural insurance or related financial technology .
we worked with the insurance company to quickly clarify the corresponding attributes of each piece of land through scanning the ground .
then , we will know which part is seriously affected .
in this way , we can give the corresponding insurance payment directly to the farmers in a few weeks , which will not affect the planting in the next season .
the entire production chain of agriculture is very long , and there are some risks that we can evade , but some are difficult to evade .
at this time , we could take advantage of data .
with a solid foundation of data and combined with insurance , credit , even futures and a series of financial instruments .
we could reduce the agricultural risks of each household , every village , every province , and even the entire country .
we hope that with our data , we can help as much as possible .
it also includes these cute little pigs .
I was mainly talking about the planting , yet there are also risks in the breeding industry .
how is the growth of these pigs ?
can we locate each pig through similar image recognition technologies to see if they are in good health or not , and whether they need to be controlled .
for example , if it is ill , it is necessary to identify this risk early and then handle it .
in fact , we can use one single sentence to express what we want to do .
in the past , we might call it &quot; live on the weather . &quot;
we rely on our feelings and farming experience .
furthermore , we have new data processing technology and sensing technology .
we use data to have better understanding of the external factors affecting agricultural production .
we call this &quot; know the weather . &quot;
with this as a foundation , we could realize more efficient agriculture operations .
the Chinese agriculture is transforming from a small @-@ scale peasant economy to a large @-@ scale economy .
every piece of land , every crop , every species needs our attention .
in China &apos;s agricultural planning process , the data is extremely scarce .
even many of our customers don &apos;t know how much land they have .
it may be hard to imagine that , but in the countryside , there are plenty of scattered land .
so it is often difficult for farmers to tell which part belongs to themselves , how is the planting on each land and how are crops growing .
our future intensive agriculture , which will consist of hundreds of pieces of land .
how to summarize the situation , information and data of each piece of land ?
based on this , how to do large @-@ scale management and form a large @-@ scale and efficient agriculture ?
in the future , we will further integrate a series of financial measures , such as insurance , futures , credit , etc . , to achieve efficient and measurable agricultural production .
we try to eliminate these risks and form a future data agriculture .
speaking of which , I actually thought it was all far away .
why ?
because I thought China is too broken .
China &apos;s basic conditions may be too difficult for agriculture .
but on the other hand , I think this thing must be done because it is so difficult , the whole basic conditions are so fragile that we have to do it .
moreover , the technical foundation is used to strengthen the foundation , and with a solid foundation , we can make more efficient production .
our food problem must always be in our own hands and we should achieve food security through a more efficient approach .
I believe that we can do it through data .
finally , let me show you a video .
we use infrared technology to scan the earliest seedlings on the ground .
these are actually hard to see with the naked eye , but with infrared scanning , the small sa@@ x@@ aul seedlings that were only a few centimeters in the desert , could be spotted .
then local farmers will further obtain C@@ ist@@ anche through the sa@@ x@@ aul , to develop a new generation of ecological agriculture in China .
we have become the representative of China &apos;s sand control , including a new generation of ecological agriculture in desert areas , which is world @-@ leading .
in essence , through the data , each tree , every seedling , and every crop can be better combined with our actual production to produce more sa@@ x@@ aul and C@@ ist@@ anche .
we are on the way .
hello , everyone .
I am Zhang Ji@@ ay@@ i from the In@@ stitutes of Brain Science of F@@ ud@@ an University .
today I would like to talk about how a new nan@@ otechnology could relieve the pain of blindness from people .
of course , what we are offering is just a possible option .
but I hope my report today could raise people &apos;s hope of curing blindness .
human visual system is terri@@ fically sophisticated .
at least 70 % information that we take from the world is acquired by our visual perception .
the light we see first enter the visual system through the eye@@ balls .
light enters the eye@@ balls through the lens and is focused onto a membrane in the back of the eye , called the retina .
there are some red cells on the retina that are called photo@@ receptors .
the photo@@ receptor cell converts the visible lights from outside world into electrical bi@@ os@@ ign@@ als .
the electrical bi@@ os@@ ign@@ als are then converted into other signals in the retina and transmitted to the centre of the brain .
the cells in the retina that are responsible for the transmission is called retinal gang@@ lion cells .
after the brain obtained the visual information , it use the information to deal with various tasks related to visual perception .
basically , all high @-@ ac@@ uity vision are in the charge of mac@@ ula lu@@ tea , this relatively pig@@ mented spot .
mac@@ ula lu@@ tea contains a high density of photo@@ receptors .
when we read , or when we focus on something to get a clear vision , mac@@ ula lu@@ tea is what we rely on .
optic disk is at the back of our eyes as well .
probably , people who drive are familiar with the term blind spot .
the retina gang@@ lion cells need to enter the brain through the eye .
so the optic disk is the point where the ax@@ ons of gang@@ lion cells enter the brain , so there is no photo@@ receptor .
that &apos;s why it this area is a blind spot .
human visual system is actually like a refined video camera .
unfortunately , there are about 160 million people who have lost their sight in the world .
in China , the number is around 5 million .
the 5 million patients can &apos;t sense lights at all , so they live in absolute darkness .
among the diseases that lead to blindness in developed countries , 40 % are caused by the evident degeneration of the photo@@ receptors in the retina .
two groups of people are the major victims .
one has ret@@ initis pig@@ ment@@ osa which is a genetic disorder .
the other has age @-@ related mac@@ ular degeneration , a common disease among the elderly resulting from de@@ generating photo@@ receptors .
when we come to our 50s , 6@@ 0s , or even 7@@ 0s , the photo@@ receptors in mac@@ ula lu@@ tea start to degenerate , which leads to increasingly poor eyesight .
in the end , we may lose our sight .
as the process is irreversible , there is no way to cure the blindness caused by the degeneration of photo@@ receptors so far .
but many scientists are exploring cutting @-@ edge technologies .
there are mainly two innovative ways .
one is targeted gene therapy that aims the blind teenagers who have the genetic disorder .
the main issue that still needs to be solved is bi@@ os@@ ec@@ urity .
because at the moment , we rely often on viral or non @-@ viral vectors to edit the genes in the eyes .
the second way is to employ stem cells to cure blindness .
you may have heard of stem cells a lot , they feature the ability of proliferation and differentiation .
they can be induced and differentiated into photo@@ receptors in the lab .
then the photo@@ receptors will be transplanted to the back of eyes so that hopefully patients could sense light .
however , stem cells have the risk of can@@ cer@@ ization .
without successful control over the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells .
they would keep prolifer@@ ating or differenti@@ ating , thus transforming into cancer tissues .
now that I have ma@@ jo@@ red in physics .
I pon@@ dered whether it might be possible to use artificial phot@@ os@@ ensi@@ tive materials to solve the problem of photo@@ receptor degeneration .
this is the start of our research .
there are in fact a great number of artificial phot@@ os@@ ensi@@ tive materials , among which we are familiar with solar cells .
solar cells not only feature high efficiency of photo@@ volt@@ aic conversion but also cover all visible lights , including the infrared .
inspired by solar cells .
we prepared these gold nanop@@ article @-@ embedded Ti@@ O@@ 2 nan@@ ow@@ ires in the lab .
the nan@@ ow@@ ires have nan@@ os@@ c@@ ale structure .
the two pictures here , the left one shows nan@@ ow@@ ires , while the right one shows the human photo@@ receptors .
it is clear that the form of Ti@@ O@@ 2 nan@@ ow@@ ires is very similar to the form of human photo@@ receptors in the retina .
furthermore , the Ti@@ O@@ 2 nan@@ ow@@ ires have strong light currents of visible lights .
hence , the nan@@ ow@@ ires can effectively convert lights into electricity which can stimulate the cells in the retina .
based on the idea , we prepared a mouse with de@@ generating photo@@ receptors in the lab .
we wanted to test the possibility of using the nan@@ ow@@ ires as artificial photo@@ receptors in this way .
we hoped to observe the reaction of each nerve cell in the retina to lights in the lab .
so we needed to employ some microscopic methods to record the signals of each nerve cell .
it is not a easy job , for the scale of a nerve cell is about 10 mic@@ rons .
if the diameter of a hair is around 100 mic@@ rons , a nerve cell is as big as one @-@ tenth hair .
to acquire the electrical signals from such a tiny nerve cell .
we needed to place a glass electrode with 1 @-@ mic@@ ron or 2 @-@ mic@@ ron points on the cy@@ tom@@ emb@@ rane ,
this is a process that could be done by micro @-@ operation .
the video on the right presents a peak @-@ featured activity .
it is the recorded action potential of a nerve cell when it was stimulated .
therefore , the video records the change of membrane potentials .
each peak means that the nerve cell was excited .
after integrating the retina of the blind mouse to the nan@@ ow@@ ires .
we found out that the nerve cell responded to purple , blue and green lights .
it can be seen that the nerve cell discharged electricity at every peak .
and the nerve cell responded to all the three lights .
after coming to the conclusion , we also wanted to know how much light the retina was able to sense .
therefore , we recorded the reaction of retina cells to the light intensity of normal indoor fluorescent lamps and found out the light sensitivity of the blind mouse was close to the light sensitivity of healthy mice .
in addition to light sensitivity , vision ac@@ uity is another element of great importance that needs to be tested .
hence , during the experiment , we exposed the retina to a 50 @-@ mic@@ ron light spot and a 100 @-@ mic@@ ron light spot under a microscope .
the gang@@ lion cells of the retina efficiently responded to the teen@@ y @-@ we@@ en@@ y light spots .
so we think it would be a very useful technology .
the test on separated retina at the early stage boosted our confidence .
we deemed that the material probably could be used to produce an outstanding artificial photo@@ receptor .
so we transplanted the material at the bottom of the eyes of the blind mouse and observed the function of the man @-@ made retina after 5 months .
experimental animals are not like patients .
we can &apos;t ask the mouse whether it has seen lights .
so we observed pu@@ pill@@ ary reflex in the lab to see whether the mouse has sensed lights .
we all are able to notice pu@@ pill@@ ary reflex .
when we move from a dark place into a lighted one , our pupils automatically contract .
it is the natural reaction of pupils to different light intensity .
we noticed that the pupils of the mouse evidently contracted when it was exposed to lights after we had transplanted the nan@@ ow@@ ires into the retina of the mouse .
thus , to some extent , the ability of the mouse to sense light was restored .
additionally , we also wanted to know whether the signal could be smoothly transmitted to the brain now that the mouse could see lights .
right now , what we needed to do was to open up some brains , which is a common test method in lab experiments .
by &quot; open@@ ning up brains , &quot; I actu@@ all meant that we were to drill a hole on the skull of the mouse .
then , we inserted the metal electrode into the brain of the mouse to record its neural activity .
this is how we did it .
at the same time , we put the mouse in a virtual reality environment to offer it different visual environments
then we observe the response of the mouse to different visual environments .
the mouse was running on a floating ball happily , but in fact , it was running though a virtual passage .
the records on the right show the electrical activity in its brain when it run forward .
to our surprise , having receiving the transplanted nan@@ ow@@ ires after 5 months , the visual cortex of the blind mouse could effectively respond to lights .
the right@@ most two pictures present the data of a blind mouse with transplanted nan@@ ow@@ ires and a normal mouse .
the data indicate that the blind mouse with transplanted nan@@ ow@@ ires could be as good as the normal one in terms of light reaction .
all of the tests above were done on mice .
that &apos;s to say , we found out that trans@@ planting the artificial Ti@@ O@@ 2 nan@@ ow@@ ires into a blind mouse could help it regain light sensation indeed .
we would like to move onto clinical application on the basis of animal tests .
so we are closely cooperating with the ophthal@@ m@@ ologists of Zhong@@ shan Hospital to explore the possibility of employing the material to treat patients whose photo@@ receptors are de@@ generating and help blind patients to see again .
after we published our work , the parents of plenty of patients em@@ ailed me and my partners .
what concerned them most was whether the material could be applied to patients in the future and help them to see .
an Indian couple asked me by email that whether they could come to our lab at Xu@@ ji@@ a@@ hui , Shanghai and talk to us by person .
they happened to have a chance to come to Shanghai .
their daughter suffers from severe visual loss due to ret@@ initis pig@@ ment@@ osa .
I think that as scientists .
we could offer patients a chance or a hope with our work and efforts , when doctors have turned them down by telling them the disease is incur@@ able .
I think this is an aspect that makes our work more meaningful .
that &apos;s all for today .
thank you .
I am Han Zi@@ jun , a clim@@ ber .
now my life is like this : every day I climb on steep cliffs and walk through the dangerous glaciers .
pain and death are all part of the climb .
the poor man lying in the sleeping bag is me .
but every day I &apos;m happy and determined .
I am very satisfied with my current state .
but a year ago , I was not as calm and poised as I am now .
in the past two years , I have been on the covers of many fashion magazines , interviewed by a lot of TV stations , interview programs , docum@@ ent@@ aries , participated in some movies and won some awards .
I think this past period may be a reward to my four years of climbing or a summary to it .
I climbed the first snowy mountain in my life in May 20@@ 13 .
since then , in the ensuing five years , I climbed 20 snow @-@ capped mountains of 5,000 to 8,000 meters and reached the top of Mount Everest twice in 20@@ 16 and 20@@ 17 respectively .
becoming the first and only Chinese woman to do so from both the south and north slopes of Mount Everest .
I &apos;ve also climbed the highest peaks in Asia , Africa , Oce@@ ania , Europe , and South America .
and in the April of this year , I reached the North Pole on foot .
in the coming November , I will travel to the remote Antarctic to climb its highest mountain , the V@@ inson M@@ assi@@ f .
and ski to the South Pole to realize my dream of climbing the highest peaks of the seven continents and walking to the North and South poles on foot .
I call it climbing career for it &apos;s only 5 years long .
it is not a smooth ride .
in 2015 , I witnessed a big disaster and brushed past death .
on April 25 , 2015 , an earthquake of magnitude 8.1 struck Nepal , the largest earthquake in South Asia that had ever happened in the last 80 years and caused more than 10,000 deaths .
on the day of the earthquake , I happened to be in Nepal , in the base camp situated at the south slope of Mount Everest and was ready to climb the Mount Everest .
when the earthquake struck , it was 11 : 56 am in Nepal .
my teammates and I were preparing for lunch in the tent .
when the earthquake came , and the mountain started shaking , all the people rushed out of the tent in horror because we didn &apos;t know what happened .
when we rushed out of the tent , we saw the sky smo@@ thered in white snow nearly covering the sun .
the snow mixed with ice and stones fell on us .
out of human instinct , all of us ran in the opposite direction .
but probably after we ran two or three steps , I felt someone giving me a heavy push .
then I fell to the ground .
it seemed as if stones , snow and other things pounding on my back , it was painful , I had trouble catching up my breath , and I was trapped in pain of the suff@@ ocation .
when I thought I was going to lose my breath and about to die , suddenly it stopped .
when I started to move my hands and feet slowly from the snow , it hurt terribly , but the pain was still toler@@ able .
I knew I had no fractures , so I slowly got up from the snow .
but when I opened my eyes , the scene in front of me completely shocked me .
what you see now is the scene in front of me back then .
my teammates , full of horror , some with blood on their faces , some with bodies in twisted , strange angles , and some sitting on the ground , not knowing what happened .
at Everest Base Camp , which is in fact a normal village .
every year , April and May are the climbing season when one or two thousand climbers from all over the world and those who serve these climbers come and live here for two months 。
turning the Everest Base Camp into an international village .
at the moment of the aval@@ anche , it was a village full of tents .
but after a dozen seconds , everything changed .
all the tents were missing , and the entire camp was ra@@ zed to the ground .
I was very curious at the time , what were my teammates like ?
and what was I like myself ?
so I took out my phone , turned on the front camera , and then I saw myself .
but the moment when I saw myself , it was really awkward .
at that time , my face was full of blood and I was horri@@ fied .
blood dri@@ pped down from the tip of my nose .
but I didn &apos;t sense any pain .
now I think , I was too shocked at that time to realize my pain .
this huge disaster has taken away a total of 19 lives in the entire Everest Base Camp .
my team suffered the most with five members from different countries killed , including a Chinese .
after the earthquake and aval@@ anche on the 25th , we were not able to leave Everest Base Camp and did not receive any rescue .
why was that ?
because the weather was very terrible that day .
as there were fl@@ ur@@ ries of snow in the sky , helicopters could not come in and rescue us .
everyone was trapped in the base camp and as if we were trapped in a lonely island .
many friends asked me afterwards , at that the moment of the aval@@ anche , were you afraid ?
I said , I was not afraid , because I had no time to .
at that moment , things happened too fast .
but the time during which I was really scared of was not the moment when the aval@@ anche came 。
but the time from the end of the aval@@ anche , around 12 o &apos;clock on the 25th , to the morning of the 26@@ th when we left the Everest Base Camp .
because after a huge earthquake , the after@@ shocks would follow .
each after@@ shock will induce aval@@ an@@ ches , large or small .
we were fully aware of the danger , and we were in great fear , but there was nothing we can do .
there was no way you could get away from this .
everyone was consumed by great fear and helpl@@ essness , including me .
at that time , I temporarily lived in the tent together with other wounded people .
every time when the after@@ shocks struck , I could not move in the sleeping bag because of the pain of my body .
I was terrified even by the slightest tremor under me .
I covered my ears and listened to which direction the aval@@ anche came from and judged if it was coming to my direction ?
for every after@@ shock , I was pan@@ icked as if a frightened bird .
this feeling is something that I never want to experience again in my life , neither do I want to recall it again .
the night of the 25th may be the longest and col@@ dest night I have ever experienced in my life .
because all the tents and material supplies were damaged in the aval@@ anche , I had only the thin clothes I wore during the day .
later I found some very incompatible down jackets and shoes in the ruins , and put them on , but I still felt very cold .
at the base of Mount Everest which was situated at an altitude of 5,@@ 400 meters , the temperature could go down to minus 20 degrees in the evening .
so on such a long , cold night , everyone struggled until six o &apos;clock the next morning , when I heard the arrival of the first helicopter .
at that moment , I could really feel the hope of life .
the first day I chose to become a clim@@ ber , the experienced climbers , the mountain@@ eering coaches , and the guides told me that &quot; success , failure , and death are all part of mountain@@ eering . &quot;
but this time in 2015 , it was the first time since I started climbing , I felt that death was so close to me .
I felt that the grand power of nature and the in@@ significance and helpl@@ essness of people in front of it .
so after having experienced this disaster , I feel that for me , it is like a re@@ birth after death .
after returning to K@@ ath@@ man@@ du , I had eight stit@@ ches on my forehead and an open wound .
but when I returned to China , the doctor found that I had fracture in not only my nose but also in my right elbow .
after a series of surgery and half a year of rehabilitation , by the end of 2015 , when I heard that Everest Clim@@ ber Team was r@@ all@@ ying members for 20@@ 16 , I couldn &apos;t sit still .
because I feel that the reason of me not being able to reach Mount Everest in 2015 was not about me .
in order to climb Mount Everest , I had prepared for three years .
I had spent three years training myself , learning mountain@@ eering skills , as well as preparing the funds .
because climbing Mount Everest is not an easy task .
it takes a one @-@ time expense of about 400,000 RMB to climb .
so at the end of 2015 , when I saw the recruitment advertisement , I couldn &apos;t resist myself .
but the most difficult thing for me at the time was not to convince myself , but to convince my family .
I remember in 2015 , when I got home , my mother opened the door .
I was very embarrassed at the time , because my face was full of scars and swollen , with gau@@ ze wrapped around my head .
I was particularly ashamed to see my family , because when the earthquake in Nepal struck , my family was very worried .
my mother could not sleep during those nights .
so when I got home , my mother opened the door and hugged me , and gently pat@@ ted me .
when I was crying in her arms , the first thing my mother said to me was , &quot; Don &apos;t cry . go there when you are fully recovered . &quot;
so when I decided that I would like to climb Mount Everest again , I felt that the most difficult thing for me was to face my family .
and I am very grateful for my family who understood , supported and encouraged me to continue fulfilling my dream when I told them my idea .
so in 20@@ 16 , I chose to start from the north slope of Mount Everest in Tibet and spent two months climbing , experiencing the hardships of altitude sickness , col@@ dness and repeated training .
at 8 : 20 am on May 20th , 20@@ 16 , I finally reached the highest peak in the world : Mount Everest .
when I reached the peak of Mount Everest , in fact , before that , I fantas@@ ized many times my reaction when I climbed to the top , would I cry ?
I remember the reaction of my teammates , who reached the top at the same time .
a male teamm@@ ate kne@@ eled down and k@@ ow@@ tow@@ ed at the top .
and some of our female teammates shed tears .
the moment I stood on the top , I was very calm , and I said to myself silently , here I am finally .
then I looked around 360 degrees and enjoyed the scenery at the world &apos;s highest altitude that was presented only for me .
so after reaching the peak in 20@@ 16 , I felt that I had already arrived at the climax of my life and reached a height that was difficult to surpass in the future .
so various interviews and reports came to me .
at the end of 20@@ 16 , when I saw the Everest Rec@@ ru@@ itment Ad again , a very crazy idea came to me again .
I thought that I wanted to go to Everest again .
when I had this idea , I even doubted if I was crazy .
because for this mountain , I have already paid too much , time , energy , and money .
every climb is very dangerous , as if holding your head in your hand .
but I knew that this time I would climb for myself , only .
in 2015 , five of my teammates were killed in the aval@@ anche .
so in 20@@ 16 , when I reached the top in Tibet , I wore a blue H@@ ada on my neck .
I brought this H@@ ada to the peak of Mount Everest and brought it back .
in October of 20@@ 16 , when I went to Nepal on foot , I left it at Everest Base Camp .
I think this H@@ ada and my 20@@ 16 climb were for my teammates and those strangers who died in the earthquake and aval@@ anche .
I felt that when I returned to Nepal in 20@@ 16 to leave this H@@ ada in the Everest base camp , the story should have been over already .
I think it was about time I let it go .
but when I saw the recruitment for the Everest climb at the end of 20@@ 16 , this crazy idea jumped to me again .
I knew that this story was not over yet .
I must go back to the place where this story began and let it end there .
so in 20@@ 17 , I wanted to do this climb just for myself , and draw a full stop to this story .
so in 20@@ 17 , I returned to the south slope of Everest Base Camp in Nepal .
I remember when I got off the bus , arriving at the K@@ ath@@ man@@ du Hotel , the first person to meet me was one of my teammates , a Japanese woman .
at the moment when the aval@@ anche came in 2015 , the two of us were holding hands and running out together , but because of the aval@@ anche , we were broken apart .
on April 26 , 2015 , the two of us were rescued to K@@ ath@@ man@@ du on the same plane and sent to hospital by the same ambulance .
at that time , my Japanese teamm@@ ate had two broken legs and she was very painful .
in the ambulance , the two of us held each other &apos;s hands tightly to give each other strength .
so when I returned to K@@ ath@@ man@@ du in 20@@ 17 , when the first person I saw at the hotel was my Japanese teamm@@ ate , we both cried .
when we both returned to Everest Base Camp for the 20@@ 17 climb , I lived in a tent with her .
during the break , I saw dense wounds on her leg , extending from the calf to the thigh , like two long centi@@ pe@@ des .
at that moment , I was thinking , what had she gone through in order to climb Mount Everest ?
what was the power that had been supporting her to go back to Nepal ?
what was the power that had been supporting me to return here .
so that two such un@@ yielding women like us could meet here again , hold each other &apos;s hands and restart the journey as if we had forgotten the pain two years ago .
so at the base camp in Everest , we agreed that as we ne@@ ared the top , we could go hand in hand to the top .
it was another two months of long climb , two months of adaptation to high altitude , altitude sickness , two months of hardships of headache , insomnia , inability to eat , two months of hard clim@@ bs and very difficult weight @-@ bearing 。
until 4 : 05 am , May 22 , 20@@ 17 when I came back to the peak of Mount Everest again .
what surprised me was that when I was about to reach the peak , about twenty or thirty meters away from the summit , following my guide step by step , pan@@ ting and silently moving forward , suddenly my hand was held tightly from behind by one hand .
I looked back and it turned out to be my Japanese teamm@@ ate Tou@@ M@@ ou .
at the base camp , we agreed , we would climb to the top together .
but in fact , in the actual situation , since everyone &apos;s speed and physical condition are different , it is very very difficult for two people who have made an appointment to reach the top together to deliver it .
but on that day , we really went hand in hand to the top .
on May 22 , 20@@ 17 , I stood on the top of Mount Everest for the second time .
at this moment , I didn &apos;t cry , and my heart was full of joy .
at an altitude of 8,@@ 8@@ 48 meters , the sun rose slowly from the horizon .
at this moment , the sunrise , such a magnificent scene , slowly unfolded in front of my eyes , only for me .
at that moment , the height of Mount Everest &apos;s 88@@ 48 meters also increased by 1.6 meters because of me .
my height also increased and it was a height that only belonged to me .
three days after reaching the summit of Mount Everest , I climbed to the top of the 8@@ 5@@ 16 @-@ meter L@@ hot@@ se , the fourth highest peak in the world .
everyone may think that I was insane .
after that close contact with death in 2015 and the successful land on the peak of Mount Everest in 20@@ 16 , it was fair to say that I had fulfilled my dream .
and then I wanted to do it all again in 20@@ 17 .
well you might say you have reached the top .
but why did you choose to top Mount Everest and L@@ hot@@ se , two 8@@ 000 @-@ meter mountains , consecu@@ tively ?
for me , since I reached the peak of Mount Everest in 20@@ 16 , I knew that I was capable of doing this .
so when I took the challenge in 20@@ 17 , I hoped to increase the difficulty for myself , gave myself a larger challenge .
I wanted to know how much strength my little body could offer .
so when I returned to Everest in 20@@ 17 , I chose to top Everest and L@@ hot@@ se one after another .
but after I finished in 20@@ 17 , it was not entirely joy to me .
it was self @-@ examination .
why did I self @-@ examine ?
everyone can see in this picture where a man was lying on the snowy ground .
that was , on the morning of May 22 , 20@@ 17 , the day when we managed to reach the top the mountain .
as we were on the road to the top , at an altitude of 8@@ 600 meters above sea level , I suddenly saw this person .
at that time , he did not lie on the snow , but leaned on a rock without his backpack or an oxygen cylinder .
at that time , I thought it might be a corpse , because on the way to the top of Mount Everest , be it the south slope or the north slope , you could see several bodies , people who would stay there forever .
so seeing this person , I thought it might be a corpse .
but when I passed him , he actually looked up , turned back , and gently asked me if I was there to rescue .
it turned out that this person was alive .
I could hardly imagine that in such a dark morning , there was actually a person at 8@@ 600 meters with no guide , no backpack , and no oxygen tank , who was actually still alive .
I didn &apos;t know how to answer him at the time , and then my guide dragged me away .
I followed the guide step by step , but my mind was agitated .
and I kept asking myself questions .
this person is alive !
he is still alive !
so are we just leaving him like this ?
my heart was full of self @-@ blame .
but the next moment , I told myself to focus on every step in front of me and focus on the path under my feet .
because if you don &apos;t concentrate , you may stay there like him .
there is no morality at 8@@ 000 meters , and you can &apos;t think in the same way you think when you are on the flat ground because the places at more than 8@@ 000 meters high are death zones .
if I want to save him , I might need three , four , five , or more people to join me in saving him .
maybe more people will die just to save this one person .
so there is such a cruel rule at 8@@ 000 meters .
when you see someone in danger at an altitude of over 8@@ 000 meters , you could choose not to save him or her .
so I continued to go forward with self @-@ blame deep down inside .
when I climbed to the top and returned to 8,@@ 600 meters , I met this person again , but at that time he was still alive .
after having reached the summit , as our team still had extra oxygen and some members were in good shape , so our team rescued him at that time .
at that time , besides the Pakistani who was in danger , his 19 @-@ year @-@ old Sher@@ pa who climbed with him was also in jeopardy .
so the five Sher@@ p@@ as of our team dragged the two of them down the mountain with rope to the safe zone at 8@@ 000 meters .
such a rescue seemed to be a joyful thing for all , but in fact for our Sher@@ p@@ as and our team members , the rescue would be placing everyone at risk .
because our Sher@@ p@@ as , while rescu@@ ing , could risk falling down themselves .
and if the four team members , including me , provided our own Sher@@ p@@ as to participate in the rescue voluntarily , we wouldn &apos;t have a guide when we climbed down the mountains .
to go down alone for us would be very dangerous .
but I don &apos;t regret it , because when we went to the top of the mountain without rescu@@ ing him , we already were troubled by this self @-@ blame .
so when we were back , we were able to do what we could , to save them , I think it was something that we must do .
in some reports about deaths of hi@@ kers and mountain climbers , I saw this comment .
since they love nature and snow mountains , it might not be a bad thing to leave them there .
but as a clim@@ ber , in my heart , I am timid , I am afraid of death .
I &apos;m a passionate life lover , though , I &apos;ve never thought about dying on a snowy mountain one day .
for everyone who loves nature and mountain@@ eering , only returning alive is the greatest success .
20 days after I reached the peak of Mount Everest , I didn &apos;t get to eat well , take a good shower , and sit on the toilet .
so when I went back to the city , I took a hot bath , ate a bowl of hot noodles , and used the flushing toilet .
that made me feel that life could be perfect .
climbing gives us the chance to face death head @-@ on , so we cherish life even more .
why do we climb after all ?
the famous British explorer George M@@ all@@ ory once said .
because it &apos;s there .
and I think this is the most sensible cl@@ ich@@ é .
why do we climb after all ?
because climbing lets us see the scenery that others can &apos;t .
the photo on the background now is the sunrise you get to see at the peak of Mount Everest , 8,@@ 8@@ 48 meters above sea level .
because of climbing , we can block noise and find the true self .
in fact , every time I climb , the most enjoyable moment is that I could walk quietly in the snow , with only the sound of the wind whist@@ ling and the sound of my feet stepping on the snow .
whenever this happens , my heart could calm down completely .
and I would often let my thoughts flow freely through my mind , thinking about what has happened in the past , or what is happening now , or what might happen in the future .
so I really enjoyed this period of time of my own .
mountain@@ eering allows us to grow in hardship , pain and pleasure .
the more pain and suffering we experience in mountain@@ eering , the more likely I am to feel the sense of happiness when we get back to normal life .
so this is my story about why I want to become a mountain clim@@ ber .
I also hope that you can draw some strength from my story and my story could bring some changes to your life .
thank you .
thank you so much .
before I make the speech , I &apos;d love to clarify that from the next second , what I say is only my personal opinion , which doesn &apos;t represent any organizations or groups .
please don &apos;t over@@ interpret my words later on Internet .
some media came to interview me and after I said some of my personal revel@@ ations , they would mis@@ interpret my words , suggesting to others that I &apos;m a male supre@@ mac@@ ist .
I would say it was nonsense .
I wouldn &apos;t have gone through all these troubles to become a woman if I had ever been a male supre@@ mac@@ ist .
therefore , the following words only represent my personal views .
OK , so now I &apos;m going to talk to you about &quot; the freedom of choice for women . &quot;
are you ready for this ?
here we go .
when the team of Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u found me and asked me to do a speech on this topic , I laughed .
we are in 20@@ 18 , in the 21st century , yet we still need to discuss the issue of &quot; freedom of choice for women &quot; at a Women &apos;s Forum , it is evident that in our mind .
we admit that there isn &apos;t much freedom for women in our world today to make choices .
so today my topic would be very specific about one subject , which is also very direct and straightforward .
that is , do women have to get married ?
a woman has to make tons of choices after she is born , choices about schools , her study , her career , her marriage and family among so many other aspects .
before she is capable of making choices by herself , her family does it in her place .
after she becomes independent to a larger extent , it is still the family , the society or people surrounding her that are making choices for her .
especially when the choices are related to marriage , which is an important choice faced by many women .
in terms of marriage , some people are born marriage materials while some are not .
some women are very sure about what kind of marriage they want while some have only acquired a sense of that only after entering marriage .
but is it a must for every woman to experience marriage ?
personally , I don &apos;t think so .
before I became what I wanted to be , I decided that I needed no marriage .
I felt it was enough for me to have my own stage to dance and observe my filial piety to my parents and teach as many students as possible .
I &apos;ve never thought that one day I would be given the chance to take care of three innocent lives .
it was natural for me to play the role of the adopted mother of three children .
was I ready for it ?
no , I wasn &apos;t .
I was ready to become what I wanted to be but not prepared to be the mother of these three children .
but when they came to me , I couldn &apos;t turn it down and I shoul@@ dered the responsibilities .
with pure guts , I gro@@ ped my way forward with these three children .
now in retrospect , people would often ask , how did you manage to bring up three children ?
I said there wasn &apos;t time for me to think about how I could do it right .
I had no time to think but to move ahead .
I also had no time to consider marriage .
I thought if I earned enough money to hire two n@@ ann@@ ies , there wouldn &apos;t be any problem for me to raise three children in Shanghai .
I thought I could manage it .
so I drove my Be@@ et@@ le , inside which I installed three children safety seats , with my oldest son sitting on my right and my daughter and little son sitting at the back .
when I arrived at the Dance Hall , I would leave them aside with feeding bottles .
then when everything was good with them , I would go to dance .
two hours later , it would be the time to change the di@@ aper for the little one .
after that , I would leave them to play and there wouldn &apos;t be any problem for me to do my own business .
I lived my life this way between 2000 and 2004 , before I met Hans , my husband .
sometimes when I see young people complaining about how hard it is for them to raise even one child .
I couldn &apos;t help myself but joking that maybe people have different degrees of capability to raise children .
you can &apos;t blame them for feeling exhausted to raise one child .
maybe I &apos;m more capable , or I am good at taking action .
but , as a matter of fact , I don &apos;t know how to be a good mother .
I know I should pay all my attention to the children .
that &apos;s to say , if I feel that as a child , it would be comfortable to lie this way , I would let my child lie this way .
they could be different .
so slowly all of it has taught me how to be a mother .
during this period of time , I didn &apos;t feel much tired until one day one question hit me .
how should I answer if my children ask me who their father is later ?
of course , I had prepared dozens of answers .
for instance , their father sacrificed his life during one war for the country and etc ...
I came up with lots of excuses , which I found quite unnatural and unhealthy .
it was at that time that I changed my standard for future partner .
I will admit that when I was single , I had a lot of boy@@ friends .
but ever since I adopted my oldest son , I didn &apos;t do any relationships during 2000 and 2003 .
I would unconsciously refuse to invite any men to my apartment because this would make my children confused .
they would think , this man was here for 2 months and later there was another one .
so who was exactly my father ?
I personally wouldn &apos;t tolerate this to happen .
so I dropped the idea of having any romantic relationships and put all my efforts to raise my children .
that was when Hans showed up in my life .
I realized all of a sudden that Hans was someone to spend your life with , not someone to simply just have a relationship with .
then I realized I needed to find my children a father and at the same time I needed a husband in the family .
so my standard for partners changed .
as long as he was reliable and kind , I would not care about what his social status or anything else .
originally , I wanted to find myself someone stronger than me .
but I was wrong .
I hope that our female friends would not make the same mistake as I did .
if you are strong , you could have someone by your side who is a little bit less strong and makes less money than you .
many girls that are strong , well @-@ educated and well @-@ paid would look for bos@@ sy men that are even stronger and richer .
but these men would normally prefer those br@@ ainless beau@@ ties .
so , for girls that are smart , tough and well @-@ educated , if your boyfriend is tender , kind , honest and they treat your parents well , then just marry him !
do you understand ?
I &apos;m proud to say that in my family , I &apos;ve more socially recognized than Hans and earned more that he does .
I &apos;m the bread@@ winner while he takes care of the family .
my family is like that of the pengu@@ ins .
you know pengu@@ ins , right ?
the female would go out and seek food and the male pengu@@ in would stay at home to baby@@ sit their children .
later the female would bring back fish to share with the family .
my family is like that of the pengu@@ ins , which I &apos;m super proud of .
why can I stand in front of everyone , so radiant , doing talk shows and programs ?
because I have no worries back at home .
when I return home every day , Hans , my husband has taken good care of three children , who are energetic and happy .
the moment I see these children in such a healthy status , I feel that everything I do is worth it .
then there comes the family balance .
people would ask me what my husband does ?
I would answer that he is an ordinary white @-@ collar worker .
he married me in China , so he lives the Chinese way as I do .
it &apos;s a very simple explanation , nothing much to say .
at that moment , I came to the realization that marriage is about whether you need it or not .
for lots of girls out there , marriage is a task they need to accomplish when they reach a certain age .
they feel obliged to get married since their peers are getting married .
or it is a responsibility they need to account for towards their parents , especially when they reach the age when they are deemed to get married .
besides , many people hold a mis@@ conception that being successful in career and looking decent .
if you &apos;re not married , you might as well initiate this project and get it done .
you &apos;d better not .
so I want to advise all female friends that when you choose marriage , you need to offer something as well .
how should I put it ?
no matter what personality you have , either self @-@ assertion or independence .
when you &apos;re facing marriage , just like me , you need to take several steps back .
because marriage is about two people working together to build a life .
so , at this moment , you realize you can make a choice in your marriage .
but , sometimes when you &apos;re pushed into a marriage , you need to adjust your positions whenever it is necessary .
so here comes the second topic I &apos;d like to share with you : to all my female friends , you need arrange your schedule throughout your life .
I believe you all know that I have my own Jin@@ xing Dance Theatre , a team of 20 actors .
there were many young female graduates from dance school who applied to become an actress in the Dance Theatre .
every day when we had lunch together , unlike those people who would persuade them to marry and have babies as soon as they can .
I arranged for them that they would dance for a couple of more years .
she asked me if she could and I told her yes .
she could pursue her dancing career while having a romantic relationship with someone .
if she decides not to get married at the age when she is deemed to marry someone , I would support her to do it without hesitation .
there is no time for hesitation .
you have 2 to 3 years to figure out what you want to do but you don &apos;t get to hesitate for 7 , 8 or 10 years .
this is what we call inability to tell what is important .
I told them , don &apos;t hesitate , get married or engage in a romantic relationship as you want .
if you &apos;ve made up your mind to only have romantic relationships instead of marriage .
just do it and I can share with you all my experiences .
if you want to get married , you should understand that in a marriage , there are a lot of things you need to give up and you can &apos;t have it all .
it &apos;s much easier said than done .
I always put it this way , the happiness of people is adversely related to their desire .
that &apos;s to say , the more you desire , the lower the level of happiness you have .
when I was on a nationwide tour , I discovered that dwellers in many second @-@ tier and third @-@ tier cities who hold lower living standards , seemed to be much happier than their counterparts in the first @-@ tier cities .
Shanghai is perhaps the most comfortable place for me to live .
but , when I went there , I wasn &apos;t used to its fast pace of life .
there , people have high spirits but their facial muscles are intense .
take Chengdu for comparison .
Chengdu is a much laid @-@ back city .
different cities , Shanghai , Chengdu , all have their own different pace of life .
the life pace in Shanghai is so quick that it slowly becomes like Tokyo .
so when the city develops , we would have different standards for success , or the success indicator , which would lead to a lower happiness index .
so in my opinion , whether a woman is happy or not , it is not about living in a fancy house or something like that .
it &apos;s not true .
the spontaneous smile on their face when they are not talking is the real happy smile .
I always say that you can tell a person &apos;s happiness from his / her face rather than his / her words .
if a celebrity tells me during our interview that he or she is living a happy life .
I would think to myself that in reality they are not .
happiness is not something you say all the time .
rather , happy people tend to relish the happiness .
when people keep telling you that they are happy or healthy , there might be some problem .
so , what do I think is the happiness for women ?
it &apos;s completely up to you .
and this is my own judgement , which as I said before , which only represents my own personal opinion .
from the second half of this year , between 20@@ 19 and 2020 , I believe this would be the time when women &apos;s power bursts .
from the second half of this year onward , we &apos;ll witness the demonstration of women &apos;s power in all walks of life .
why did people show such huge respect for women in history ?
because it is women rather than men that help the family get through critical times .
the male audience might not be happy to hear this , but I &apos;ll still talk about it .
men are pioneers because the society is male @-@ dominated .
however , you can &apos;t live without the support and power of women to sustain the social structure .
many years ago at an international women forum hosted in France , I said women had two chances to change the world .
is it to become a president or a premier ?
or to become an important CEO ?
very few women could do that .
but the divine power , or life has given women two opportunities to change the world : to become someone &apos;s wife or someone &apos;s mother , to influence the husband and the boy .
these two opportunities are world @-@ changing .
how many people are successful ?
if we look at the first @-@ tier cities , a majority of su@@ cess@@ ful people are male .
that &apos;s why in such an environment , it is paramount for women to make the right choice .
which career ?
what is the life I want to live ?
what is the marriage I want to have ?
is my marriage for my own good or for my parents &apos; sake , bringing pain to the rest of my life ?
or is it something that make others feel jealous yet makes me suffer ?
it is all about women &apos;s own choices .
so , when it comes the topic of marriage , do women have to get married ?
my answer is no .
you can make your own decision .
you can choose to be a married D@@ IN@@ K .
our plur@@ alistic society has actually given people the right to make their own decisions .
of course , against a cultural background as ours , the social pressure is here to stay .
there is a Jin@@ xing , one in 500 years in China .
there will be no more .
to be honest , if you ask to choose one thing that I &apos;m most proud of so far .
I wouldn &apos;t say how successful I am in the dancing community or in the talk shows or how many followers I have .
I &apos;m not proud of these .
I &apos;m proud of having the opportunity to become the mother of three children .
I &apos;m proud of having lived my life from 19 years old onward the way I designed by myself .
this is my choice .
what about the price I needed to pay for this decision ?
I believe you &apos;ve seen the news on micro@@ blog of my wedding hosted on 18th August .
after the wedding pictures were released , tab@@ lo@@ ids then reported that during her wedding , when the priest preached , Mrs. Jin couldn &apos;t help shedding tears .
nonsense !
I can &apos;t have my wedding in the church because I &apos;m not a Christian or a Catholic .
so I had it in a garden .
who &apos;s the witness ?
my three children .
the wedding needs no proof .
Hans and I stood together , with my oldest son , daughter and youngest son reading the wedding vows respectively in Germany , English and Chinese .
these three languages helped them witness how their parents had brought them up , what kind of marriage they had , which to me is most valuable .
so Hans and I walked into the hall of our marriage hand in hand .
I fulfilled one of my commitment .
so I think marriage is a period of time for two people to adjust to each other .
a choice you make for yourself and you need to be responsible for your own choice .
from women &apos;s perspective , or this might be my personal opinion , it might sound aggressive .
you can accept it or leave it alone .
there are many changes in life , sudden and unexpected changes .
when you become a mother , having this life coming out of your body , even if the marriage is falling apart .
I believe there will be a way , the best way , to protect this child .
many people are reckless about their marriage and divorce , without thinking much about the growing life besides them .
for me , I don &apos;t care about the break@@ up of adults .
I &apos;m thinking about the child .
if this child is adversely influenced , the impact would stay with him .
his understanding of men , women , family or even marriage would change .
and all of these changes take place during the fights between the adults .
when we , as adults , have to make the decision to break up with one another , the protection for the child must be doubled .
so when you become old , no matter how you are , either re@@ married or single , the development of this child is healthy and so is your dot@@ age .
what goes around , comes around .
it works on everybody .
speaking of marriage , why would Hans and I discuss this way ?
my best friends ask me , since I have had so many boy@@ friends , has the idea of cheating on Hans ever come across your mind ?
they did ask me , Jin Xing , has the idea of cheating on Hans ever come across your mind ?
then I would joke , saying that the cost of cheating was too high for me .
after so many years in Shanghai , I &apos;ve learnt how to calculate cost .
how would it be fair to my children if I have cheated on Hans ?
for my children , Hans is my husband and their father .
how could I do that ?
that &apos;s what marriage is about .
you have to take a step back and you can &apos;t have it all .
when you want everything , you will be in a mess and the pace of your life will be interrupted .
so from my personal experience , when you make a choice , alright .
you need give up lots of things at the same time and then you need to be responsible for this choice .
in other words , does a marriage have to be lifelong to be perfect ?
no , it is not .
when our fathers were young , they were living in a social environment where they followed a philosophy of moral rituals , both useful and useless .
but now the society has changed a lot and we have more choices , much more than our fathers .
but , with more choices , there will be more responsibilities .
you have to assume your responsibility for your life when you make the decision out of so many choices .
when there is only one choice , it might turn out to be all good .
however , if there are too many choices , people can be overwhelmed , people would desire for everything but ending up with nothing they want .
what matters is what do you want ?
is it the sense of happiness in the end ?
so , if you are in pursuit of the inner best happiness , you need to give up something and lower down a bit your desire .
be responsible for your children because when they grow up , the happiness they could bring to you are more than that of temporary satisfaction and instant desires .
the only thing I wanna say is that as a woman .
I feel happy as I &apos;m capable of making choices and I am confident thanks to my marriage .
by far , among all the roles I play in society , the ones that make me feel proud and happy the most are the role as the mother of three children and the wife of a German man .
thank You .
hi , everyone .
I &apos;m the Sh@@ ining Girl of e@@ Sports Game .
while deciding on this topic , I asked my colleagues , &quot; Do you think that I sound sham@@ eless with the word &apos; Sh@@ ining Girl &apos; ? &quot;
so I specifically added the word &quot; veteran &quot; in front of the title .
on the one hand , I &apos;m , in fact , no longer a girl anymore .
on the other , it &apos;s been almost a decade for me to grow from an ordinary game player , to a practitioner in the industry , and then to an entrepreneur .
so it is not too much to call myself a veteran .
I remember that when I first entered this industry ten years ago , I went to an es@@ ports competition .
after hosting the event , I came out from the venue .
it was very hot .
I took a taxi .
after I got on the taxi , the taxi driver started to chat with me and we talked a lot along the way .
in the end he asked me , &quot; So many people crowded together in that gym . did you have some sort of stars coming ? &quot;
then I told the driver , &quot; There were no stars . we had an es@@ ports competition . &quot;
then the driver showed a confused look , suggesting to me that he might not understand what an es@@ ports competition was .
so I added right away that it was a type of game .
then the driver looked back at me and then said , &quot; I can &apos;t tell , really , a young girl like you have such a special hobby . &quot;
then , after that , before I got off the taxi , he said nothing to me .
I was thinking , &quot; Is it really a special hobby ? &quot;
in fact , in my memory , many people might not know much about this industry ten years ago .
at that time , playing games was categorized as things for bad children , along with puppy love and skipping school .
therefore , society has many misunderstandings and mis@@ conceptions about playing games and es@@ ports .
but to be honest , I have played a lot of games since I was a child , thanks to the trust and support of my parents .
they did not stop me from doing what I liked .
however , there are indeed many people who see the behavior of playing games in the wrong way .
born in 1980s , I feel that the post @-@ 8@@ 0s and the post @-@ 9@@ 0s generation is quite special .
because most of us in this generation , as you all know , are the only child of our family .
with the improvement of our living conditions since our childhood , people began to move into ap@@ part@@ ments .
living in such an environment made us very lonely .
we either play alone , do homework on our own at home , or during traditional festivals and holidays , we play by ourselves alone or with some adults aside .
it is hard to understand this feeling of loneliness .
or take me for example .
I have many good friends , including my former classmates , my colleagues at work , or the friends with who I cooperate with .
the rest of my friends are mainly friends whom I play games with .
we have played a lot of games together and built a deep friendship .
many people will say that people who play games are not doing serious business .
but what I see is quite the opposite , for many game players that I know , coming from all walks of life , all have a serious job in real life .
however , regarding work , everyone understands that in our real life , we would wear a mask to work and face our own life .
but once they join the game , each of them lets me see their true side , and lets me see their advantages .
so I think that the people who play games are no different from the others .
meanwhile , through this I now come to realize that the largest contribution of playing games or games themselves is to help our generation ming@@ le in the most impossible way .
letting two or more people who might never have any contact with one another res@@ onate , be@@ friend and understand each other .
many people would ask me , &quot; Why are a girl like you are so determined to dedicate yourself into the gaming industry crowded with males ? &quot;
when I entered the industry ten years ago , I didn &apos;t think much .
it was really just because I liked to play games , and to host shows .
so I somehow entered the industry and kept doing what I could offer .
but when I really got inside the industry , I found that the industry seemed to be different from what I had assumed before .
I &apos;ll show you one example .
the first time I commented on a large gaming event , I didn &apos;t know how long it would take .
because our main job , except for commentary , is to make time for the players to debug , that is , to debug the network and machines between games .
therefore , we need to keep interacting with the audience , to talk to them about anything that is relevant to the game , or even some latest news of irrelevant players .
the purpose is to stall and make room for our upcoming players to debug .
as a result , very &quot; fortunately , &quot; during that game I sat there doing the commentary for 18 hours , without eating , drinking or going to the toilet .
as I recall now , I don &apos;t know how I managed to stick to the end at the time .
but I &apos;m happy to learn that many comm@@ enters inside the industry are working as hard as me .
every game is a similar experience for them .
then , with more and more in @-@ depth understanding of the industry , I met more professional teams and some professional players .
I found that every time when I went out and told others my profession .
from time to time , someone would ask me , &quot; So you are in this industry . I have a relative who likes to play games a lot . can you introduce him to play professional ? &quot;
I think people seem to have some misunderstandings about professional players , right ?
as for the professional players I know , they are not just good at playing games .
you might not know that those es@@ ports players , they are more like athletes .
they might spend days and nights practicing one gesture , one movement and in one game or one single practice , they would only use one hero character .
so it is very boring and tedious .
it is difficult to stick to it .
what &apos;s the most important quality that they possess ?
I think it &apos;s the sport@@ s@@ manship and team coordination , the awareness of teamwork is very important .
so after I entered the business , I have had a new understanding of this group of people and the es@@ ports gam@@ ers .
however , there are two things that make me cast some deep reflections on this industry .
the first thing is that when I did commentary on Star@@ craft ten years ago , Chinese es@@ ports didn &apos;t play well in the Star@@ craft . exactly how terrible were we ?
it was impossible for us to win the Korean players .
so how far behind were we ?
the most outstanding and top @-@ ranking Star@@ craft male players in China might be overtaken by amateur female players of South Korea .
the gap was frightening .
the second thing is that there weren &apos;t many contests in China , owing to the lack of such atmosphere .
but in Europe and the United States , in the well @-@ developed regions , in fact , es@@ ports games have already become a regular game event .
our Chinese team made every effort to reach the fin@@ alists of some overseas competitions .
however , as the visa applications were denied , they could not participate in those games .
at this time , as someone in the industry , I would be very helpless and depressed to encounter such a thing .
so when I was in the industry , I told myself that I hope , as a media practitioner , to speak for the industry .
I hope that one day I will be able to stand on a bigger stage and let others learn about es@@ ports in China and these Chinese professional players .
after entering this industry , I am very fortunate that I have met many like @-@ minded friends .
they have worked with me for many years in this industry .
they also taught me what dreams are , what is persistence , and what is worth fighting for .
later when I planned to start my own business , without hesitation , I chose to dedicate myself to the media industry that is relevant to es@@ ports but hardly lucrative .
but it was hard to be an es@@ ports game media at that time .
we &apos;re those who have went through the cold winter of Chinese es@@ ports and the content creation industry .
last year , we suddenly came to the realization that the cont@@ en creation in China was thriving .
last year , we started a new business , dev@@ oting ourselves to content related to es@@ ports games , mainly in the form of short videos .
over the past few years , the e @-@ sports game content was really terrible and with only a small group of followers , it didn &apos;t receive much attention and thus encountered difficulties in mon@@ e@@ tization .
back then , two things left a huge impact on the industry .
the first thing was the emergence of Ri@@ ot Games , or shortened as LO@@ L .
this game has introduced many online games , especially e @-@ sports game , to the public .
the number of audiences who were watching the final of LO@@ L surpassed 100 million .
what does it mean ?
here is a comparison we could do .
the number of audiences watching the final of NBA is around 30 M@@ N .
but the most recent match of LO@@ L , the League of Leg@@ ends 20@@ 17 World Championship , had an audience of 140 millions .
we could see that more and more people began to pay attention to es@@ ports game .
the second thing , let me do a little survey here .
those of you sitting here have heard of or even played the game named Honor of Kings , please raise up your hands .
a lot of you have , right ?
this game , quite different from LO@@ L , has enabled more people to experience the fun of es@@ ports game , making it a nationally well @-@ received product .
besides , it has also developed lots of female users .
I can give you one example .
when we were managing our s@@ ina micro@@ blog 10 years ago .
we saw some back @-@ end followers @-@ related data from either the players or influ@@ enc@@ ers in the industry that suggested the male and female followers &apos; ratio was around 1 : 10 .
that is for 10 male followers , there would be a female fan .
if we check the similar figures of Honor of Kings , the ratio of female followers has grown up to almost 50 % .
what have female followers brought to the industry ?
compared to their male counterparts , female users have stronger demand for communication , conversation and content .
with the female users , then we discovered a window of opportunity in short videos .
meanwhile , some phenomenal short video products began to arise last year , the time spent of users on short video apps has quadru@@ pled during the past one year .
so we believe it would be a fantastic opportunity for us .
and last but not least , I want to share with something that has left me with quite deep reflection over the conversation with one of my friends not long ago .
we &apos;ve known each other for a dozen of years .
as we &apos;re both busy , we don &apos;t get to see each other very often .
so when we met last time , he told me that even though we hadn &apos;t got together for a long time , he often saw my videos .
and every time he saw my videos , he would wonder why I could be so passionate about my career and how much dop@@ amine it would take for me to continue doing this one thing for so many years .
I put it simply , out of interest .
some people might jump out and question , saying that they think if you have turned your personal interests into a job , it is no longer a personal interest .
because they think job is rather repetitive .
I also mul@@ led over this question as a matter of fact .
but there are several things I remember deeply .
I remember back in 2008 when Beijing Olympic Games were hosted , I was still a comm@@ enter for es@@ ports games .
we were notified that it was likely the Olympic Committee would add es@@ ports game as an competition event .
if they did , we would be able to host and comment right at the spot and even report the games .
we were so thrilled at the news , so we did a lot of preparatory work .
we knew that only when es@@ ports games were placed in an international and professional playing field .
would it be more recognized by the society and could it be ever better .
so we were thrilled back then .
but , piti@@ fully , this wish from ten years ago has not been realized due to various reasons .
at the end of 20@@ 17 , almost 20@@ 18 , the Jakarta Asian Games officially included es@@ ports game as one of its events .
then I noticed that my friends on W@@ ech@@ at who had been or still were in the es@@ ports industry re@@ posted this exciting news unanimously .
seeing this , I realized that the people who have chosen to leave or stay in the industry are all very passionate towards it .
I think there is a shared feeling .
if you are just like me , a loyal player of World of War@@ craft , you would feel excited to see the trailer of its last@@ est version .
if you are a veteran of LO@@ L , you would feel thrilled seeing R@@ NG win the world championship led by U@@ Z@@ I this year .
if you are crazy for PU@@ B@@ G , you would be touched by the picture of OM@@ G waving our national flag in your W@@ ech@@ at moments .
if you are just a es@@ ports player like me , I imagine you would share the same excitement of mine when seeing the Chinese team holding our flag and the medals in the Jak@@ ata Asia Games .
those who now work in this industry are particularly proud of it .
at moment of this , I always feel that no matter how old I become , my passion and enthusiasm towards this industry will never die out .
only when you keep that passion to yourself could you avoid turning into someone you hated as a child .
it is the same case with our industry .
we have been persistently doing what we feel passionate about and what is right to do .
I never worry that one day my interest would vanish because it &apos;s always there .
it has been so many years for me , growing from a general player to a practitioner in the industry , to an entrepreneur .
we have also witnessed the industry from being under@@ appreciated to now well @-@ received .
these years are full of hardships .
at the most difficult time , we made huge endeavors .
sometimes when people couldn &apos;t see the silver lin@@ ings , they chose to leave .
I have also asked myself time and time again , &quot; Why would I persist ? &quot;
my answer is ever since my graduation from college , or to be more precise , prior to my graduation , everything that I have now is given by es@@ ports game .
there is no reason for me to leave it .
or in a joking way , what is the difference between me and a loser if I abandon my own dream ?
that &apos;s the reason why I would persist .
now I &apos;ve seen more and more excellent people rushing into our industry and this industry overall is more and more recognized by the general public .
I &apos;m convinced that Chinese es@@ ports would one day become one of the most popular sports events for young people .
e @-@ sports games would also become one type of entertainment for people and one of the most important ways for people to soci@@ alize in the future .
so we will stay in this industry to create more high quality short videos to ensure that this industry thri@@ ves .
that &apos;s what I want to share with you today .
thank you very much !
ladies and gentlemen , good morning .
I &apos;m very glad to be invited for today &apos;s presentation .
I will talk about our reproductive choice and the countermeasures taken by hospitals to cope with the implementation of the two @-@ child policy in China .
we can tell from this slide that China and India are two nations with the largest populations in the world .
let &apos;s make a prediction of their respective demographic situation in 20@@ 50 .
it will spin very fast , and the picture in red represents China .
you can see that there is a black line that keeps moving upward , that is the largest population base .
in the 1980s to 1990s , or even in the 1970s , the majority of people were in their 20 to 30 years old .
however , by the year 20@@ 50 , the population base of China is formed by people at the age of 50 .
in other words , our age structure will change dramatically .
at the same time the pyramid also changes .
there are more people on the top layers on the pyramid .
we now take a look at the pyramid of India .
you might notice that the top of its pyramid is always pointed , and the black line is at a much lower position compared to that of China .
in other words , the population base of India is formed by young people .
therefore , in terms of demographic situation , China will face a much more serious challenge than India .
this is another population related slide .
we can tell that with the increase of the number of years our populations gradually disappear on the top of the pyramid .
at the top of the pyramid , the dark blue represents men and light blue represents women .
there are more elders on the top layers of the pyramid , and most of them are women .
but there are more elder men on the top layers of the pyramid in India .
thus , the population size for China and India is almost the same .
however , China will meet a more serious challenge than that of India .
as of now , the number of elder aged above 60 has exceeded 100 million in China , and China is the only country with that large amount of elders in the world .
that &apos;s why we now classify people below 65 years old as young and middle @-@ aged people , which has been accepted by many places of China .
that is to say , one in every three Chinese is an elder .
there is only one thing we can do to achieve the natur@@ alization of population , which is to increase the birth rate .
increased birth rate is the only effective way to solve the problem of aging population .
we now take a look at the status quo of the reproduction of Chinese people .
take a look at this picture , the area in yellow reflects the newly @-@ born population since the introduction of a relaxed family planning policy .
what about the proportion of this population ?
let &apos;s have a look .
women at their age of 30 , 35 or above 38 gave birth to these newly @-@ born children , and you can tell that it is a reverse triangle .
women above 30 years old , typically above 38 years old , have the greatest reproduction demand .
why is that so ?
because they are economically stable .
their first child might have already grown up , and naturally they want to have a second child .
it is a direct result after many years &quot; family planning policy being implemented in China .
I bet most of you will face this possibility of having a second child , what will be your choice ?
and how well will our hospitals cope with this situation ?
yes , our hospitals will encounter difficulties as well .
today , I am going to give you some professional advice in dealing with having a second child and the challenge encountered by advanced maternal age .
I will make a simplified explanation from the perspective of child@@ bearing age .
women at the age between 15 and 49 are considered as fertile woman .
however , Chinese women at the age of 36 to 49 have the greatest need to reproduce .
our healthcare strategy has to make some necessary adjustments to meet the new circumstances .
what is considered as advanced maternal age ?
is the advanced maternal age all about the age ?
age is a stringent criterion ; however there are other factors as well .
firstly above 35 years old is classified by our obste@@ trics department as an advanced maternal age .
and there is another criterion , and the age limit is above 38 years old ?
what is P@@ G@@ D ?
and what is P@@ GS ?
that is , before the embryo being implanted into the mother &apos;s womb .
we carry out an embryo diagnostic , to see whether there is any chromos@@ om@@ al abnormality or genetic disease .
we will only place a perfect embryo onto the mother &apos;s womb .
this technology is called pre @-@ implantation genetic diagnosis of the embryo .
this technology is totally different with the intr@@ au@@ ter@@ ine diagnosis , and we can have this kind of diagnosis in our labs .
and the age limit is set at 38 years old .
there is another type of advanced maternal age .
for some unknown reason , a woman is unable to conceive after 5 to 10 years &quot; unsuccessful attempt .
if the woman is above 30 years old , we will classify her as in her advanced maternal age , and she must go to see a doctor from time to time .
now there are many career women who still remain single at the age of 30 , and their problem with un@@ explained infertility , if any , is yet to be revealed .
and there are other types of advanced maternal age , and we health care professionals will have F@@ SH and other indicators to do the necessary evaluations ; but we won &apos;t go into further details here .
they need to have a health check at any hospital , and we will learn of their ovarian function .
a woman &apos;s physiological age is not necessarily the same as her ovarian age .
we know that oo@@ cy@@ tes in our women &apos;s bodies will die first , that is , the menopause .
but post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women will continue to live , and women &apos;s average life expectancy in Shanghai is 85 years old .
some women have the menopause at the age of 40 , and our textbooks tell us that it is normal .
a woman &apos;s physiological age is not necessarily the same as her ovarian age , and it is up to he@@ ath care professionals to decide whether a woman is in her advanced maternal age or not .
there are other types of advanced maternal age .
for example , a woman might have one side of the ovary cut off ; or she has undergone radiotherapy to treat cancers .
in these cases , we will call these women at their advanced maternal age .
you can &apos;t wait until you &apos;re very old and decide to have a baby , as your fertility function may have been compromised already .
men also have their advanced maternal age .
40 years old is the internationally accepted advanced maternal age for men .
men also play a significant role in safeguarding the safety of our offspring .
now hospitals in China are dealing with a rising number of pregnant women at their advanced maternal age .
from 10 % in 20@@ 13 to 22.@@ 15 % in 20@@ 17 , in other words , he@@ ath care professionals are facing a serious challenge .
I will share with you this story ; some of you might have learned this story already .
a woman in Beijing lost her only child at a traffic accident , and she decided to have a second child in 20@@ 14 .
she was 67 years old , already sur@@ passing menopause , and lost her natural fertility ability .
she later visited Taiwan and had two embryos implanted into her womb by applying the IV@@ F technology .
both embryos were implanted into her womb , in other words , she is carrying a twin .
she later returned back to Beijing .
it was a major challenge to many hospitals in Beijing .
it would be a tough choice for them .
the couple are retirees , and her husband is even older than her ; and now she is pregnant with a twin .
what is the most sensible decision for her ?
how about termination of pregnancy ?
it is a possible choice for her .
raise your hand if you agree with the termination of pregnancy .
nobody will raise their hand .
those who want her to continue having the babies , please raise your hand .
OK , I see that most of you have raised your hands ; and there are people hes@@ itating .
to me , there are sufficient reasons to hesitate .
how can she give birth to the babies ?
for the point of view of our health care professionals .
she is not fit to reproduce in terms of physiology , psychology and social environment .
but it is not ethical to ask her to terminate her pregnancy .
after having a lengthy discussion , we suggested her to give up one fetus .
it is life @-@ threatening for such an old @-@ aged woman to give birth to a twin , so we suggest her to give up one fetus .
but she wouldn &apos;t listen and insist in having a twin .
we are now facing a real dilemma , as she might lose her life for giving birth to a twin .
how can we make a sensible decision between her life and the lives of her babies ?
I think 100 % of hospitals will choose a humanistic decision in advising her to give up one fetus .
but she didn &apos;t listen .
she kept visiting different hospitals and was told the same .
then there were articles on the papers , accusing hospitals of being un@@ ethical and refusing to offer medical assistance to her .
where is she now ?
she is accepted by a private hospital .
but you can think about it , she must visit a public hospital eventually .
why ?
because a private hospital is not equipped with the emergency rescue capacity as in a public hospital .
but she still refuses to give up one fetus .
who is right ? the media report or the suggestion by medical professionals ?
let &apos;s wait and see .
she is already pregnant for 4 months now , and what will happen next ?
she has lost her chance of giving up one fetus .
as the process must be carried out at an early stage .
when media and medical professionals are locked in stalemate , fet@@ uses inside her body continue to grow .
worse is that we haven &apos;t reached an agreement yet .
we are all worried about her .
what kind of problems is she going to face when giving birth to a child at an advanced maternal age ?
there are four major problems .
what is our biggest concern ?
the he@@ ath of the children .
as we don &apos;t just give birth to babies without considering the health issue .
in average a woman will produce 400 to 500 eggs in her lifetime .
you know how precious a woman &apos;s oo@@ cy@@ tes are .
when a woman reaches 20 years old , 25 % of her oo@@ cy@@ tes are with inferior quality .
when she reaches 40 years old , it is 100 % certain that all her oo@@ cy@@ tes are with inferior quality .
that is to say , a woman will have a sharply decreased fertility function after the age of 35 , or 37 .
natural pregnancy rarely happens to women above 45 years old .
from this point of view , a woman aged above 40 years old is not suitable to reproduce .
I remember the wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair gave birth to a child when she was 45 years old , and the news even became an international headline .
of course , she was the wife of British Prime Minister at that time .
but there is another reason for the widespread of the news .
as it is rare for a woman at the age of 45 to have a natural birth .
we will look at this picture , and the message is very clear .
when women grow older , the risk of mis@@ carriage is very high , take a look at the yellow line there .
the yellow line represents a woman &apos;s fertility function .
it is the natural law .
how about the quality of the embryo ?
I &apos;m a specialist of IV@@ F , and I have seen many embryos in my lab .
my experience has told me one undeniable fact .
when a woman reaches the age of 40 , 70 % of her eggs are with inferior quality , which will lead to the abnormal embryonic development .
the odd for the woman to have a mis@@ carriage is 50 % .
even she beats the odds and gives birth to a healthy baby , the success rate is no more than 3 % to 5 % .
in other words , 100 women undergo the IV@@ F treatment , and only 5 of them succeed .
if the women reach the age of 44 , the success rate will be as low as 1 % .
in other words , 100 women undergo the IV@@ F treatment , and only 1 of them succeeds .
assuming that the cost for each IV@@ F treatment is 30,000 yuan , what will I achieve after investing 3 million yuan ?
only one healthy baby .
it is a heavy burden to the public social spending .
there are other side effects for a woman at her advanced maternal age to get pregnant .
take a look , she will be exposed to the threat of a series of diseases .
the risks include mis@@ carriage , plac@@ enta pre@@ via , high @-@ blood pressure , diabetes , as well as late pregnancy death .
these are all grave risks .
women worldwide are all subject to these risks , and the research findings do not apply to Chinese women only .
conception is the syn@@ ony@@ ms for high @-@ blood pressure and diabetes , which has become a serious problem in China .
in our hospital , 11 % to 12 % of our patients suffer from gest@@ ational diabetes .
it is a major challenge to our medical professionals .
the children of these women suffering from gest@@ ational diabetes are subject to the risk of various metabolic diseases .
the risks are high for women at their advanced maternal age during the actual delivery process .
the risks include prolonged delivery time , fetal distress , ca@@ es@@ are@@ an birth , post@@ par@@ tum hemorrhage , metr@@ orr@@ hex@@ is and birth injury .
and the risked are significantly increased for women aged above 40 years old .
you can take a look at the statistical analysis report .
worse is that children of these women are subject to high risks as well , including low birth weight , premature delivery and increased neonatal death rate .
there are two key indicators to evaluate a country &apos;s status being a developed country or a developing country , which are neonatal death rate and maternal mortality rate .
there is another shortcoming for a woman at her advanced maternal age to reproduce , let &apos;s take a look .
this research was carried out by a foreign research team , and it took a considerably long time to have this research done .
for example , for women giving birth at the age between 25 and 39 , in this statistical table , the number of their children reaching the age of 70 will reach 500 , 300 and 100 respectively regardless of their gender .
however , for women giving birth with the age above 40 years old , look , only 4 children end up living to the age of 70 .
in other words , the lifes@@ pan of children born by women at advanced maternal age is much shorter .
that is why people are advised to have a natural birth when they are young .
it is a natural law .
fertility is always a dominant topic vital to the reproduction of mankind , and age is a stringent criterion .
does it matter for men at his advanced maternal age , say , above 40 years old ?
would that be fine for an 80 @-@ year @-@ old man and a 20 @-@ year @-@ old woman to have a child together ?
his child will be liable to many major risks , including cleft lip and palate , childhood tumor , heart disease , infanti@@ le autism , schizophrenia , aff@@ ective disorder , and reduced lifes@@ pan for female babies .
and these are drawn from some foreign research .
that is to say , there are also problems for men of advanced maternal age .
we will continue examining the contribution made by parents on their children &apos;s deformity .
this picture is very illustr@@ ative .
this side represents mother , and that side represents father .
if a mother is above 35 years old , and the father is above 40 years , the risks are grave for having a mal@@ formed child .
however , if the mother is below 35 years old , and the father is much younger , and the risks are much lower .
the color red in this picture represents the risk level .
according to this picture , we will learn that women &apos;s age will play a decisive role in the health of their children .
and it is fine for men to have their children at an older age , but their age should not be postponed to their 7@@ 0s or 8@@ 0s .
from the point of view of medical professionals , childbirth involving advanced maternal age will result in children with birth defect .
in terms of pathogenic study , these diseases may be caused by chromosome or genes .
besides , we tell from their phen@@ otyp@@ es at birth .
for example , congenital mal@@ formation can be easily identified .
D@@ ys@@ gn@@ os@@ ia , however , is hard to tell , even with the assistance of ultrasound B or the magnetic resonance .
we can only know the truth after the baby is born .
we can &apos;t tell the dys@@ functions at an early stage either , for example , hem@@ oph@@ ilia .
if a baby boy has hem@@ oph@@ ilia , he has no cl@@ otting factor and will always bleed .
it is an abnormal function .
if we apply the ultrasound B technology to do the prenatal diagnosis , we are unable to confirm the dys@@ functions at all .
China now implements a three @-@ tier prevention system to fight against birth defects .
the first tier prevention is referred to public publicity campaign , and now a new technology has been incorporated into the campaign .
which means health care professionals will help select the healthy embryos in the labs .
the second @-@ tier prevention is referred to the health check@@ up involving the use of ultrasound B or biochemical tests .
if problems have been discovered , termination of pregnancy can happen .
for example , if a woman is carrying a fetus with Down &apos;s syndrome .
when we perform the ultrasound B at the 12th week of her gest@@ ational weeks , we can discover that this part of area is particularly thick .
if this area is as thick as 2.5 centimeters , it is likely that the fetus has developed Down &apos;s syndrome .
we will require the pregnant women to have the test on the 12th gest@@ ational week .
if you only show up at the 14th gest@@ ational week , we are unable to perform the test anymore .
why is there such a time @-@ specific requirement ?
because all prenatal diagnos@@ es are time sensitive , you are required to perform a specific task at a given time .
when a given time@@ frame has been missed , some particular cells might disappear for good and the contr@@ ast@@ ographic pictures are different .
and the third @-@ tier prevention is referred to the prompt medical treatment after the childbirth .
for example , a child with congenital heart disease can undergo a surgical operation to cure the disease .
if a child suffers from congenital hypo@@ thyro@@ id@@ ism , we can let the child to take thyroid pills .
by doing so the child can have a normal height and his intelligence level will be the same as his peers .
I have given you a brief introduction to China &apos;s three @-@ tier prevention system .
but there is another prevention method that takes place before the actual pregnancy .
for example , you are over 38 years old , definitely at the advanced maternal age , and you want to have a baby .
you are in fear of having a deformed baby or mis@@ carriage ; then you can ask health care professionals to do the embryo diagnosis .
this embryo has already developed 8 cells , and we will take one cell to do the test .
later we realize that embryo diagnosis can be very helpful to women at the advanced maternal age .
when a woman reaches the age of 40 , 70 % of her eggs are with inferior quality .
it is very likely that she will give birth to a baby with birth defect .
however , she still has 30 % of the eggs with normal quality , so we can help select those eggs with high quality .
a sperm and an egg are taken out of the body and then fertili@@ zed in the laboratory .
we then analyze the embryo .
how can we perform the embryo diagnosis ?
it is a biopsy test and we will carry out diagnosis on one cell , either a chromosome test or a genetic test .
we will give up the embryo with inferior quality .
if the embryo is fine , we will place it onto the mother &apos;s womb and let the pregnancy happen .
what are the benefits ?
it will greatly reduce the number of involuntary abortions .
otherwise the problem can only be revealed when having the prenatal diagnosis at the 4th month of the pregnancy , and a forced abortion will have to be performed at that time .
it is less troublesome for the embryo diagnosis ; and we won &apos;t place embryo with inferior quality into the mother &apos;s womb .
and we can also store frozen embryos .
for example , I may have two frozen embryos .
I used one embryo and had my first child ; then China introduced a relaxed family planning policy and I wanted to have a second child .
I only need to have the second embryo from the liquid nitrogen container .
there are two kids in Shanghai with the age difference of 12 years , but they were embryos that were produced at the same time .
technically they were twin brothers .
in a way our reproduction can take place across time and space .
it now becomes an option to save your fertility .
but there is an ethical issue .
China hasn &apos;t decided how long you can save the frozen embryos .
the limit in Shanghai is no more than 5 years ; however there isn &apos;t such a rule in the international community .
we health care professionals are reluctant to throw away these frozen embryos .
if you come to us to use the frozen embryos 6 or 10 years later , we will do the same thing , and the National Health Commission don &apos;t punish us either .
pre @-@ pregnancy diagnosis is therefore very helpful .
in the past we only have prenatal diagnosis .
by doing so , we can carry out medical diagnosis at a much earlier stage .
when these measures have been made in place , the chance of having a healthy baby is significantly improved , or the odds of having a child with birth defects is greatly reduced .
because of running this project , I won the second prize for the National Science and Technology Progress Award in 2010 .
this is a policy formulated by Shanghai Health and Family Planning Commission , stat@@ ely clearly that the child@@ bearing age limit for men is 55 years old and 50 for women .
actually there isn &apos;t such a policy or age limit in China .
however , for an international metropolis like Shanghai , we have already developed advanced medical service system , and it is natural for Shanghai to set up the child@@ bearing age limit .
I still think it is too late for a woman at the age of 50 to reproduce ; but it is still useful to have set up an age limit .
we won &apos;t allow a woman at the age of 67 to give birth anymore .
actually the best choice for the 67 @-@ year @-@ old woman is not to get pregnant at all .
but now there is the pregnancy and it can be very difficult for us to choose .
thanks to the advancement of science and technology , we have been provided with more options .
the relaxation of family planning policy in China will create more options and new challenges for families , individuals and health care professionals alike .
we need to take active measures to cope with the new challenges , including all our families , individuals and hospitals .
I wish every family happiness and good health to every child .
thank you .
hello everyone !
I am Dai R@@ ong ,
I have a 21 @-@ year @-@ old son who is au@@ ti@@ stic .
people often ask me , &quot; How does it feel to be alongside an au@@ ti@@ stic child as he grows up ? &quot;
I &apos;d like to compare it to a journey .
you might have made your travel plans and got yourself quite ready for a journey to Italy , a place you have long dreamed of .
you might even have learned a few Italian words .
you might dream about going to Rome , visiting the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um and David of Michel@@ angel@@ o , or possibly , a Gon@@ dol@@ a ride in Venice .
however , after you get off the plane , the steward@@ ess says , &quot; Welcome to the Netherlands . &quot;
&quot; the Netherlands ? &quot; you might ask , &quot; I am supposed to be in Italy ! &quot;
they may tell you that you have no choice , for the flight has changed the route .
so you find yourself stuck in an alien place , having to learn a new language and adjust to all kinds of unknown circumstances .
you might b@@ emo@@ an your un@@ fulfilled dream .
but instead of indul@@ ging in woe and lam@@ entation , let &apos;s react in another way .
let &apos;s start to learn again and try to adapt ourselves to the Netherlands .
and then you might be amazed by the beauty of this country , its wind@@ mills , tu@@ lips , and the paintings of R@@ emb@@ rand@@ t .
the lost dream still feels like an un@@ yielding , piercing sting , yet the beauty of the new country helps you heal .
my son was diagnosed with autism when he was less than three years old .
I remember walking in calm out of the clinic with my husband .
but as soon as I returned to our car , I flo@@ pped down and w@@ ailed , clas@@ ping my son in my arms .
during the following three months , every morning I found my hair all over my bed and pil@@ lows .
then I handed in my resignation , and my boss said , &quot; Well , I &apos;ll give you one year to recover . this position will always be yours . &quot;
for three months after that , I was learning , visiting more experienced parents , traveling to Beijing and Shenzhen .
I attended whatever classes there were in Guangzhou .
I only wished that I could live a day longer than my son .
there were times when I got so desperate that , looking at my son &apos;s handsome face .
I would pray in my heart that I would give out my life to have his health back in return .
but I knew that wouldn &apos;t happen .
so , like a traveler who finds himself in the Netherlands , I told myself to just face it .
I became very busy in learning all kinds of knowledge about autism .
learning made me forget temporarily the pain and sadness .
it took me one year to adjust myself and finally recover from the pain .
armed with some specialized knowledge , I learnt to face the autism and the therapeutic interventions .
although autism is incur@@ able , un@@ trac@@ eable and a life @-@ long disease , painful as it may sound , there are still two options for us facing it .
we could face it with negative feelings , but that won &apos;t do any good to my child and my family .
but if I face it with positive mentality , there may still be a chance .
I survived and adapted well , and one year later , I went back to work .
there is an organization named &quot; Guangzhou Yang@@ A@@ i Club For Paren@@ ts of Children With Special Ne@@ eds , &quot; whose slogan is &quot; Who takes care of those taking care of others ? &quot;
the au@@ ti@@ stic children , in fact , live in a world only known to themselves .
who suffer the most from that ?
their parents and family .
in this parents club , I met a group of fellow parents suffering just like me .
we could stay together and warm each other &apos;s soul , we could take break and exchange many useful suggestions .
the more experienced parents would help me prepare in advance for what might happen in future .
we , the new travellers , could just follow their path .
United in this parent group , we could then let our voice heard by the society and the public , win their sympathy and tolerance .
we could even bring about political changes and make the society more tolerant towards this group .
when my son was old enough to go to primary school , we paid a visit to Professor Z@@ ou Xia@@ ob@@ ing .
he said my son had high function@@ ning autism and suggested that he should go to a normal school and learn to ming@@ le .
however , when I asked my fellow parents for advice , they told me that our children would usually be &quot; emb@@ att@@ led &quot; in 3rd or 4th grade .
what does that mean ?
it means that in an ordinary school , when the time comes , my son will either no longer bear it or be disp@@ elled by others .
so we , a bunch of super mothers , with the help of the Children &apos;s Palace , the special education centers and public schools .
launched a philanthrop@@ ic program that helped au@@ ti@@ stic children fit into the life of normal schools and provided well @-@ rounded support for them along the way .
meanwhile we appealed to all the teachers and students at school for an inclusive education .
it was Yang A@@ i Paren@@ ts Club that led us out of that darkest period and helped us face the reality and finally accept ourselves and our children as we were .
we are also making efforts to push forward policy changes , whether in education , employment or elderly care .
Yang A@@ i currently has 16@@ 72 members , half of whom are parents of au@@ ti@@ stic children .
how shall we handle it when we have a mentally retarded , au@@ ti@@ stic child ?
we must ask for help and seek treatment .
with the help of the professionals and our own efforts , we will know how to help ourselves and one day we may even be able to help others .
many of Yang A@@ i &apos;s parents are now able to help younger fellow parents or other parent groups to grow together .
and we must also appeal to the society and the government for more favorable policies concerning au@@ ti@@ stic children and their parents .
in 20@@ 14 , initiated by Ms. Wang Xia@@ og@@ eng , 17 parent groups from across China established the National Association of Paren@@ ts with M@@ entally Ret@@ ar@@ ded Children .
so far this parent union has gathered 127 parent groups and extended into over 70 cities and regions across China .
this parent organization that united 127 org@@ n@@ izations like Yang A@@ i is called &quot; Inte@@ gre@@ ated China . &quot;
created in 20@@ 14 and officially starting to operate in 2015 , the &quot; Integrated China &quot; project has benefited over 200 thousand families with a mentally retarded child .
the map on the screen shows the 76 cities in China we cover .
as the parents of a child on the spectrum , the efforts we could make on our own are limited .
but if thousands of such parents are united , we could then support and warm each other .
we will be so closely tied to each other that we will no longer be a lone star , but a constellation , or even a galaxy .
take my son for example .
he benefits a lot from the inclusive education .
thanks to the inclusive education and the help of &quot; Integrated China , &quot; he was not emb@@ att@@ led , but mirac@@ ulously completed his primary school courses .
then , mirac@@ ulously again , he graduated from the junior high school .
later , with our efforts , the Guangzhou government created a special education class in vocational high schools .
my son was then lucky enough to continue his study for another three years .
imperfect as he is , my son can still have a great life .
you can see him on the screen cooking , taking care of himself , doing house chores , doing the laundry and washing the dishes .
he is also a happy delivery courier , delivering packages every day .
for two days every week he will help people wash their cars .
he is good at using all the public facilities in our neighborhood .
he can take a bus by himself to get a haircut .
he likes drawing his own favorite pictures .
because we can accept our im@@ perfection and the im@@ perfection of our child , we could live with autism .
autism is like an essential part of our body .
it is like the five fingers of different length .
it is like in a forest , besides the tall trees , there are also low @-@ lying sh@@ rub@@ ber@@ ies .
autism for us is just a special existence of life in a different form .
let us talk about the inclusive education .
people may think that it is exclusive for children with special needs .
that &apos;s not true .
what is the true significance of an inclusive education ?
to make quality education accessible to every child .
I remember hosting a reciprocal party for the inclusive education when my son graduated from his primary school .
I invited all his classmates , their parents and the teachers .
&quot; thanks &quot; was the most @-@ frequently @-@ said word that day .
we thanked our guests , and they also thanked us in return .
why ?
the teachers said that they wanted to thank Zhang Jun@@ qi , for without him , they might never realize that education could actually be so personalized and personality could be ad@@ ressed .
they have realized that life could have such diverse forms .
with an au@@ ti@@ stic classmate around , the students in their class also ended up being more understanding .
the parents agreed with the teachers , saying that their children had become more tolerant .
compared with the other classes , this class had stronger bonds .
so we insist that the inclusive education will benefit not only children with special needs but also the normal ones .
suppose there is a normal kid who wants to become an architect when he grows up .
if in his childhood he ever played with a child in a wheelchair , or if he lived or studied together with a visually disabled child .
then barrier @-@ free facilities would naturally come to his mind when he designs buildings in the future .
there is a chance for every one of us to have special needs one day .
maybe we will fall and find the barrier @-@ free facilities necessary .
or maybe our sight or brain will deteriorate when we get old .
so when we are creating an inclusive environment , we are actually helping ourselves .
it is by such inclusive efforts , step by step , that our society is getting more civilized and developed .
I wish everybody here today could join us in pushing forward the social integration , in helping those mentally retarded and disabled people better fit in .
and in helping them live a more dignified and more valuable life .
thank you .
we can tell AP@@ U &apos;s im@@ perfection .
we met each other back in 1984 .
I was then a college student and just graduated from Arts School .
AP@@ U was new to the Children &apos;s Palace to learn drawing .
from then on , 34 years have passed .
AP@@ U has what we call moderate mental retard@@ ation .
so far , AP@@ U has created around 4@@ 100 works , 2000 of which are relevant to classic music .
now let &apos;s talk about AP@@ U .
when such a special kid came to the Children &apos;s Palace 34 years ago , it never came across me that 34 years later we would have such a thing called special education or inclusive education .
well , perhaps I was the first teacher who had to deal with children with special conditions .
when AP@@ U was born , he couldn &apos;t open his eyes and nor eat milk , his body was weak .
facing a baby like him , his parents really hoped that some divine power could come down and save them .
in the picture down below , you can see me on the left side and AP@@ U on the right side .
there was the large painting .
he painted with his tiny figure , waving his brushes .
you could tell that he is really talented .
20 years ago , when AP@@ U published his first album , we founded an Art Experimental Class for Children With Special Ne@@ eds .
we recruited a dozen of children , some had cerebral pal@@ sy , some with autism or Down &apos;s Syndrome etc . they were kids with special needs .
we taught these children on a voluntary basis , including AP@@ U .
it was our hope that through an example like AP@@ U &apos;s , we could encourage children with special needs to express themselves through arts .
therefore , in 2006 , when we finished the construction of the 2nd Children &apos;s Palace , we founded the Center of Special Education to provide specific services for these children .
in 2010 , we received the financial support from lottery institutions .
from then on , every year we would provide 2000 non @-@ profit tuition @-@ free degrees to social candidates .
so far we have provided altogether 15@@ 000 free degrees .
we &apos;re grateful for the progress from just a dozen of children to around 2000 children with our degree .
thanks to AP@@ U who had inspired us to help children like him , we have gone far to where we are now today .
currently we have opened over 60 art education courses and we could provide the door @-@ to @-@ door service .
for instance , we could provide arts courses or music courses to children in hospital , such as the ward for cancer patients in a Guangzhou hospital , both regularly and ir@@ regularly .
we also deliver art courses in welfare house .
our goal is that all children could play to their full strength .
every child is unique .
we hope they could become the best version of themselves .
in 20@@ 14 , we founded our In@@ clu@@ sive Art Group .
I &apos;ll play an introduction video so you can know our group better .
our children &apos;s palace has been working on special education for 20 years , now we witness a harmony between the kids , with or without a condition , they get along with each other very well .
every time when I see this picture and notice how they get along with each other so well , I feel happy from the bottom of my heart .
let us take a look .
over the last couple of days , I sorted out the video materials TV stations have shot for AP@@ U .
this one was made 30 years ago by Art gall@@ ary Program of Guangdong TV station when AP@@ U was just 10 years old .
he was really into drawing .
back then he could still walk like all the others .
and another video shot by Oriental Hor@@ iz@@ on Program of CCTV 20 years ago .
then he had shown severe mental retard@@ ation .
he was then working on his album .
his mother who was still very young , spoke of her concern with a lum@@ py throat and cried in tears .
20 years have passed .
now AP@@ U &apos;s mother is a grey @-@ haired woman .
she went through a knee surgery and has trouble walking , suffering from all sorts of ail@@ ments .
AP@@ U has had a hard life .
for example , he has to wear catheter to ur@@ inate .
so it causes a lot of inconvenience for him to go out .
every year he needs to go to the hospital to go through a bladder aug@@ mentation .
life is full of ups and downs .
so his life is basically filled with drawing , medication and rehabilitation surgery , time after time .
it is not convenient for him to go out , for the difficulty in ha@@ iling a taxi .
for the parents whose child with walking issues , especially those with celebr@@ al pal@@ sy , they see their child growing up by days and themselves aging at the same time , it becomes more and more difficult for them to carry their child .
the day will come when they couldn &apos;t do it anymore .
at that time , a common experience for parents in difficulties is that even taxi drivers would ignore them .
but what I &apos;m trying to say is that we might experience what they have experienced .
why ?
because we all will age one day and one day we will be seated in a wheelchair .
my parents , one at the age of 80 and another at the age of 90 .
they have been sent to hospitals .
as I watch them aging , I can feel that my body is aging as well .
sometimes I have trouble moving around or feel pain in my knees .
I can &apos;t say for sure that I will never sit in a wheelchair .
so maybe one day when I &apos;m old , I will need to sit in a wheelchair just like AP@@ U does or I might need mobility aids .
so now we go back to our 20 years &apos; efforts in education for children with special needs and inclusive education .
what I really want to say is I feel immensely grateful for those children and their families , for their parents .
it might seem that for the past 20 years , we have provided a lot to them , such as the number of degrees or the amount of resources , we provided opportunities to these children to speak up in front of the public and to show their presence and talents .
but I believe it is these children that have given us the opportunities to re@@ discover our compassion towards people and to love people as we love ourselves .
it seems that we are helping them , but in fact , we are also helping ourselves .
none of us can say for sure that we won &apos;t end up holding a cane or sitting in a wheelchair .
I &apos;m dedicated to inclusive education simply because one day when I get old , when I call a taxi sitting in a wheelchair , the taxi driver wouldn &apos;t choose to ignore me .
I would like to wrap up the speech with two lines I wrote a long time ago .
to sugar baby , whose name I still don &apos;t know , it is so good to see you .
that day , the tiny and soft you ran towards me , hugged and kissed me .
the sudden trust and love , as if a beam of warm sunshine , cleared away all the pain or sadness inside my heart .
at that very moment , you were so strong that you could save and complete the world that lacked love .
according to the so @-@ called social standards , people would think of you as a def@@ ected or even useless person .
it is good to have you , children of the Art Group .
one day in a crowd , I saw one secretary of our art group pushing around his friend in a wheelchair and we passed each other .
that beautiful scenario was forever engraved in my mind .
we &apos;re here today mainly for one purpose , to discuss one concern , the concern of AP@@ U &apos;s mother &apos;s for herself , for AP@@ U , or our shared concern for one day ending up in the wheelchair when we get older .
but now the concern will no longer exist .
because we will love others the same way we love ourselves .
when people warm and protect each other , when people love each other , will it be long before we form a united community of destiny ?
because with each other &apos;s love , there will be no worries nor fear .
I believe this is the most important significance of inclusive education .
thank you all !
hello , everyone .
my name is Wu Zheng@@ dan , the creator of the &quot; ballet on the shoulder . &quot;
from 6 to 16 , I am an athlete .
this period should have been the happiest moment in my childhood .
but that &apos;s for other children , not for me .
when I was 6 years old , I only did the most basic thing , which is enduring pains every day .
however , this has laid a great foundation for me .
I have a very good physical state and quality , as well as an excellent elasticity .
these qualities are essential for me becoming a dancer like myself today .
for some reasons , I was eliminated and sent the team of acrob@@ atic gymnastics , which is still a sport .
when I was 6 , I met my partner .
at that time , we didn &apos;t know that we would be a pair and now he is my husband .
by coincidence , we were arranged by the coach to become partners , for the mixed pair program in acrob@@ atic gymnastics .
I was so afraid that he might bully me or even beat me .
when I first met him , I told him that I would not practice with him unless he agreed to three rules : first , he was not allowed to beat me ; second , he was not allowed to shout at me ; third , he was not allowed to drop me .
why did I mention being dropped ?
because some acrob@@ atic movements are performed high above the ground .
I will be lifted up into the air .
if the base performer is not happy , the one on the top may be dropped .
he accepted my conditions and kept his promise .
we worked together as a mixed pair since 1992 .
he is still my partner , and also my life partner .
during a competition in 1996 , when I performed s@@ omer@@ sa@@ ult on his shoulder , I slipped , fell and hit my head on the floor .
I nearly repeated S@@ ang Lan &apos;s accident .
nevertheless , the accident became a turning point .
it was my great honor that our performance impressed leaders of Sol@@ dier Acrob@@ atic Trou@@ pe of the Political Department of Guangzhou Military Region .
they invited us to Guangzhou where I started a new career .
I had never thought of becoming an acrob@@ at .
when I came to the Sol@@ dier Acrob@@ atic Trou@@ pe , I didn &apos;t have a clue about my future .
during the trou@@ pe &apos;s global tour , we performed only the acrob@@ atic mixed pair program .
with a slight rec@@ asting of a previous work , it was showed to the foreign audience .
a very famous ballet master , who was also the Arti@@ stic Director of the Royal Danish Bal@@ let , watched our performance .
he commended that , &quot; These two performers were so beautiful that they danced like the prince and princess of ballet . &quot;
his comments inspired me .
I began to wonder if I could wear a pair of point@@ e shoes .
so , I wore the shoes and started the first step -- standing on the floor and rising up on my toes .
however , standing on the tips of my toes was barely enough .
by no means could I dance as well as professional ball@@ er@@ in@@ as .
after all , they started the ballet training when they were 10 .
at that time , I was already 20 years old .
when we composed &quot; ballet on the shoulder , &quot; I did not know where I could stand .
I found the best spot gradually , by stepping on the body of my partner , my husband .
I left my footprints on almost every inch of his skin .
he just laid on the ground and let me step anywhere I wanted .
it was a painful journey .
we wanted to combine acrob@@ atics with ballet , but how ?
the only choice is through the body , by standing on his body .
but we had no idea where I could stand .
we had to try , finding the largest area of his body .
our first option was the back of my partner .
but that didn &apos;t seem exquisite enough , so how did we do ?
I decided to stand on the shoulder .
but on which part of the shoulder ?
standing here , or there ?
after thousands of experiments , we believed only this part of muscle was large enough to stand without touching his bone .
so , we finally decided to try this part of shoulder .
but this place , as you can see from the picture , was so difficult to stand that I would surely fall off if missing only one milli@@ meter .
every day , I failed and tried again .
why do I show this picture ?
this is the shoulder of my husband .
every day it was seriously bru@@ ised , because I had to spin and turn around repeatedly with toes on his shoulder , constantly producing fric@@ tions .
the top of my point@@ e shoes was covered with blood and pus .
in Guangdong where the weather was remarkably hot , the day after I finished practicing , a thin layer of sc@@ ab formed on my husband &apos;s shoulder .
but the sc@@ ab would be soon screwed off by my first ballet movement on the second day .
but we kept working on it day after day for hundreds , if not thousands , of times .
why was that ?
the physical pain was no big deal for me .
because physical injuries were common among actors and athletes . we were able to bear the pain .
even if I broke my feet , I could perform immediately after the nerve block injection .
what we feared most was the feeling of loss and confusion .
why ?
because we did not have any directions .
no coach could tell me whether I was doing good or wrong .
I didn &apos;t know the skills nor technical requirements .
I didn &apos;t have any ready solution to the problems .
I did not know what made my movement good or what was wrong with my bad movement .
every day we were immersed in confusion .
although we were already in a relationship , we almost broke up for this work .
every day , we argued , disagreed , quarrel@@ ed and complained to each other .
success was something we all desired , but we did not know where to head for .
we were not sure of how the work was going to be like .
during our preparation , everyone would confronted us with , &quot; Are you going to disgrace ballet ? are you going to sub@@ vert ballet ? &quot;
we really didn &apos;t know what would happen .
that was the sc@@ ari@@ est thing during that period .
now , I feel so lucky that we stick to it .
no matter what difficulties we met , the one that paused the work or the one made me nearly quit , we persev@@ ered and finally made it .
later , we also tried ballet on the head .
we tou@@ red in many countries for performance .
I had imagined the success , but I never thought of such a huge recognition and acknowledgement .
as a Chinese performer , with the current context , my performance has attracted people from different places around the world , I felt very proud as a Chinese performer .
I created the chore@@ ography in 1998 and won the prize in 2002 .
during the four years in Guangzhou , we had no friends .
I came here with my husband , from Liaoning Province , the northeastern part of China , and we practiced for 10 hours a day in the rehearsal room .
in retrospect , I think it was a very hard time , but I am very proud for my perseverance .
I am very very lucky , because not everyone att@@ ains success with hard work , but I won the recognition .
besides , I have done something that I am good at .
I have all the favorable conditions to show my talents , my values and advantages .
I have great passion for my job .
it has become a hobby of mine and I enjoy it .
I am nearly 40 years old , but I am still on the stage .
sometimes , I feel a little bit tired , but this kind of ti@@ redness is bitter@@ sweet to me .
I enjoy the work I am doing .
thank you !
this is the feedback from some of our audience during our performance .
we participated in 30 consecutive performances at the Shanghai Grand Theatre .
few programs in China could achieve this -- we received standing ov@@ ations for every performance .
I will tell you the truth .
every time before I entered the stage or standing on the stage , I was so tired and overwhelmed by the non @-@ stop work , that I hoped the stage lights could go out .
I hoped that the stage was out of light for a whole day or some accident occurred , so that I could stop performing .
I had such illusion .
but when I stood on the stage and started to perform .
I was still dedicated until the last minute .
after the 1.5 hours show , when I took a bow to the appl@@ au@@ ding audience , I thought it was all worthwhile .
I really enjoyed the moment when I was met by standing ov@@ ations .
at the moment , all the ti@@ redness disappeared in an instance .
that was the happiest time of my life as a performer .
up until now , I am still passionate about the stage and the peak of my career lasted until 2008 .
I fell from the peak of my career because of an accident , my pregnancy .
it should be a good thing .
but for a performer , especially when I was at the peak of my dancing career , I was not prepared to be a mom .
after giving birth , my body was out of shape .
all my train@@ ings in past were in vain .
I was not able to stand on the stage as perfectly as before .
getting back in shape was hard for me . I still remembered the hardships as if they happened yesterday .
even though it was 37 Celsius Degree in Guangzhou , wrapped in plastic wrap and putting on clothes for weight loss , I spent one hour on running every afternoon .
I ate food on a scale .
no matter how many dishes were on the table , I only had five bites of food and walked away .
because only in this way could I lose weight rapidly .
my love for the job , at that time , turned into obsession .
why was I so eager to recover my body shape ?
because I found myself falling in to a state of depression .
because I truly felt that in the past 20 years , I only did one thing , that was performing on the stage .
I found that I was not good at any other things .
only by performing could I show my value .
therefore , I really hoped to get back on the stage as soon as possible .
my waist , my entire lumbar spine , was not as flexible as before .
but there is a benefit of taking a long break .
I found that sometimes in life , you will become better , but not necessarily on@@ stage .
the one year &apos;s break gave me another reward .
my life and stage experience were refreshed .
I had different feelings .
when I expressed myself through dance , the emotions , ideas and the message I conveyed to the audience were totally different .
people told me , &quot; Zheng@@ dan , you have elevated to a new level . you have made progress again . &quot;
so , I think a person at different periods in his life will gain different things and go through different feelings .
I find that skills could improve naturally after a certain age , but you have to wait until it comes .
this is my experience .
then I got back to the stage and won the Gal@@ ina U@@ lan@@ ova Prize in Russia .
this reward is very precious to every dancer .
I am an acrob@@ atic performer or more precisely , a cros@@ sover ballet dancer .
I am very proud that I can receive the honor and I really cherish it .
now I am not only a performer , but also a keeper and a torch @-@ pass@@ er of the art .
my responsibility and obligation are to pass &quot; ballet on the shoulder , &quot; the miracle and technique created by the Chinese , to the next generation , so that the art is kept alive .
besides , I have trained many little friends .
I hope their dream could come true and I am ready to give a hand .
I also believe , dance learners are the most dedicated and hardworking people .
they will succeed in everything they do .
to summarize , the perfection that we will never reach but never give up pursuing is the charm of ballet .
&quot; ballet on the shoulder &quot; occupies the first half of my life and I am grateful for this amazing encounter .
standing on the stage , on the shoulder of my husband , makes me feel very proud .
at that moment , I feel very powerful and all @-@ conqu@@ ering .
thank you !
good afternoon , everyone .
I &apos;m Ge Y@@ ao@@ ji@@ u , I &apos;m from a &quot; bridge building family . &quot;
don &apos;t be mistaken .
my father and my grandfather are not bridge engineers , but my mentor , and the mentor of my mentor are internationally recognized experts of bridge engineering .
we three are all from Tong@@ ji University , I would say that Tong@@ ji University is the bridge building family and the birthplace of China &apos;s first bridge engineering discipline .
I would like to first introduce my mentor &apos;s mentor , Li Gu@@ o@@ hao .
before the founding of PRC , Li had obtained his doc@@ torate degree in Germany and decided to return back to China .
he established China &apos;s first bridge engineering discipline at Tong@@ ji University in 1952 .
after the Cultural Revolution , Li was selected as the President of Tong@@ ji University and later became a Hon@@ orary President .
he was a member of both the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the China Academy of Engineering , and served as Chairman of the Shanghai Science Association and the Shanghai CPPCC .
my mentor , Xiang Hai@@ fan , is Professor Li Gu@@ o@@ hao &apos;s first postgraduate student .
he was among the first batch of Chinese students to win the German Hum@@ bol@@ d@@ t Fund and to study in Germany after the Cultural Revolution .
upon returning from Germany , he set up China &apos;s first Department of Bridge Engineering in Tong@@ ji University in 1987 and served as its dean .
he is a pioneer in the study of wind resistance of bridge and a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering .
I &apos;m Professor Xiang &apos;s first postgraduate student and later I continued my PhD studies with him .
I am mainly engaged in the teaching and research on wind resistance of bridges , and I serve as dean of the Bridge Engineering Department of Tong@@ ji University for over 10 years .
so I &apos;m proud to claim today that I &apos;m the very successor of Professor Li &apos;s bridge engineering studies and Professor Xiang &apos;s wind engineering studies of bridges .
actually over 60 teachers at my Department can be called successor of Professor Li &apos;s bridge engineering studies and Professor Xiang &apos;s wind engineering studies of bridges .
when we talk about the contribution made by Tong@@ ji University towards bridge engineering in China , the first thing that comes to my mind is the university called for and implement the independent construction of bridges .
I believe that the Shang@@ ha@@ in@@ ese here will know that one of the things that all Shang@@ ha@@ in@@ ese are most proud of is the first bridge built cross Huang@@ pu River , the Nan@@ pu Bridge .
in the 1980s , there was once an intense debate abouts who should build the bridge .
on August 18 , 1987 , my mentor Professor Xiang wrote a letter to Jiang Z@@ em@@ in , then then Mayor of Shanghai , calling for independent construction of the Nan@@ pu Bridge .
in his letter , Professor Xiang wrote , &quot; China &apos;s bridge engineering is fully capable of designing and building a large @-@ span bridge like the Huang@@ pu River Bridge in scale and technique requirements . Chinese engineering needs a chance to practice and to improve its ability . &quot;
this is the first cry , calling for independent construction of bridges in China , by a bridge engineering expert to Shanghai and to the entire China .
one month later , Jiang Z@@ em@@ in hand@@ wrote his instructions on Professor Xiang &apos;s letter , saying that &quot; I think we should make a decision now , the bridge should be built by Chinese ; or we can have a Chinese American , such as Lin Tong@@ yan , to consult . &quot;
when the decision of independent construction was made , 75 @-@ year @-@ old Li Gu@@ o@@ hao was appointed as the leader of the expert panel , but he didn &apos;t invite any foreigners to consult .
in 1989 , the construction of Shanghai Nan@@ pu Bridge began .
except for steel beams and steel wire strands were imported materials , all other construction materials were domestically made , fully reflecting the high degree of independent construction .
on November 19 , 1991 , Shanghai Nan@@ pu Bridge was successfully completed and opened to traffic , greatly enhancing the confidence of China &apos;s bridge building sector to build large @-@ span bridges on its own .
and at the end of that year , Professor Li , a native of M@@ ei@@ xian in Guangdong , learned that Hum@@ en in Guangdong planned to have the Hum@@ en Bridge built and invested by an English company .
professor Li was from Guangdong and he had a great affection for his hometown .
he immediately wrote a letter to Ye Xu@@ an@@ ping , then Governor of Guangdong , saying that &quot; Hum@@ en , where Lin Z@@ ex@@ u carried out the destruction of opium , is a place that reminds people of our national humiliation , and it is very hard for us to accept mentally a British company . also , the independ@@ ant construction of th Nan@@ pu Bridge in Shanghai proved to be a great success . &quot;
after receiving the letter from Professor Li , Governor Ye Xu@@ an@@ ping held a meeting with him and immediately promised that Hum@@ en Bridge should be built entirely by Chinese .
in 1992 , the construction of the Hum@@ en Bridge began , five years later it was finished .
from then on , there is no doubts that all bridges in China are designed and built by the Chinese .
let &apos;s turn our eyes back to Shanghai , and see how many self @-@ built bridges there are .
in 1991 , we built Shanghai Nan@@ pu Bridge .
in 1993 , we built Shanghai Yang@@ pu Bridge , setting a world record of cable @-@ stayed bridge span .
in 1996 , we built X@@ up@@ u Bridge .
in 2003 , we built L@@ up@@ u Bridge .
in 2005 , we built Dong@@ hai Bridge .
in 2009 , we built Shanghai Yangtze River Bridge .
let &apos;s look at the major achievements of independent bridge building in the entire country .
in the 1990s , we successfully built Jiang@@ yin Yangtze River Bridge , Guangdong Hum@@ en Bridge , Guangdong Qu@@ es@@ hi Bridge , W@@ anx@@ ian Yangtze River Bridge .
in particular , Jiang@@ yin Yangtze River Bridge was China &apos;s first bridge with a span of over 1000 meters , making China the fifth country@@ in the world to build successfully a bridge of such a span .
in the first decade of the new century , we successfully built the Xi@@ hou@@ men Bridge , Run@@ yang Yangtze River Bridge , S@@ ut@@ ong Yangtze River Bridge and Chongqing Cha@@ oti@@ anmen Bridge .
while Xi@@ hou@@ men Bridge and S@@ ut@@ ong Yangtze River Bridge respectively set a new world record in the span of steel box girder suspension bridges and cable @-@ stayed bridges .
since 2010 , we built the Tai@@ zhou Yangtze River Bridge , Er@@ qi Yangtze River Bridge in Wuhan , Sic@@ huang He@@ ji@@ ang@@ yi Bridge and Hong Kong @-@ Zhuhai @-@ Macao Bridge among others .
we have also set a new world record in terms of double main span suspension bridge and cable @-@ stayed bridge span , as shown in Tai@@ zhou Bridge and Er@@ qi Yangtze River Bridge in Wuhan .
when we talk about the contribution made by Tong@@ ji University towards bridge engineering in China .
I would say the biggest contribution would be the appeal and actual implementation of independent construction of bridges in China .
independent construction has become the soul of bridge building in China , what are the ultimate goals of bridge building industry in the entire world ?
maybe you have found the answer to this question , as now innovation has become a cat@@ ch@@ word .
and of course it is very important for bridge building industry in the entire world to pursue innovation , but how ?
before answering this question , I will first give you an introduction of the composition of a bridge .
normally a bridge can be divided into three parts , and the main part is called the bridge structure , which is a structural channel that spans obstacles .
in order to sustain such a structural channel , we need to have some supports on both sides of the obstacle and below the channel structure , such a structure is called the sub@@ structure , which includes the pier and ab@@ ut@@ ment .
in addition , in order to facilitate the use of this channel structure , we also have some so @-@ called super@@ structure , which include rail@@ ings , lighting , traffic signs , marking and so on , all these complete a bridge .
in terms of support system of the bridge structure , we can divide the bridges into four types , namely the beam bridge , the arch bridge , the cable @-@ stayed bridge and the suspension bridge .
among them , the span ability of the beam bridge is the smallest , about 300 meters .
the span of the arch bridge is slightly larger , 500 meters .
the span of the cable @-@ stayed bridge is the much larger , one kilometer .
while the crossing capacity of the suspension bridge is the largest , which has now reached nearly two kilometers .
let &apos;s read two pieces of news on bridges .
on October 24 , 20@@ 18 , after 8 years of construction , the Hong Kong @-@ Zhuhai @-@ Macao Bridge opened to traffic and successfully with@@ stood the devastating Super Ty@@ pho@@ on M@@ ang@@ k@@ hut .
however , 4 days later we were shocked by another piece of news .
when a bus was crossing the Second Wan@@ zhou Bridge in Chongqing , it colli@@ ded with the protective fence and fell into the river .
all 12 passengers on the bus were killed .
these two pieces of news immediately made headline news in China and around the world .
let &apos;s watch this video clip .
this is the Wan@@ zhou Bridge in Chongqing , and this is the footage of the entire accident .
obviously , the accident was caused by human errors .
a passenger quarrel@@ ed with the bus driver , resulting in the driver &apos;s false operation and the collision with the f@@ ense .
what lesson can we learn from this accident ?
I think at least we can learn two important lessons .
first we enhance civic education , which requires the concerted efforts of the entire society .
and secondly we can help improve the safety level of bridges , for example , we can add a partition zone in the middle of bridges , and add anti @-@ collision rail@@ ings on both sides of bridges .
no matter what , we believe that this man @-@ caused accident could be avoided in the first place .
how about a natural disaster ?
can we find ways to avoid it ?
especially when a bridge is exposed to strong winds , such as typhoon or hur@@ ric@@ anes , how bridges with such a large span withstand these disasters ?
we now take a look at the tragic accident taking place at the T@@ ac@@ oma Nar@@ rows Bridge , Washington , USA , in the autumn of 1940 .
the bridge was attacked by an eight @-@ magnitude gale , the wind force was not very strong at all .
however , the T@@ ac@@ oma Bridge had a strong tremor and the amplitude of the vibration continued to increase , eventually leading to the collapse of the entire bridge super@@ structure .
the accident immediately shocked the entire world .
this accident marked the very beginning of wind @-@ resistance study of long @-@ span bridges , and a pre@@ lude for the ensuing wind engineering study .
why did this accident happen in the first place ?
we know that when the span of the bridge structure reaches a certain level , the natural wind will arouse the vibration of the bridge structure , which mainly manifests in three kinds .
vertical bending vibration , tor@@ sional vibration and lateral bending vibration .
the culprit behind the collapse of T@@ ac@@ oma Bridge was exactly one of these vibrations .
we call it flutter , of which the amplitude will continue to grow with the pro@@ long@@ ation of time .
of course , in addition to the flutter we have talked about , there are two other forms of wind @-@ induced vibrations , namely vortex vibration and bu@@ ffe@@ ting .
we will show you an example .
this is the familiar Shanghai L@@ up@@ u Bridge .
I would like to tell you that the span of Shanghai L@@ up@@ u Bridge is 550 meters .
breaking a world record that has been kept for 30 years in terms of arch bridge span .
the previous world @-@ record holder was the Bay@@ on@@ ne Bridge in the US , with a span of 5@@ 13 meters .
and the span of Shanghai L@@ up@@ u Bridge is 550 meters .
of course there are many innovations in this bridge , and indeed it has won many prestigious awards from home and abroad .
but I won &apos;t go in details here .
I want to talk about one particular innovation .
please take a look at the arch rib of L@@ up@@ u Bridge , which is similar to a rectangular section .
that is why we bridge builders calling it a not @-@ sharp knife , a very blunt structure , and of course it is compared to what we call a streamline body .
in order to avoid the vortex vibration caused by this blunt structure , we have thought of several solutions .
after having carried out numerical analysis , we find out that one solution has worked the best , that is to use full cover plates .
why full cover plates will work the best ?
let &apos;s look at these two video clips .
in the middle of the first video , we did not add any isol@@ ating plate .
you can see that there are two vor@@ tex@@ es there , and these two vor@@ tex@@ es end up producing a much stronger vortex , leading to the vibration of the two arch ribs .
we call it a vortex @-@ induced vibration .
what happen if we add a full cover plate ?
despite that there are still two vor@@ tex@@ es there , but these two vor@@ tex@@ es won &apos;t produce a much stronger vortex .
it is because that the vortex above rot@@ ates clockwise , and the vortex below rot@@ ates counter@@ clockwise , partially off@@ setting its vortex vibration .
based on our understanding of this mechanism and this innovative invention , we have made great improvements in bridge engineering technology .
and later this technology has been successfully applied to the Xing@@ guang Bridge in Guangzhou and Xi@@ jiang Bridge in Zha@@ o@@ qing .
that is my first example .
and the second example is the Zh@@ ou@@ shan Cross @-@ sea Bri@@ dges .
this project involves the construction of 5 bridges , and I want to talk about the Xi@@ hou@@ men Bridge that connects Jint@@ ang Island and C@@ ez@@ i Island .
this Bridge needs to cross deep water , but not for the use of navigation , and we need to have a very large span .
based on the experience of the world at that time , we can see that China &apos;s Run@@ yang Yangtze River Bridge has a span of 1,4@@ 90 meters , and the critical flutter wind speed is only 52 meters per second .
the Great Bel@@ t Bridge in Denmark has a span of 1,6@@ 24 meters , and its critical flutter wind speed is 65 meters per second .
but the span of our West Xi@@ hou@@ men Bridge is record @-@ breaking 1,6@@ 50 meters .
the bridge is located in the typhoon @-@ prone areas along the southeast coast of China , and therefore the bridge has a very high design wind speed , at 7@@ 8.@@ 4 meters per second , and the actual speed is 78 meters per second , the bridge has set a new world record in wind resistance of bridges .
in order to solve such a problem , we proposed to open a groove in the middle of the original overall box girder , so that the entire structure became a split box girder , so as to resist wind load more effectively .
we then carried out a large number of wind tunnel tests , and were certain that the groove , with the width of either 6 meters or 10.@@ 6 meters , will work effectively to resist wind load .
finally we selected a more economically viable split box girder with the central groove of 6 meters in width , and it worked well resisting the wind load .
four years later , this same technology was used on the Yi Sun @-@ sin Bridge in South Korea , and I know that a new cross @-@ sea bridge in Denmark will adopt this technology as well .
I have given you two examples of our latest wind @-@ resistance technological innovation .
and I bet you must want to ask me this question , &quot; Why don &apos;t you talk about the wind resistance design of Hong Kong @-@ Zhuhai @-@ Macao Bridge ? &quot;
from our point of view , Hong Kong @-@ Zhuhai @-@ Macao Bridge is formed by three independent cable @-@ stayed bridges .
the Qing@@ zhou Water@@ way Bridge has the longest span of 4@@ 20 meters , while the bridge for direct river @-@ sea shipping only has a span of 250 meters .
when compared , the spans for these two cable @-@ stayed bridges only account for one fourth and one seventh of that of Xi@@ hou@@ men Bridge .
therefore the technical difficulty for wind resistance is less challenging , and there isn &apos;t much technological innovations .
you see , we do not innovate to have engineering innovations , but to improve the structural saf@@ te@@ ty and financial efficiency .
with simple optimization designs , Hong Kong @-@ Zhuhai @-@ Macao Bridge can withstand typho@@ ons with the severity up to level @-@ 16 .
how about the severity of Super Ty@@ pho@@ on M@@ ang@@ k@@ hut ?
it was a level @-@ 14 typhoon , or nearly level 14 .
the route or the eye of the Ty@@ pho@@ on M@@ ang@@ k@@ hut was over 100 kilometers away from the axis of the Hong Kong @-@ Zhuhai @-@ Macao Bridge .
we now understand why Hong Kong @-@ Zhuhai @-@ Macao Bridge could easily withstand the Super Ty@@ pho@@ on M@@ ang@@ k@@ hut .
the bridge building industry in the entire world is pursuing technological innovation , and I have given you two fine examples of technological innovation that I have experienced myself .
then you might naturally wonder , as China has built a large number of bridges and made many technological innovations , how is the status of China in terms of bridge building in the entire world ?
we will take a look at these four slides .
the first slide shows the 10 suspension bridges with the largest span in the world , including 4 bridges in China .
the second slide is about cable @-@ stayed bridges , and six of the world &apos;s top 10 largest cable @-@ stayed bridges are in China .
the third slide is about the large @-@ span arch bridges , and seven of them are in China .
as for the remaining 3 bridges , two are in the US and the other one in Australia .
and the last slide is about the beam bridges .
5 of the 10 world &apos;s biggest beam bridges are in China .
so in average we can tell that half of the world &apos;s largest bridge building projects were realized by the Chinese .
so from these slides we can tell clearly that China has become an un@@ disputed world power in terms of bridge building .
however , is China also a world power in terms of bridge building technologies ?
before answering this question , we first take a look at 6 un@@ disputed nations with the strongest bridge building technologies .
the first country is the US that held all suspension @-@ bridge world records before 1980 .
the second country is France , the birthplace of the world &apos;s first pre @-@ stressed concrete structure and long @-@ span cable @-@ stayed bridge .
the third country is Germany , the founding country of modern cable @-@ stayed bridges and a country with a strong scientific and technological capabilities .
and the fourth country is Switzerland , a country that is good at building small and medium @-@ span bridges and has made many technological innovations on mountain bridges .
the fifth country is Japan , a country that has created and maintained the world record in span of both suspension bridges and cable @-@ stayed bridges .
and the last country is Denmark , a country that has made many technological innovations on cross @-@ sea engineering projects and is home to CO@@ W@@ I Denmark , a world famous engineering company .
these 6 nations are widely regarded as the great powers with the most outstanding bridge building cap@@ abil@@ ites .
after seeing a brief introduction of these 6 nations , we can roughly summarize 4 standards to evaluate a country &apos;s bridge building capabilities .
the first criterion is major engineering project , and China has many of these projects .
the second criterion is original technology .
China owns some original technologies , but not so many .
and the third criterion is expertise , which we still lack .
the fourth criterion is winning through competition .
it refers to winning open bid@@ dings for major design and construction projects around the world , and on this regard China is slowly catching up .
there are many major bridge engineering projects in China , but there is still room for further improvement .
and of course bridge building represents a country &apos;s image , demonstrating the scientific and technological ability and economic strength of a country .
that is why we should continue to explore , to innovate and to practice in bridge engineering .
Tong@@ ji University , as a power@@ house of bridge building , is now exploring the possibility of making a suspension bridge with a span over 5,000 meters .
as I have mentioned earlier , the largest span for a suspension bridge in the world is 2,000 meters .
how much courage , wisdom and confidence does China take to make a suspension bridge with a span of 5000 meters ?
we &apos;ve been working on this project since 2002 .
and as of now our research focus has shifted from the mon@@ olithic steel box girder to the split box girder .
when the split box girder has been developed , we are able to double the critical flutter wind speed .
at the same time we have also noticed one thing , that among all working conditions this positive three @-@ degree angle of attack is the least favorable .
under the existing positive three @-@ degree angle of attack , we can only build a bridge that is capable of with@@ standing a level @-@ 12 typhoon .
but in the future we hope that our bridges can withstand more severe typho@@ ons , such as level 14 and level 16 .
I believe that we can make it possible in the near future .
then you will certainly ask , &quot; Where will we build this bridge with such a long span ? &quot;
&quot; isn &apos;t 2,000 meters long enough ? &quot;
you can take a look here .
I can proudly say that , first of all , we can build such a bridge crossing over the Taiwan Strait , connecting Taiwan with Mainland of China .
and secondly we can build such a bridge at the Strait of Gibraltar , connecting European and African continents .
of course there should be engineering background and needs for such a project .
technically , a bridge provides passage over an obstacle .
in a broader sense , a bridge refers to any person or object that facilitates communication .
with the development of our society , people have given the bridges more meanings .
for example , we now say that a bridge is a link of friendly exchange among different people , institutions , regions or even different countries .
therefore , in order to realize the great rejuven@@ ation of the Chinese nation , let us work together to build more great bridges , as well as bridges of friendly exchanges in our daily life .
thank you !
hello , everyone .
I &apos;m Zhang Jing@@ wei , an anthropol@@ og@@ ist from Shanghai Museum .
so what is anthropology about ?
here let me give you a brief introduction .
each country , region or ethnic group across the world might have its own culture .
specifically speaking , in China , for example , agriculture predomin@@ ates , so Chinese culture is an agr@@ arian one .
Mongolia is dependent on nom@@ adic past@@ or@@ alism , so it has a nom@@ adic culture .
a culture can be further sub@@ divided , for example , in China , people in the north love salty food , while people in the south can &apos;t live without sweet food .
dumplings are popular in the north , while tang@@ yuan is favored in the south .
so why have I , an anthropol@@ og@@ ist , ended up on a stage that is connected with the future and hi @-@ tech progress , to give you this speech ?
I &apos;ll use one example to explain in detail how anthropology is linked with human culture and human future .
this picture displays a Mor@@ mon family from US .
this family , as termed by anthropol@@ o@@ gists , is still practising poly@@ gam@@ y .
two hundred years ago , this family model was actually very common all over the world .
family and marriage are obviously a very crucial part of human culture that is being studied by anthropol@@ o@@ gists .
in this picture , we can see a family from Nepal , a country to the south of the Himalay@@ as .
but it is not poly@@ gam@@ y anymore . rather , it is poly@@ and@@ ry here .
a woman can have more than one husband .
the two different marriage models actually reflect cultural differences that naturally occur across regions or countries .
but why do I mention those things ?
are they related with my topic today ?
let &apos;s not rush .
I have to mention those ancient family models , for the reason behind their evolution into today &apos;s mon@@ og@@ amy is technology .
technology has played a crucial role in up@@ ending human family models and human social structures .
here I want to talk about the Industrial Revolution which occurred two to three hundred years ago .
we all know that , during the Industrial Revolution , the human society went through tremendous changes .
specifically speaking , thanks to the technological innovation , production lines appeared in factories .
much as they are widely criticized today , the production lines over two hundred years ago indeed brought significant changes to the male @-@ dominated agr@@ arian families .
not only did they help men provide for their family , but they hired women laborers as well , which made women also a bread winner .
women then began to enjoy equal status with men and men &apos;s domination in the society was increasingly diminished .
that marked a huge change to the human social structure .
almost two decades into the 21st century , we are now facing a most important technology in our times : artificial intelligence , or AI for short .
AI development might wi@@ eld multiple layers of influence on human beings .
there is a good chance that the relationship between man and technology , between man and machines , or between man and man , will be up@@ ended .
this picture is from the recently popular American TV drama &quot; West@@ world . &quot;
the story shows how AI during its interaction with human beings has far surpassed what we have imagined before about it .
it is overwhelmingly perme@@ ating our human world .
this is the first model of AI development .
the second model is displayed by the recently released movie &quot; Re@@ ady Player One , &quot; wherein AR technology is combined with AI .
men who get involved in the process , by changing their own behavior , are enabled to interact with machines and AI , which finally leads to a renewed relationship between people .
earlier this year I read a very interesting story .
it &apos;s about a programmer .
pres@@ sured by his family members who kept urging him to find a wife , he made himself an AI mate .
then he brought this &quot; girlfriend &quot; home .
it sounds like comic sarcas@@ m against programmers .
but it somehow suggests AI will have increasingly close ties with us , with the entire human race .
anthropol@@ o@@ gists used to focus on the relationships between people and between different racial groups , the ancient civilizations and the origin of mankind .
in future , we might probably add a brand @-@ new item to our working list : the links between man and AI .
those links , in turn , will significantly influence human behavior itself .
so I always joke that we might possibly become AI @-@ lo@@ gists in future .
an awkward @-@ sounding name it is indeed .
not long ago a research was conducted into changes and development of future occupations .
it predicted the top ten careers that would be replaced by AI and the top ten that would be safe .
luckily , for us anthropol@@ o@@ gists , our job , according to the list , was rather safe .
but actually I was also a little disappointed by that .
I can see from the frequent contact between AI and the discipline of anthropology itself that the latter has long been perme@@ ated and influenced by the former .
take one scene from our archaeological work for example .
some anthropol@@ o@@ gists may have to carry a small hoe or a shovel on their antique dig .
as they work , they might be thinking about how the evolutionary process of the ancient civilization could be re@@ enacted .
so could it be that AI has no or little chance to help us in that ?
that &apos;s not the case .
at real excavation sites , after some digging work , a scattering of pieces of pottery and china may be left among the ruins , awaiting archaeologists who would collect and restore them .
those sh@@ ards of pottery and china would finally end up piling up in the storage rooms of museums or of the excavation sites .
it would take a very long time to sort them all out .
usually we would hire some elderly women , who would clean those cultural ruins with a small brush , while trying to piece them together .
but it is quite possible that , over the course of up to twenty years , only a fracti@@ onal number of those pieces can be assembled and resumed .
there is a documentary named &quot; Masters in For@@ bidden City , &quot; which shows how the cultural ruins are repaired .
we can see from the footage that restoration of the cultural ruins is a truly arduous job .
but some smart rep@@ ai@@ rers are beginning to realize the value of AI .
they will use AI to build a digital model first .
then they &apos;ll just compare and match the ruins with the model , thus repairing and restoring the ruins to their former glory .
an obvious advantage of such a method is that the m@@ ounds of cultural ruins stoc@@ ked in museums or storage rooms could be restored as fast as possible .
we can see that AI is becoming a very promising assistant who can help us complete the jig@@ saw puzzles and improve our way of restoring cultural ruins .
but even that is only a small part of what AI can do for anthropol@@ o@@ gists .
you might wonder , what else can AI do for our archaeological study , for our exploration into and reconstruction of the ancient civilizations ?
I &apos;ll use another example to answer that question .
nowadays we &apos;ve got a technology called &quot; image recognition . &quot;
for example , we can use this technology to scan those yellow @-@ with @-@ age newspapers published in the 19@@ 20s and 1930s .
then the il@@ legi@@ ble words in the articles on them could be instantly recognized and accurately output 90 % of the time .
image recognition is currently being used in the restoration of not @-@ so @-@ far @-@ away historical documents .
some people are wondering if it can also be used in the exploration into more distant ancient civilizations ?
such attempts have actually been made .
this is a picture of the T@@ angu@@ t script , which became known only around 18@@ 20 and roused a great uproar when being excav@@ ated .
it had already become a dead language before the 19th century , for nobody could understand it .
but at the beginning of the 20th century , an interesting , great opportunity appeared .
during an excavation , somebody found in Northern Shaanxi a Han language @-@ T@@ angu@@ t language dictionary compiled by a local before the 15th century .
though that made it possible for us to study and understand the T@@ angu@@ t script , the specific process of studying proved quite frustrating ,
for , after all , it was a ti@@ ring job to compare and check word by word .
but if we could introduce AI into our study , we would then be able to scan the T@@ angu@@ t words and make them into different digital modules .
then we could compare and match those digital modules with our database .
in that way a major part of an ancient T@@ angu@@ t document might be resumed within a short time .
hence AI , especially the image recognition technology , has , within a very short period , provided us with a key to unlock the door to the world of ancient civilizations , which is traditionally thought to be long lost and drowned .
now we are very certain that AI is going to contribute a lot to our study of the ancient civilizations .
after talking about how AI will specifically benefit our study of ancient civilizations , now let &apos;s take a look at how it might possibly develop in future .
there might be some very interesting visions concerning what we call interpretation , or translation of human culture .
a very important sector of anthropol@@ o@@ gists &apos; work is to interpret the different cultures across the world .
to put it simply , if people from one country say &quot; yes &quot; by no@@ dding and &quot; no &quot; by shaking their head .
while in another country , things are completely reversed .
then , though peace might be maintained when they are left by themselves , there might be disastrous cultural shocks when their people meet .
the negative consequences could range from small problems like misunderstandings between people to even bigger ones like conflicts between countries .
I am not over @-@ exagger@@ ating the threat .
such things did occur in ancient Chinese history .
there is an example .
sometime back in the 18th century , the Qi@@ an@@ long Emperor of the Qing Dynasty was mul@@ ling over whether China should open its coastal ports to foreign countries .
there was a captain from Britain , named George Mac@@ art@@ ney , who would like to negotiate with the Chinese government on behalf of his country .
the negotiation was supposed to persuade the Chinese government to open its coastal ports .
but something occurred , which completely changed the course of history .
according to the Chinese etiquette at that time , all the visitors to the royal palace , whether you were the nobility or the ordinary people , must kne@@ el down before the emperor .
but such a practice was never heard of by the British people .
when the two sides met , serious cultural misunderstandings occurred .
the Qing government thought the British delegate was rude for they didn &apos;t kne@@ el down , thus concluded that Britain must be an un@@ civilized country , and finally refused all the terms of the port @-@ opening agreement proposed by the British delegate .
the rest of the story we have already known .
China finally had some contact with the West because of opi@@ ums wars .
not only in the past , such cultural clashes also exist in today &apos;s world when cross @-@ border communication and interaction take place in economy , trade and culture .
for example , China always keeps a low profile on the global stage .
when we score 10 points , we might only admit to 5 .
but its more asser@@ tive Western counterparts might just do otherwise , say , 10 points in their mouth might actually mean 5 .
so figures and rules could easily be misunderstood during their economic and trade communication , and the misunderstanding could even be further extended .
let &apos;s imagine then , is there a chance that AI could act as a medium to interpret what we say during our communication ?
or , can we just let AI replace our role in conducting the economic , trade and cultural exchanges ?
in that manner , with the help of AI as a medium , our misunderstandings with each other might be gradually resolved .
then in future , from interpersonal communication to the much @-@ larger @-@ scaled contact between countries , all the human exchanges will be better facilitated .
that is also our anthropol@@ ogical vision of how AI will benefit the human society in future .
thank you !
I &apos;m Di Gu@@ of@@ ang from Nanjing University , and I &apos;d like to share with you some research results in recent years .
let &apos;s start from a micro perspective , if we happen to encounter some kind of disaster in this theatre , can we survive ?
from a macro perspective , it &apos;s the tenth anniversary of the Wenchuan earthquake .
this disastrous earthquake took a heavy toll on this country .
nearly 80 thousand people were killed and about 17 thousand were missing .
that &apos;s approximately 100,000 people all told .
in terms of economic loss , there were RMB 8@@ 40 billion of direct loss and RMB 250 billion of indirect loss , which added up to 1,000 billion .
while back in 2008 , the total GDP value of Sichuan province was only RMB 120 billion .
so the loss caused by the earthquake during that several seconds was equivalent to the annual GDP value of Sichuan province .
in October 20@@ 18 , I went to the quake scene for research with my two students .
as Be@@ ichuan , the hardest @-@ hit area , was still sealed , so we went to another serious @-@ hit area , Han@@ wang .
and this picture was taken when we were there .
the picture on the left was the entrance of a neigh@@ ber@@ hood , there were senior citizens guarding it and they wouldn &apos;t let people in .
so we told them that we were there for disaster research and disaster planning and asked if we could go inside .
finally we were allowed to enter .
this was what it looked like inside .
the neighborhood was exactly the way it was since the earthquake on May 12 .
you may have seen People &apos;s Liberation Army and firefighters rescu@@ ing and saving people on TV .
however , that all happened in public buildings like schools and hospitals , not in residential areas .
as we went further , the smell grew more intense .
it &apos;s a mixture of disinfec@@ tant and something else .
what was that ?
probably dead animals and plants or human corpses .
that &apos;s why the senior inhabitants were guarding outside the neighborhood and wouldn &apos;t let people go inside .
as I came with two students , I was afraid that the smell would be hazardous so I asked them to step back .
this was one scene we saw inside the neighborhood , a broken utility pole .
we could tell that the design and construction of these poles were terrible .
this was in Du@@ ji@@ ang@@ yan and it was a residential area , all the habit@@ ants were outside their house , living on the river@@ bank .
what does that mean ?
the earthquake had been over for 5 months , yet people still were seeking shelters by the river .
what does that tell us ?
it tells that during our urban planning , we didn &apos;t plan for emergency shelters in our disaster prevention and disaster risk reduction .
however , we are a country prone to multiple disasters such as earthquakes , floods , droughts , typho@@ ons etc. in nearly every province .
particularly earthquakes , for 7 % of our land provides for 22 % of the world population while it suffers from 33 % of the world &apos;s strong shocks .
according to China Earthquake Administration , 8@@ 000 earthquakes took place in China since 1900 , of which 800 were strong shocks above magnitude 6 .
5@@ 50,000 people were killed in the earthquakes , which was 53 % of the total casualties in the world .
if we calculate the casualties and losses from 2010 , there have been about 2,000 people died from natural disasters nationwide .
the economic loss amounted to around 400 billion RMB , which is 0.5 % of the GDP of our country .
if there were di@@ asters like fires , then the damage would be more important .
for example , the earthquake in Y@@ ushu in 2010 and 2011 caused in total 6@@ 000 casu@@ al@@ ites .
after the earthquake , I led the post @-@ disaster reconstruction and planning team of our un@@ versity on a trip to Y@@ ushu to provide support .
globally , both the frequency of disasters and economic losses caused by disasters have increased .
admittedly , we have made achievements in disaster prevention and mitigation since the Wenchuan earthquake .
firstly , the Party and the Central Government attach great importance to disaster prevention and mitigation .
secondly , a network of China &apos;s emergency management institutions has gradually come into shape , and the Ministry of Emergency Management was established in March this year .
thirdly , national legisl@@ ations and regulations on disaster prevention and mitigation have been basically completed .
fourthly , the city @-@ level emergency management systems have taken shape nationwide .
these systems embody the establishment of a preliminary emergency management system that shed light on institutions , mechanisms , laws and contingency plans .
lastly , we have paid much attention to the reinforcement of community safety and the development of safety culture , in particular the implementation of disaster @-@ prevention drills and the reinforcement of community safety .
also , an Internet @-@ based management system is being put in place step by step .
of course , there are still gaps for us to fill for the best practice in disaster prevention and mitigation .
the gaps are mainly in the following aspects .
firstly , compared with developed countries , especially those like Japan and the US .
we &apos;re focusing merely on disaster prevention or mitigation , which is the primitive stage of the disaster prevention or mitigation model .
the developed countries , however , have shifted their focus to the establishment of resilient cities .
secondly , China only underlines the development of tangible structures , such as the contr@@ uc@@ tion of flood dams and the improvement of seismic resistance of building .
however , foreign countries have started to combine both tangible and intangible measures .
thirdly , we pay much attention to single source disaster prevention such as floods and earthquakes , rather than the multi @-@ disaster prevention in the foreign lands .
fourthly , we rely mainly on our government to lead the efforts in disaster prevention and mitigation .
by contrast , developed countries tend to combine the efforts of government , society and individuals .
the gaps or problems demonstrate themselves in the discrepancy between our inadequate infrastructure and the the ever @-@ growing demands of the people .
according to China &apos;s standard of disaster prevention and mitigation , an emergency shelter should provide a floor area of 2@@ m@@ 2 for each person .
but most cities failed to meet such standard .
meanwhile , we set low thresh@@ olds for building construction .
in some cities which do meet the standard , those shelters are mostly set up outdoors , such as in parks and on play@@ grounds .
countries like Japan and the US , however , have indoor emergency shelters .
in addition , our construction struggles to keep up with the growth of people &apos;s demand .
also , the disaster prevention and mitigation facilities in China are un@@ evenly distributed geographically .
this is especially true in small villages and towns in the rural area , and some cities in the central and western China .
there is a serious shortage of facilities in these places .
last but not least , the relatively backward management .
some places have sound emergency shelters built , with disaster prevention and mitigation constructions and facilities .
however , due to the lack of regular maintenance and management , the constructions and facilities didn &apos;t work at all in the time of disaster .
this is an issue .
our friends in Shanghai may argue that the city is pretty safe , and earthquakes or typho@@ ons would not impact us as they usually det@@ our and cause troubles for somewhere else .
it seems like that Shanghai has a supernatural ench@@ ant@@ ment that protects the city from disasters .
is that true ?
I &apos;m afraid not .
risks are ubiquitous at all time from the perspective of the risk science .
there are 4 categories and 36 sub @-@ categories of emergencies in China &apos;s Emergency Response Law .
the 4 categories are natural disasters , accidents , public health issues , and social security , which are further divided into 36 sub @-@ categories .
let &apos;s say a neighboring region , Zhejiang or Jiangsu , were hit by a disaster , which would probably impact Shanghai .
therefore , there would be about 72 kinds of impacts indoors and outdoors .
in the sub @-@ category of wars , there are many disasters and risks in each type of war .
therefore , I believe that Shanghai is subject to no less than 100 kinds of risks , big and small .
will these risks hinder the development of our cities ?
will they affect the strategic development of our cities , or the implementation of their development strategies ?
not really .
risks vary in their seriousness .
this means we have to focus on the imperative areas , and deal with major risks .
then what are these major risks for Shanghai ?
one is flood hazard , including in@@ und@@ ation , water @-@ logging and typho@@ ons .
according to the research results of Professor Wright of the University of Le@@ eds , Shanghai is believed to be the city most vulnerable to flood risks in the world .
how is that ?
because Shanghai sits at the est@@ uary of the Yellow River , and the global warming and rising sea levels would probably exert much serious impact on us .
secondly , Shanghai is subject to the risks of natural disasters , namely the ecological risks .
these risks are related to water , temperature , soil and the air etc . , which are essential to Shanghai &apos;s social and economic development .
thirdly , it is subject to cyber risks .
in the cyber society , complicated systems would cause risks .
we have cyber armies in place in many countries in the world .
why ?
for the purpose of preventing cyber @-@ attack or hacking .
so as a metropolis , Shanghai has to pay enough attention to it .
For@@ thly , the city is subject to risks in public health .
a hepatitis B epidemic broke out in Shanghai in 1988 .
SARS plagued China in 2003 .
public health risks are of great importance .
the last one is the earthquake risks .
Shanghai locates in a seismic zone of intensity 7 .
some may say we don &apos;t have to worry because the city is built on a solid foundation .
however , the history of Shanghai is of a few hundred years , and the whole nation over 4,000 years .
both periods are merely brief moments in the 4.6 billion years of the Earth .
earthquakes are formed when the earth energy is released in the cru@@ st@@ al movement , and we should take it very seriously .
how can we respond to these disaster risks ?
as I have mentioned earlier , some of the developed countries have shifted their focus from disaster prevention to mitigation , and then to the construction of resilient cities .
prior to the 1990s , disaster prevention focused on prevention at all costs .
from the 1990s to 2005 , the focus shifted to reducing as much loss as possible globally .
in post @-@ 2005 , our focus in disaster prevention and mitigation moved beyond pre @-@ disaster prevention and mid @-@ disaster mitigation onto the more important post @-@ disaster reconstruction .
therefore , the construction of resilient cities has been an internationally @-@ recognized common sense .
now China is actively responding to the call of the UN for planning and building resilient cities .
to this end , we should change our attitude towards disaster risks , and co @-@ exist with risks .
why ?
because firstly disasters and resources are two different sides of natural phenomena .
for example , salt is essential to us , but excessive intake of salt would cause disease or even death .
also , as the saying goes , &quot; unparalleled sc@@ ener@@ ies are always at the perilous peaks . &quot;
similarly , high returns come with high risks .
moreover , the precipitation matters .
heavy rainfall would cause flood .
while limited or no rainfall would cause drought .
secondly , disasters and resources are inter@@ changeable .
post @-@ disaster ruins and relics would turn to resources for dark tourism .
however , excessive utilization of resources would become disasters .
for example , the over@@ use of land would result in hardened soil and water @-@ soil loss , both of which are disasters .
thirdly , the resources used for disaster response are limited , thus we should focus on major disasters .
the goal of risk governance is to reduce the risk to an level acceptable to everyone , every region and every city .
it &apos;s not about zero @-@ risk .
so , how is our awareness of risks as Chinese ?
this is a comparison of risk awareness between Chinese , Japanese and South Korean .
we can see that Chinese are poorly aware of risks , much lower than the people in Japan and South Korea .
in short , China is a country prone to disasters , while Chinese have limited awareness of risks .
one more thing , the key to disaster prevention is to acknowledge our coexistence with risks .
then how should we as individuals respond to risks ?
and how to mitigate the impact of disasters ?
as we know that there are lots of risks and disasters .
take typho@@ ons in Shanghai as an example , what should we do ?
although there are various responses to each type of disaster summarized by scientists in disaster prevention and mitigation .
as for typho@@ ons , here is a pi@@ thy formula .
listen to weather forecasts for typho@@ ons , dams reinforced and water@@ ways dred@@ ged , gas and electrical maintained , temporary works fixed , ships in port and anch@@ ors dropped , stay at home and watch for signal .
everyone should bear these tips in mind .
in conclusion , I &apos;d like to leave you with some suggestions .
first , everyone should raise the consciousness in disaster prevention and mitigation .
we must know that disasters are full of uncertainties , and we should be prepared for any possible situations .
second , we should actively take part in the drills of disaster prevention and mitigation .
from these drills of disaster prevention and mitigation , we could learn skills and knowledge about disaster responses , as well as the current risks in the neighborhood .
third , we should make disaster preparations in the household .
for example , we shoul@@ de reinforce our houses and fix@@ ate our furniture firmly .
also , we should have other emergency relief materials ready , such as drinking water , emergency flash@@ lights , etc .
fourth , we should pay close attention to information like the nearby emergency exits .
like I said at the very beginning , if hit by a disaster right here , could we make our way out ?
the last point is that we should reasonably make use of insur@@ ances , such as buying suitable insurance products .
with that , we would get insurance compensation from insurance companies .
disaster risks are both challenges and opportunities .
I wish you all the best when you &apos;re in the face of disasters and risks .
thank you !
I &apos;m Xia@@ om@@ ao Wu , the founder of the G@@ rit@@ World .
you have just seen a lot of excellent works , including movies , games , and the animation .
have you ever thought that the media we have used hasn &apos;t changed much in the past few decades , no matter through cell phones , TV screens , machine screens , film screens or dome screens ?
I &apos;ve been thinking for years about whether this way of viewing can be revolution@@ ized or changed .
in order to find the answer to this question , I have founded the G@@ rit@@ World .
I have been engaged in the technical work of games all the time .
in the process of making games , I find , as the game is of high quality , can this kind of technology be used for film and television ?
therefore , in the past eight years , I led the team to introduce the game technology to the film and television industry . it can be said that we have greatly revolution@@ ized the way of making the animation and films .
it &apos;s a very long process .
technology can easily help update one industry , but it needs great efforts .
however , the shock and revolution it brings to the whole industry are also very impressive .
for example , we can shorten the lengths of pictures in the movies from weeks to days , hours , twenty to thirty minutes to even tens of mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds or one mill@@ is@@ ec@@ ond .
in the following , I will show you the video which has been made with this brand new technology .
you may not notice that it &apos;s rendered entirely at the speed of a frame in mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds or one or two seconds , or at the speed of a picture .
it &apos;s the works created by G@@ rit@@ World and Mas@@ aya Fuk@@ un@@ ishi .
the Director L@@ eping Shen of the G@@ rit@@ World is also here today .
he is the first director to adopt this global technology in China and even in the world .
okay , let &apos;s have a look .
I believe this year will witness a historic moment .
as you may not know , the works that you have seen are made by the brand new technology .
the production cycle of one episode , for example , is shortened from two months to one or two weeks .
I predict that this year will witness the innovation in this field .
we are working with major companies to promote this process , which , I believe , will in turn revolution@@ ize the Hollywood production process .
after game brings revolution to the film and television , what will happen next ?
here , it &apos;s time for us to discuss about our topic today : human @-@ machine interaction .
let &apos;s watch a video first .
a program can also be implemented without any phone .
as you can imagine , when there is no mobile phone , your pair of glasses is actually electronic one .
it &apos;s unconventional and portable .
then you can go everywhere with it .
all the screens can be cancelled through digital over@@ lay .
at the same time , you can also obtain good experience .
in fact , we can also further imagine .
after the mobile phone and the screen are replaced , can further progress be made ?
this is one of my ultimate predictions for human interaction based on data .
I think that we are probably surrounded by soft objects .
when I took the flight from Frankfurt , I was probably wrapped in a soft object , just like the girl .
she is surrounded by a soft object , like a ball , which provides feelings through many sensors on it .
it is the capsule that makes everyone feel like sitting together at the venue , in fact .
when you walk on , you &apos;re like this girl , who &apos;s been walking in the same place , in the capsule .
in this virtual world , she feels as if she walked forward , but she doesn &apos;t .
when this kind of capsule is created , I believe we may change our understanding of the whole world .
I think this is only the first concept or one of the possible solutions for human @-@ machine interaction .
the more horrible thing is that maybe the skin is fake .
you may be a bunch of organs and objects surrounded by blood , muscles , bones , and mer@@ idi@@ ans in a capsule .
this is more horrible .
possibly , it &apos;s your thought within the capsule .
only your thought is inside the capsule .
other things can be passed on to you by digi@@ tization and virtual feelings .
of course , it remains to be explored .
the aforementioned items are the scenarios that , I believe , are possible to come true in the future .
all of these technologies rely on the game engine to be achieved .
now , I &apos;ll showcase the game engine .
in making a game , we &apos;ll use the tool to make a game step by step .
this process involves many underlying technologies .
the tool will help you achieve them saving the trouble to repeat .
therefore , this step is drawing the terrain .
I believe our world is probably created in this manner .
firstly , we draw the terrain .
then , let &apos;s draw the lake and the vegetation next to it .
next , let &apos;s add some trees .
the objects inside can be modified , copied and p@@ asted at will .
the lights can be adjusted in real time at any time for 24 hours .
the color of the lights and others can also be adjusted .
if this tool can be operated easily on your mobile phone , your friends , your spouse and you can create the scene and easily experience everything in the scen@@ e.@@ Have you ever thought about that ?
how amazing it is , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s not enough to have a game engine .
like the scenes I just mentioned , they can &apos;t run on the device because they &apos;re too memory @-@ consuming .
in our process of transforming films , digits , cities and others , we will find any minor modification will lead to our work of maintenance for weeks and months .
also , we need to code .
we even evaluated all the game engines to prove whether the existing open source engine can be used for production to meet the needs of the next generation for human @-@ machine interaction .
our conclusion is that it is better to rewrite .
as a lot of things have been fully solidi@@ fied , we are unable to implant new algorithms in the existing ones .
there are more than 20 people in our company in Germany for developing the next generation of digital engine .
by the end of this year , there &apos;ll be a test version .
we hope that this engine will be put into production and used next year .
we call it GR@@ IT@@ GEN@@ E , because we just want it to be available to everyone so that it can change the way of human digital interaction as a whole just like the gene transformation .
the aforementioned are display technologies , i.e. , you create the virtual things .
if we want to revolution@@ ize the human @-@ machine interaction , we still need a very core technology , &quot; digital reconstruction technology . &quot;
for example , if I want to turn the entire auditorium into a vast ocean , then in addition to this display technology , I have to check the height of the ground and the size of the entire theater .
therefore , machine vision technology is needed .
I need to take some photos .
in a better situation , with the scanning of the mobile phone , all the dimensions about the size can be obtained .
or , a little movement of my device during my speech can help detect the size .
if I pull an ocean in , the ocean emerges in front of me .
therefore , digital reconstruction technology is the second core technology .
let &apos;s take a look at a demo of the digital city that we have created with our latest mass production technology .
this is a hundred @-@ square @-@ kilometer area in Dong@@ guan .
we have reconstructed a digital chassis with a one @-@ to @-@ one ratio .
as far as I know , this is the first project to carry out the entire restoration on this scale .
lakes , roads , vehicles , and entire houses are all converted to digital models with a one @-@ to @-@ one ratio .
you can arbitrarily modify models , play the &quot; Need for Speed &quot; game inside , or have dinner with your family in a building .
this project was feasible before , but it didn &apos;t reach mass production .
as the cost is acceptable , we meet the challenge and launch the project .
this is a demonstration of the central city of Hangzhou , which is also restored based on one @-@ to @-@ one ratio .
this is Hu@@ anch@@ eng East Road .
all the vehicles on the road are digital ones installed with AI functions , so they will automatically stop when they detect the vehicles in front .
then you can implant any information into it , like microscopic @-@ displayed information , advertising , e @-@ commerce and e @-@ government information .
traffic lights can also be automatically optimized and scheduled .
this is a project we have worked with Ali@@ baba ET City Brain .
in this mass production process , we have encountered many technical problems , which we have solved directly .
this is a good example .
after you take a few photos , we have tools that help build the model of the photos directly .
in the future , this tool will deliver it to our mobile phones .
you can see that the time has been shortened from days or one day to a few minutes .
this is a picture from Microsoft Research Institute in Asia .
by using the technology , 3D model can be established based on the 2@@ D model of the picture .
for instance , if there is a photo of a shoe , the e @-@ commerce company can make it directly by the technology .
then , the color can be changed and rotation can be also achieved .
as everyone can see , every single breakthrough in technology is very impressive .
however , it &apos;s hard to integrate these technologies to reach this goal .
therefore , we hope that our company can make its due contribution to the wave of human @-@ machine interaction .
in my opinion , our ultimate entertainment and life can hardly be separated from each other .
someone asked me , &quot; Why don &apos;t you make a game engine ? &quot;
I told him , &quot; Game and life are completely connected , so it &apos;s hard to distinguish game from life . &quot;
as we have just seen , the constant expansion of the scale and mass production of the digital earth , the promotion of the government and the scanning abilities of the smart devices , the integration and co @-@ existence of the real world and virtual digital world emerge .
the digital world can be super@@ imposed onto the real world .
you can choose to live in the real world , or the virtual world .
then , it is very likely that we will have a digital identity and coexist with the AI .
the digital identity indicates the location in which you are and the world which you live in .
finally , I would like to share with you what is the digital world and the human @-@ machine interaction I expect .
let &apos;s imagine , everyone .
for example , my daughter , she is about 20 years old after more than ten years .
she is also here today .
she will go out from the school building and wait for an unmanned bus .
as it is too far away , this bus will take about ten minutes to arrive .
she first looks at the bus stop boards .
in fact , the bus stop boards are no longer needed , because they are all replaced by projection of glasses .
as she has to wait for ten minutes , she takes a look at the direction of the bus .
she will see a digital bus , and the bus is exactly like the actual one .
there are also people sitting inside .
of course , these people are digital , so they are similar to the real human , although they are not 100 % same to the real human .
therefore , when she looks across , she can see the expressions and behaviors of these people , and the arrival time and the guide@@ board number of the bus .
as it takes time for the bus to arrive , she can work with the classmates or have some entertainment .
then she starts to contact her classmates .
she doesn &apos;t need mobile phone , which is replaced by a device .
she talks to her classmates , &quot; Today , the teacher gives an assignment , so let &apos;s discuss about it . &quot;
then , she zo@@ oms in the image of the classmate .
she can clearly see that her classmate is in front of her .
of course , the image is not 100 % identical to the real human , because high similarity is too costly .
I think , firstly , this image will not be highly similar to the real one .
it will just provide some physical feelings .
just as before , she draws a screen .
then , she discusses about the plan on the screen .
after the discussion , the bus arrives .
she gets on the bus .
I think this experience is very likely to come into birth soon .
of course , it requires our efforts .
I will finally talk about my expectations .
I have two constant needs for the digital world .
firstly , I need to take business trips from Germany to Shanghai and then to Guangzhou to have international conferences with different teams .
I hope that there is a device that allows me to communicate with my teams just as if they sat next to me .
I can have the conferences , deal with P@@ PT , and observe my teammates &apos; expressions and tones .
this is my first hope .
secondly , my parents and my sister passed away many years ago .
I have never seen my grandfather .
I hope there is a device , which makes it easy for me to create my loved ones based on photos so that I can communicate with them .
I very much hope that our work , passions , capital and commercial projects can pro@@ pel these technologies .
in this way , the human @-@ machine interaction can truly be improved in a revolutionary manner .
that &apos;s the end of my speech today .
thank you !
good afternoon , everyone .
I am Zhang Wu@@ xi@@ ong from the Shanghai Institute of Micro@@ systems , Chinese Academy of Sciences .
I will talk about how information technology represented by the Internet of Things can help engineering safety .
I want to show it from several aspects .
all of us hate the jer@@ ry @-@ built project , but it is still inevitable at this stage .
we can recall that in 2007 , the Jiu@@ jiang Bridge collapsed in an instant because of the impact of the ship .
this was also a very important event at that time .
there are also many jer@@ ry @-@ built expressway .
we can look at the online assessment , which is the highway in Ti@@ anding , Gansu .
after opening to traffic in 2011 , although its construction cost was as high as 100 million yuan per kilometer .
the highway was cracked within a few days after its completion , and then it couldn &apos;t be used immediately and entered maintenance period .
there was also an incident in Shanghai .
at that time , there was a similar incident on the banks of the Lot@@ us River .
because of the extrusion of the soil , the building collapsed instantly .
of course , later , the price of this second @-@ hand house is not too low .
because people later discovered that the glass and structure of this building was still very good .
just its foundation was not done well , but it cannot be denied that there have been cheating on workmanship and materials .
in fact , from the perspective of Internet of Things .
it can start from the beginning of a building &apos;s construction , to its operation and maintenance to do the safety protection for it as a whole .
first let &apos;s see what is the Internet of Things .
the term &quot; Internet of Things &quot; was picked by Premier Wen Jiabao during his visit to the Wu@@ xi sub @-@ center of our laboratory in 2009 .
we provided him with the architecture map .
now we all know the word I@@ ot .
although the term Internet of Things may be unfamiliar to you , but we can have a look at it , there are many things in life that are already under the Internet of Things .
we can look at the M@@ ob@@ i@@ ke bicycles and of@@ o bicycles , which are good I@@ ot applications .
nowadays , the best application of the I@@ ot is smart driving or cars like this .
each car has hundreds of different sensors in this network to monitor the quality and operating status of the car .
the following is co @-@ pole that Shanghai is now implementing .
it integrates utility poles and street@@ lights into a system .
we can apply charging piles and W@@ IF@@ I to it , and then we can use it to do some of the environment monitoring .
this is also a good application of the Internet of Things .
we can review some of the early I@@ ot applications , I will start from the right .
this is the cyan@@ ob@@ ac@@ teria monitoring we did in Tai@@ hu Lake in 2009 , when the water quality in the Tai@@ hu Lake Basin was very bad .
the security system of the World Expo next was also a large single I@@ ot system at that time .
we can look at this on the left .
this is the Internet of Things system we have done for Pudong Airport .
it has been working normally since 2006 , for more than ten years .
and we have already caught more than a dozen people who are going to do some damage , but they haven &apos;t got the chance to .
the main reason is that we have this kind of Internet of Things system to carry out some early monitoring , to prevent and catch the destro@@ yers in advance .
back to today &apos;s topic , how do we use the Internet of Things to help building safety ?
let us first look at the construction safety of the building .
what can the Internet of Things do ?
there are several important things in the construction of buildings .
first , how can we ensure that qualified people are doing what they can do reasonably .
on the other hand , we need to ensure that materials , processes , and safeguards are up to standard .
we can look at the first construction site here , there are some I@@ ot systems in it , we can monitor the management staff in real time to see whether they are at work .
there is an electr@@ ician .
is he really an electr@@ ician who is operating some energi@@ zed equipment ?
does the one operating the tower crane has corresponding certificate ?
correspondingly there are some systems that can do root @-@ seeking , and some techniques that can be used for positioning .
then , whether the electricity is qualified for the building materials .
we can also start from the moment the materials arrive at the site , test the , and put them in the designated position after the test .
when someone goes to move these building materials , the system can maintain a trace of the entire process from its inbound to outbound .
just like we do food trac@@ e@@ ability .
the third is that we have to ensure that the construction process is up to standard .
we will have some means of I@@ ot , sensor means , including some of our video surveillance methods to detect whether it is up to standard .
in addition , we can look at whether the construction safety precautions are in place , whether our scaff@@ olding is safe and reliable .
and we will also use some sensors to monitor its quality .
so on this basis , we have made a whole set of solutions or systems based on the Internet of Things .
we can see that there are all kinds of such sensors underneath .
we can manage people and tower cranes , hooks and elev@@ ators .
we also manage the environment , including the exhaust and drainage inside , videos , as well as the vehicle &apos;s access , including its weighing and some automatic detection .
with these sensors , we control all the conditions of the whole construction site through information .
after that , we built a variety of application systems to conduct security monitoring and analysis .
here are some examples .
first of all , on the left , when we have some security incidents , I want to make sure that my staff , my equipment and my rescue measures are all in their positions .
in this case , there is also a system that can be used to monitor .
the safety of the tower crane is also a very important system .
we have some sensors on the tower crane to detect whether it is tilted , whether it is swinging , etc .
so for environmental construction and monitoring , the current government requirements are very strict .
we have to ensure that the water in the atmosphere is not polluted , so this is a very important part of the Internet of Things to solve construction safety .
the glass curtain wall is a big problem we are considering .
our country has been building large @-@ scale glass curtain walls since the 1980s .
the high @-@ rise buildings in our city are also very dense .
our glass curtain wall has reached 85 % of the world &apos;s total , a very high proportion .
however , the glass curtain wall also has a problem .
although the glass curtain wall has many advantages , it is more beautiful , and the construction is relatively simple .
however , the life of the glass is only 15 years .
if it is used normally , the structural adhesive of the glass is only about ten years .
so no matter Glass breakage or structural adhesive failure will have a great impact on it .
as for the field of glass curtain wall monitoring .
it is unfortunate that because the world &apos;s largest glass curtain wall use country is China , foreign research in this field is not so advanced .
therefore , at present , the most traditional detection may be that we take some of the detected devices there on our back and detect them one by one .
there are also some detection methods , that is , using this rubber hammer to knock and listen to the sound of the glass , so it is relatively primitive and backward .
at the same time we have some building materials whose life , mainly glass .
including structural glue and some structural parts inside , is relatively short , unlike our concrete structure .
the third one is that the external atmospheric factors are also relatively large .
the typhoon has a great influence on the bridge , and it is the same for the glass .
it hits constantly .
at the same time , the glass is cleaned every year .
when the outer wall is rubbed , the tower crane hung the platform down .
when the wind blows , it will sway and hit the glass , which brings a lot of safety problems .
in the past few years , the Shanghai Center also had a similar incident .
a piece of glass fell .
luckily it hit a car , not a person .
think of an egg that falls on dozens of floors could kill people , not to mention a glass .
therefore , we use the technology and means of the Internet of Things to do a glass curtain wall safety monitoring system , which is cooperated with some schools such as Jia@@ ot@@ ong University and Tong@@ ji .
we have front @-@ end sensors to detect vibration , stress , strain , including temperature and other parameters that affect glass safety .
there are also some narrow @-@ band I@@ ot transmission technologies that make it easy to collect state data from the front @-@ end glass .
after the data collection comes up , we can combine it with the big data and cloud computing tools in the platform .
including the more fashionable artificial intelligence .
we conducted a large amount of data collection and analysis .
and were able to provide early warning and establish a model in which the glass curtain wall would be broken .
in this way , we can know the extent of this risk .
the second question is whether we could get to the glass curtain wall in the thunderstorm day ?
in fact , according to our current safety standards , glass has certain safety , but with our system , I believe that in the future it will be much safer .
so going back to the third question is how we can solve the security of the Internet of Things in the process of running .
the picture on the left is the Jin@@ ma@@ o Building .
when we think of the safety of this building , we may first think of high @-@ rise buildings .
in fact , some places that are dangerous now are small and micro @-@ locations , including group renting houses .
there are so many people living in the family workshops , and the hidden dangers of water and electricity and fire protection are also very large .
just like our current theater , if there is a fire next to it , maybe everyone has already withdrawn , but we don &apos;t know if it &apos;s a fire next door .
it may have been very late when it burns over .
are there any means and measures that can solve the problems or give us some tips ?
there are .
so we thought a lot of ways in the process of running , and we have done a lot of I@@ ot systems for many different applications .
this is an independent smoke sensor , which is popular at present .
the traditional smoke sensor may be linked by the fire station , connecting with the sprink@@ ler facility .
any building must have this equipment if it is to be accepted .
but now there are some independent smoke sensor , which can integrate some technologies into it , such as N@@ B @-@ I@@ ot , L@@ ora and so on .
because of these narrow @-@ band transmission technologies , for example , it can have a life of more than ten years , so after we put this in the room , we can integrate some voice broadcast information on it .
if it is on fire next door , we may have this room informed at once .
with the support of the Shanghai Economic and Information Committee and the Science and Technology Commission .
we have distributed nearly 30,000 independent smoke sensors in Yang@@ pu and Hong@@ kou and the Oriental Pearl .
in each family in the future , if you are interested , you can also buy this kind of equipment and install it at home .
you can see whether your home has a fire or a hidden danger through the AP@@ P .
the safety of the elevator is also a big problem .
Shanghai is actually a place where elev@@ ators are very widely used .
we have 300,000 sets of elev@@ ators , and there may be thousands of elev@@ ators that have been in service for more than 15 years .
there are also 70,000 @-@ 8,@@ 00@@ 00 units in 10 to 15 years , so this is also a huge amount .
the actual service life of the elevator is generally only ten years according to requirements , so how to maintain it is also a big problem .
although we did not have so many accidents , the Internet of Things will certainly do a lot of work for the safety of elev@@ ators .
so now we have a lot of sensors in the elevator , for floors , level@@ ing , smoke sensor , main wire current and temperature , to judge whether the elevator is safe .
after doing this , we collect the elevator status data and can do a lot of artificial intelligence analysis remotely .
after that , we can rationally maintain the elevator .
now the normal maintenance of the elevator may be carried out with paper materials by people .
did he go there ?
how is the maintenance ?
no one knows .
but in the future , with this I@@ ot system , we can guarantee the safety of each elevator for real .
this is actually not my profession .
we have some fresh air in this building , including some systems for water supply and drainage .
with some technical means of the Internet of Things .
we can check the wind at the outlet of the fresh air through the sensor , check the air quality , temperature and humidity in the room to adjust them to the most suitable level .
then in the water supply and drainage , we can check whether the water volume , flow rate is appropriate , and then whether there is some pollution , etc ..
in this way , we can guarantee the safety of the whole building .
this is what our partner did on Guangzhou Tower .
like the tall building of this kind , after we put some sensors on it , we can also check the swing and vibration of this tall building to judge whether it is in a safe state .
this is what I think will be used in the high @-@ rise buildings like the Shanghai Center in the future .
then another piece , this piece is my own work for seven or eight years .
we did a security system for the middle line of the South @-@ to @-@ North Water Transfer Project .
the middle line is 14@@ 32 kilometers from the Dan@@ ji@@ ang@@ kou Reservoir at the junction of Hubei and Henan to Beijing and Tianjin , with 1 billion cubic meters of water per year .
but there were a lot of problems .
we can have a look at it , It will drill a tunnel every time it meets a mountain , and build a bridge ev@@ ey time it comes across a valley .
it was very complicated .
then there are indeed a lot of safety problems inside .
like the aqu@@ educ@@ t above , it is two kilometers long and full of water .
the pressure of thousands of tons of water on the whole base is also very large .
so we have a variety of sensors on it to monitor its displacement and seepage , and then build the engineering safety monitoring system accordingly .
at the same time , we combine some weather information with the outside , no matter it is the information of the Meteorological Bureau or the information of the local rainfall station .
at the same time , we also did monitoring the amount of water and water quality .
gather the information together to protect the entire project safety of the South @-@ to @-@ North Water Transfer Project .
we have also built a system to prevent human invasion .
if someone clim@@ bs the fence and enters the channel , I will know it and find him out in advance .
this will also improve the safety of the project .
here is an example .
just like this kind of human invasion is also a big hidden danger .
because we di@@ gged the project arti@@ fici@@ all@@ ys , it is very difficult for people who fall into this channel to get out .
the slope is made of cement , which is very difficult to climb up .
therefore , human security is also a very core issue in the South @-@ North Water Transfer Project .
I just talked about some technical means of various Internet of Things to solve or guarantee the safety of buildings .
whether it is a bridge or a building , whether it is a highway or project of South @-@ to @-@ North Water Transfer .
the new sensor of the future is indeed a very core technology , and maybe some implementation can be done in the future .
in our future intelligent buildings , it is necessary to inform@@ atize the entire process of building construction , including operation , renewal , and maintenance to the future .
on the one hand , it enhances the safety level of this building , on the other hand , it also provides some convenience for people &apos;s lives .
but our country still has a lot of defects in the new sensor .
we need a variety of new sensors on the one hand , but we can also see that especially in the high @-@ end smart sensors .
the United States , Japan and Germany are more advanced , accounting for about 70 % of the world , and our country is only about 10 % . .
from a production point of view , there are more than 20,000 sensors in our country , and there are only about 10,000 in our country .
so this is also a big shortcoming for us , but where are the benefits ?
it is the sensor industry in our country .
from the original counterfeiting , it has gradually begun to expand to the high end .
some chip factories in our country have begun to embark on the high @-@ end route .
here are some examples .
some of our high @-@ speed acceler@@ ometers , including gy@@ ro@@ scop@@ es , used to be widely used in the military industry and are now turning to civilians .
some of our pressure sensors are now also used in water meters and gas meters .
some of our explosion @-@ proof sensors , which we have already used when doing this security check at Pudong Airport .
some of our equipment with milli@@ meter waves , including some of the security equipment , are already in use at the airport .
so I believe that in the next three to five years , many of our high @-@ end sensors can achieve breakthroughs .
with these sensors , we can provide more powerful technologies and means for building safety , especially for future assembled buildings , to protect its safety .
thank you !
hello , everyone .
I &apos;m going to tell you some stories in a short period of time and let you understand the major changes now taking place in the design circle .
we will see the change of design value , and the significance of re@@ shaping designers and re@@ shaping design education in coping with the challenges in the future .
I once hung a poster in my office many years ago , and it was created by my teacher Paul R@@ and , who is an American designer .
there are three visual elements in this poster , namely Eye , Be@@ e and M .
when pronoun@@ cing these words in English , we have IBM .
this poster is simple and witty , adding a new humanistic element to IBM , a company that is used to be perceived with a serious corporate image .
Paul is the founder of contemporary American design , and his masterpiece - the logo of IBM in the 1960s - has become an icon of modern corporate image design .
back in the 1980s , I was a teaching assistance of Paul in 1989 .
he once told me many stories about IBM .
this IBM poster now reminds me of many stories that are happening or have happened to IBM .
Paul once told me that IBM valued highly of design .
its CEO Watson once wrote a letter to all IBM employees in 1966 .
he said , &quot; Good design is good business . good design contributes to company &apos;s sales and high morale . also , a better working environment can be created through that . dramatic design in printed material increases its message impact . &quot;
I &apos;ve also noticed the latest trend of IBM .
IBM had only 3@@ 75 designers in 2012 , but this figure rose to 1,@@ 100 in 2015 .
last year &apos;s figure reached 1,500 .
IBM is always in the process of change .
it was once a radio manufacturer , a computer seller , and now becomes a software company and a consulting firm .
many IBM employees were laid off in the past few years .
however , its designer @-@ to @-@ employee ratio is ever rising .
we have seen the power of IBM &apos;s latest AI system , a system named after its former CEO Watson .
it has a wide application in the fields of law and health care , enabling us to see the future trend of artificial intelligence .
we now understand that many of our jobs will be replaced by AI in the future , including designers &quot; jobs .
lu@@ ban , Ali@@ baba &apos;s artificial intelligence system , created over 4@@ 10 million posters for individual users in one day last year .
4@@ 10 million !
just imagine that if it were done manually , it would represent a huge workload and investment .
we have also seen the involvement of artificial intelligence in some customized designs .
in this website , the system will automatically generate several dozens of lo@@ gos and other designs , by simply requiring you to enter the name of the brand , the brand &apos;s style and your preference .
if designers &quot; work can be replaced by AI eventually , how can we cope with such a change ? you know , there are a large number of designers and people working in the design education sector .
let &apos;s take a look at the previous industrial rev@@ olutions .
it is true that many jobs were replaced by technological advancement in each industrial revolution .
however , each industrial revolution also created new opportunities for the design industry and further improved the value of design .
it is the same for the fourth industrial revolution .
here is a quote taken from Mr. Sch@@ w@@ abe , former Chairman of the World Economy Forum .
he said , &quot; A notable feature of the 4th Industrial Revolution is the coordination and integration between different disciplines and achievements . &quot;
to me , the design industry has this same feature , which is the self @-@ adjustment ability to cope with the new possibilities .
we have talked extensively about the future technologies today , and I believe that many of these technologies will become a reality in 20@@ 25 , forming one after another tipping points .
these technologies include dri@@ ver@@ less cars , 3D @-@ printed car , transplantation of 3D printed artificial liver , as well as taxation collection by applying block@@ chain technology .
these new technologies will create a disruptive change .
however , in the process of this disruptive change , designers will be given new opportunities and new possibilities .
we are in an era when the design industry has to face major changes .
and during this period of time , we have to re @-@ define design and the value of design .
as we have mentioned before , new technologies would replace some professions in each industrial revolution .
I personally experienced a desktop publishing revolution in the 1980s , or 1990s .
with the development of desktop publishing , previous professions , including typ@@ es@@ etting and manual color debugging , all disappeared .
but today &apos;s designers are more important than ever .
we can see some new phenomena that are happening now .
over the past few years , IT companies , consulting firms and other industries have started acquiring design companies .
Facebook and Google have started buying design companies since 2012 and 20@@ 13 , and it was relatively late for IBM , which only started doing so in 20@@ 16 .
we have also seen a new change happening in the past decade , that business schools are adding design thinking programs in their curriculum design .
design thinking has become a popular word now .
many middle schools in China are now offering design thinking courses , while in Singapore design thinking has become a compulsory course in high schools .
just a few days ago , the Prime Minister of Singapore talked about design thinking , saying that design thinking was an important factor for Singapore in upgrading from the third world to the first world .
design has played a significant role in the founding and development of Singapore .
in Silicon Valley , we can see that the number of designers increases but not decreases .
I was at the Silicon Valley in 1998 and in charge of Adobe &apos;s Design Department .
at that time there were only a dozen of designers , but now the number of interactive @-@ design designers has exceeded 100 .
let &apos;s look at those start @-@ ups .
among new technological enterprises in the Silicon Valley , the designer @-@ to @-@ engineer ratio is 1 : 4 .
however the ratio was 1 : 15 or 1 : 30 more than a decade ago .
a large number of designers end up working in companies rather than design firms .
they become technology drivers and tactical drivers , as well as drivers of the enterprise organization and corporate strategy .
they are designing the enterprise &apos;s service model , the interaction mode , and the enterprise &apos;s organizational mode .
in a way they are valuable corporate assets in implementing the enterprise &apos;s product strategy and development strategy .
design @-@ driven innovation and entrepreneurship are now popular cat@@ ch@@ words nowadays , as people have witnessed the increased value of design .
we &apos;ve familiar with some companies whose CEOs are designers .
these designer CEOs have inspired the enterprise &apos;s initiative to carry out design @-@ driven innovation activities .
Vol@@ vo launched a new energy car , Pol@@ est@@ ar , at the Beijing Auto Show last week , and CEO of Pol@@ est@@ ar is a famous car designer .
Chen Xing@@ bo , CEO of Hol@@ e@@ te@@ k , is an industrial designer .
by paying close attention to the needs of users and enhancing users &quot; experience , Chen and his research team succeeded in creating a disruptive product and saved a company eventually .
we are all familiar with MI , and there are two designers among its founders .
there are nearly 90 enterprises within MI &apos;s ecological chain , including 4 un@@ ic@@ orn enterprises each with value of assessment exceeding 1 billion USD .
H@@ ND MI has indeed become a role model of design @-@ driven innovation and design @-@ driven branding .
taking an example from Shanghai , founder of N@@ aked Hu@@ b is a designer too , and he created a complete design system for his company .
D@@ irk , a co @-@ founder of Z@@ an@@ ad@@ u , a high @-@ end tourism company , is also a designer .
we can also see that more and more V@@ Cs now pay greater attention to design @-@ driven innovation and emerging companies that help enterprises create value through design .
that is why it is very necessary to re @-@ examine the value of design and re @-@ examine design education .
more importantly we need to re@@ shape design education .
I don &apos;t have much time today .
I don &apos;t want to talk about the changes of design pattern , because that will involve a lot of time , and each design education pattern has its own characteristics .
when I took office as Dean of the newly founded Institute of Design of Central Academy of Fine Arts in 2003 .
I began telling people that we should have a different design education model , especially for the Central Academy of Fine Arts with a professional fine arts background .
most design colleges are based in a comprehensive university or a university of science and engineering , and therefore the design education models can vary .
but for design educators , we must first be well aware of the right talents that we want to cultivate , who are the talents that will be needed in the future .
in other words , they are designers who are needed in the future , and we need to cultivate these kinds of designers .
we can create different design education models based on the characteristics of different universities and our educational environment .
first of all , I want to share a quote by Leonardo da Vinc@@ i during the Renaissance , who expressed his opinion on how to cultivate artists a few hundred years ago .
I think Leonardo da Vinc@@ i &apos;s method still works today to cultivate the designers for the future , in other words , designers in the future should have these kinds of abilities .
designers must realize that everything connects to everything else .
it is a kind of ability to understand the relevance , the relevance of things .
Steve Jobs once said something similar , and I &apos;m sure we are all familiar with these words .
in a broad sense , the designers we need in the future , and the designers we need today , should be , first of all , be curious .
and this curiosity will allow him to always look at things and his surroundings from a fresh perspective .
he should also have empathy , and only with empathy will you create a good user experience .
you need to put yourself in others &quot; shoes .
designers should also have the ability to think cre@@ atively .
the designers we need should have the modern digital programming ability , a firm understanding of modern technology and other professional skill sets .
at the same time , they must be willing to shoulder responsibility and pass on cultural heritage to the next generation .
more importantly , they should have the lifelong learning ability .
design industry is always evolving , and only designers with the lifelong learning ability will be able to adapt to the ever changing environment .
of course , designers should have leadership and vision .
professor Qian Y@@ ING@@ Y@@ I , Dean of the School of Management of Tsinghua University , once expressed his expectations for his students in cultivating creative thinking .
to him , there was an equation , which was creative thinking equals to multiply knowledge by curiosity plus imagination .
as for designers , I think we should further require the ability of critical thinking and integration .
only with this kind of creative thinking ability will a designer become a competent one .
back to the poster designed by Paul .
our time is different from that when Paul designed this poster .
however , in the era of AI and the 4th industrial revolution , we are still in need of fine designers to design poster like this one , and we can &apos;t expect a machine to produce this kind of poster .
designers are people who are able to connect cultural arts with technology in the future , and designers are people who are able to inject vitality to a company .
in the past , designers beauti@@ fied products , while in the future , designers become a driving force for enterprise innovation .
therefore it is meaningful for us to look at the poster once again , read the letter written by former IBM CEO Watson in 1966 , and think hard of Watson &apos;s words , &quot; Good design is good business . &quot;
I think today we should say that a good design is also a good culture , and a good design should have the innovation @-@ driven power .
a good design not only creates culture , but also facilitates the development of technologies and the design itself .
but eventually everything we do is for people .
I have been kept saying this whenever I make a speech at Central Academy of Fine Arts these years .
the ultimate purpose of design is to serve people .
and that is also the ultimate goal of design education .
thank you .
hello everyone !
I am Zhong We@@ id@@ ong from Marine Design and Research Institute of China ( Mar@@ ic ) .
I am a ship designer .
many of you might know about a Chinese dred@@ ger named M@@ V Tian K@@ un Hao .
this ship is a modern dred@@ ger that we independently developed in accordance with international standards .
well , my job is very closely related to dred@@ ging equipment .
first of all , I &apos;d like to introduce what is dred@@ ging to you .
the term dred@@ ging sounds very strange to us normally .
it seems quite far away from us , but in fact , dred@@ ging is bound up with our daily lives .
dred@@ ging means excav@@ ating and clearing .
literally , it &apos;s a profession dealing with water and earth .
human beings used to live by water , so we have launched many projects related to water conservancy since ancient times .
the Chinese nation was born along with legends like Yu the Great t@@ ames the floods .
of course , we have some real great projects and facilities in history like the Beijing @-@ Hangzhou Grand Canal .
so here are some dred@@ ging projects that I would like to share with you today .
this is the Yang@@ shan Port in this picture .
Yang@@ shan Port is a piece of land reclaimed in between the Big and Little Yang@@ shan Islands in southeastern Shanghai .
it equals to the size of about 1,000 soccer fields .
that guarantees the high throughput of this port in Shanghai , and accompl@@ ishes an undertaking that transforms a small port to the world &apos;s biggest port .
this is a lake in the Ling@@ ang New City .
it looks like a beautiful drop of lake water falling into the sea , so that we call it D@@ ish@@ ui Lake ( Water@@ drop Lake ) .
it is an artificial lake measuring about the size of the Hangzhou West Lake .
the earth@@ work of a lake like this roughly equals to the amount of earth used to build 15 Shanghai Jin@@ ma@@ o Tow@@ ers .
there are many such dred@@ ging projects in foreign countries .
this is Dubai in the Middle East .
many of you may have traveled to this place , a man @-@ made island named Pal@@ m Island , which looks like a palm leaf lying in the sea .
it &apos;s very beautiful .
there are so many dred@@ ging projects around the world .
what are they designed for ?
as we know the Netherlands is a country whose territory is mostly below the sea level .
the country keeps battling against the sea water for the safety of its people .
after over 800 years of development , the dred@@ ging industry in the Netherlands has now become the strongest in the world .
of course , dred@@ ging is widely applied to boost the development of industrialization .
for example , Japan is a country with a very small size of lands .
many lands in Japan &apos;s coastal cities are shaped by dred@@ ging and sea reclamation .
the development of some cities and even countries relies on such sea reclamation projects .
the United States , and the cities like Hong Kong , Macao and Singapore , are all expanding their living spaces and urbanization by sea reclamation .
now let &apos;s take a look at what is the exact relationship between dred@@ ging industry and our daily lives .
the concept of dred@@ ging was originally put forward to ensure smooth navigation by excav@@ ating the underwater sediment .
in this picture , we can see that the Yangtze River is an important ship route in China .
as we know that the sediment concentration in the Yangtze River is very high , ranking fourth worldwide .
and nearly 60 million cubic meters of sediment is deposited at the bottom of the river per year .
that has brought about a lot of obstacles along the Yangtze River waterway , which will hinder the ships from heading upstream .
then our country has made a major decision in this regard .
it took us six years , until around May of this year , to complete a dred@@ ging project stretching downstream from Nanjing to the 12.@@ 5 @-@ meter @-@ deep water channel at the est@@ uary of Yangtze River .
thus guaranteeing smooth navigation in the waterway .
dred@@ ging project can ensure smooth navigation , but somewhat it is still far from us .
in fact , we apply dred@@ ging projects , in most cases , to dre@@ dge the water@@ ways leading to our ports to ensure energy supply .
this video showed that at the end of last year , the North China was in extreme short supply of gas .
then our country began to dre@@ dge the N@@ ang@@ ang Water@@ way in Tianjin at that time .
to open up this ship route and guarantee the natural gas carrier to dock at Tianjin Port , so as to ensure the gas supply in North China .
the dred@@ ger used in this mission was Tong Cheng Hao , China &apos;s very first jum@@ bo trailing suction hop@@ per dred@@ ger ( T@@ SH@@ D ) .
it can dre@@ dge an earth volume of 18@@ ,000 cubic meters .
the one @-@ month work of this dred@@ ger guaranteed the timely supply of gas for people in North China so that they could have a warm winter .
after figuring out the relationship between dred@@ ging and our daily lives , in fact , we may be more concerned about how do we deal with the earth we dre@@ dge ?
the earth is of great use .
the Hong Kong @-@ Zhuhai @-@ Macao Bridge is actually composed of two major parts : the bridge body and the tunnel .
the dred@@ ger has been used a lot in the construction of tunnels .
the construction of tunnels requires the dred@@ ger to dig a trench on the bridge at the bottom of the Pearl River following a precise positioning method .
thus ensuring the successful placement of the immersed tubes of the tunnel .
of course the sediment we dre@@ dge can be used in the process of connecting tunnels and bridge body , connecting tunnels and land , and the construction of several artificial islands .
I &apos;d like to take the east artificial island as an example to introduce the whole process of building an island to you .
the construction of an artificial island is not as complicated as you &apos;ve imagined .
after the dred@@ ger dre@@ dges a certain area on the sea .
we sink the steel pile @-@ alike cylinders into the water and connect them with each other , then we fill the cylinders with sediment .
we must connect all the cylinders with specific linking plates at the junction parts , and eventually form an island @-@ shaped area with water@@ tight structure .
then we pump and drain all the water out of the area .
next we can fill rocks or other kinds of hard bottom materials inside the area , during which we keep dr@@ aining water and adding sediment .
we keep filling in the area until it turns into an island @-@ like land , after which we embark on the surface level@@ ing works .
last we pour in concrete and build the land into a beautiful island in the end .
and the west artificial island is located at the Pearl River est@@ uary , the open waters .
there are more major sea reclamation projects in China .
for instance , the Yang@@ shan Port project in Shanghai .
this port is totally built in open waters .
Shanghai itself is an allu@@ vial port city which is formed by the flow of Yangtze River .
the city has less favorable natural conditions for port construction .
in order to facilitate the overall economic development , accelerate river @-@ ocean transportation and make Shanghai a pi@@ v@@ ot in East Asia .
after repeated discussions , China decided to build an artificial port in the area between the Big and Little Yang@@ shan Islands .
we can see that now the artificial port can approach the land thanks to the connection of the East Sea Bridge , then a whole through line is interconnected .
the port is located in a very isolated area at the est@@ uary , which helps it avoid sediment accumulation .
after some major discussions , we have formulated a principal for the construction of the Yang@@ shan Deep @-@ Water Port .
this includes the blockade of some river tribu@@ tar@@ ies , aiming to re@@ direct the river current .
we have figured out the movement of river flows and the hydro @-@ geological conditions in the tentative area with the help of satellite remote sensing technology and long @-@ term hydro@@ graphic observation technology .
then we planned to build a port island .
during our future construction projects on the island , the odds of sediment accumulation can be reduced to guarantee us a safe voyage here .
this is the whole process of building the port island .
following the introduction of the projects mentioned above , I &apos;d like to share with you briefly on how dred@@ gers work .
there are two major types of dred@@ gers .
the trailing suction hop@@ per dred@@ ger ( T@@ SH@@ D ) and the cutter @-@ suction dred@@ ger .
first let take a look at T@@ SH@@ D .
this video behind me shows a T@@ SH@@ D stretching its two drag arms to the seabed .
the maximum depth the arms can approach on this dred@@ ger , named Tong T@@ u Hao , is 90 meters .
the sediment can then be pumped up from the seabed to the hop@@ per on the dred@@ ger by the underwater suction pumps installed on the arms .
this dred@@ ger can dre@@ dge 20,000 cubic meters of sediment in one hour .
we can see from the video on the right that after the dred@@ ger sails to the designated area .
the sediment will be delivered by the hydraulic fill system to the construction sites of sea reclamation or artificial island .
let &apos;s take a closer look at the operation procedure of Tian K@@ un Hao , the dred@@ ger I mentioned at the very beginning of my speech .
it first inser@@ ts its two steel piles under the water , and uses the steel piles to firmly anchor the ship in the working areas .
then the three @-@ cable positioning system and the cutter head on the ship &apos;s bow will work together to carry out accurate underwater digging .
the underwater digging is of very high efficiency .
a dred@@ ger like this can dig 6,000 cubic meters of sediment every hour .
if we fill all the sediment into a one @-@ meter @-@ deep pit , the pit &apos;s surface area is equal to that of a soccer field .
after transporting it through a long @-@ distance pipeline , the sediment can be sent to the islands we need to fill .
here I &apos;ll make a brief summary of what do we need for sea reclamation .
as we talked about and saw from the video before , the Tong T@@ u Hao can dig as deep as 90 meters underwater .
so the depth of sea water is a very important factor for sea reclamation .
only when the sea water is deep enough can we collect sand and other raw materials for sea reclamation projects in farther waters .
this is the basic condition for the construction of an island .
of course , how well the island construction project progresses and how profoundly it can affect depend on how large the size of the dred@@ ger fleet we apply to sea reclamation .
and undoubtedly , during the dred@@ ging projects , we always keep an eye on its impact on the environment , and try our best to lower the impact to the minimum level .
after the introduction of these dred@@ ging projects , I &apos;d like to present you a brief demonstration of China &apos;s the history of development of dred@@ ging industry .
China &apos;s dred@@ ging industry dates back to early years before the foundation of the People &apos;s Republic of China and even years of the late Qing Dynasty .
but I won &apos;t elaborate today .
instead , I &apos;ll give you a brief introduction of the development of dred@@ ging industry in China over the past decade or so , starting from 2000 .
China &apos;s large @-@ size dred@@ ging equipment , like dred@@ gers , was mostly imported from Europe before the year of 2000 .
the main reason of this was because China lacked core dred@@ ging equipment , and foreign countries imposed technological blockade as well .
so we could only import dred@@ ging equipment , which cost us a lot .
this is the picture of Xin Hai Long Hao , a dred@@ ger that China imported from the Netherlands in 2002 .
this dred@@ ger can carry over 10,000 cubic meters of sediment and is of very high work efficiency and performance .
it &apos;s a very advanced dred@@ ger even put among all modern dred@@ ging equipment .
this dred@@ ger is also the core equipment used in the construction of Yang@@ shan Port .
of course , China soon realized that the country needed large @-@ size dred@@ ging equipment to facilitate economic development .
under the support of national policies and different water@@ ways authorities .
many Chinese scientific research institutions had embarked on the design of different dred@@ gers and technologies of core equipment .
for the design of every piece of the specific dred@@ ging equipment I mentioned above , we built analog models , carried out ship model tests in real scenes .
and even developed many types of wear @-@ resistant materials , among other efforts to push forward the systematic development of dred@@ ging equipment .
we have made breakthroughs in many sectors after all these studies .
so after the year of 2000 , China has built many large @-@ size trailing suction hop@@ per dred@@ gers and cutter @-@ suction dred@@ gers , the production volume of which has become the world &apos;s largest .
the following pictures show some projects I &apos;ve participated in during my career over the past ten years .
the projects include the Tong T@@ u Hao , a domestically @-@ developed trailing suction hop@@ per dred@@ ger , also the largest of its kind in China that can be loaded with 20,000 cubic meters of sediment .
the projects also include some special dred@@ gers used in the est@@ uary of Yangtze River only .
these dred@@ gers are widely used for dred@@ ging and sea reclamation .
they play a crucial role in many projects .
despite of the massive development our country has achieved , we must realize that there is still a huge gap between China and leading countries in dred@@ ging industry .
although we have achieved the world @-@ class level in dred@@ ging , the development of the entire dred@@ ging technology still has a long way to go .
we should shift our focus from high @-@ speed growth to high @-@ quality development .
we must overcome challenges like insufficient technology reserves and innovation capabilities , we should carry on the R &amp; D work of core equipment and intensify their reliability .
all the fundamental researches and a lot of relative work we &apos;ve done can be used to support the practical technologies .
in addition , the R &amp; D work of wear @-@ resistant materials and intelligent technologies are all helpful to uplift China &apos;s international standing in dred@@ ging equipment industry .
dred@@ gers are just an epit@@ ome of ocean engineering .
the R &amp; D work of the ocean engineering has gone through the same path by starting from scratch , as that of dred@@ ging equipment we mentioned before .
take an example from the utilization of marine oil and gas resources , better known as fossil fuels .
at the early stage , we will send seismic vessels to explore the sea floor , detect the fossil fuels through drilling ri@@ gs like No. 9@@ 81 , and collect the fuels through production bases .
at the terminal stage , we produce oil and gas products on the Flo@@ ating Production Storage and Off@@ loading ( FP@@ SO ) unit .
which is like a factory at the sea , and then transport these products by shuttle tan@@ kers to the land to supply people &apos;s daily needs .
China has also gained remarkable achievements in clean energy development .
the growth of offshore wind power is a very good example .
after these years of catching @-@ up and development .
China has boasted a number of industries covering the installation , construction and electricity generation of offshore wind power plants as well as the maintenance of these facilities .
these industries will probably replace people &apos;s needs for fossil fuels in coastal areas in the future , and guarantee a cleaner , better life for human beings .
there are many forward @-@ looking projects fostered in the offshore engineering equipment that we are currently developing .
for example , some of you may have heard about China &apos;s exploitation of natural gas hydrates , or combus@@ tible ice .
these devices are all used for pilot exploitation of natural resources , such as deep @-@ sea mining and collection of natural gas hydrates .
we are developing specific equipment for the utilization of these resources .
I believe all these pictures will become reality in the near future .
the ocean is a huge treasure house .
human &apos;s understanding and exploitation towards the ocean is just a tip of an iceberg .
there are many science teams carrying forward cutting @-@ edge researches on new energies like wave energy and tidal energy .
they have figured out a number of ways to facilitate their studies , such as they have succeeded in generating power in the lab and transforming it into electricity for daily use .
at the end of my speech , I &apos;d like to mention that every one of us might have envisaged that whether humankind can live at sea or not in the future .
my team has made an assumption that we can put all clean energies in a space like this , we call it &quot; fantasy planet . &quot;
where we could probably live , work , reside and have some enter@@ tain@@ ments in the future .
in the face of the ocean , we do have a long journey to explore .
we can &apos;t stand still , not making any progress .
I hope we can move forward ceas@@ elessly , persistently and bravely !
thank you very much !
good afternoon everyone .
I am Zhou Le , a new media artist and also a technology creator .
the title of my speech today is &quot; Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada : how might AI Enh@@ ance Cre@@ ativity ? . &quot;
for me it is really a tough question .
but of course I didn &apos;t mean to simply throw this question at you .
let me remind you first that there is no fixed &quot; Yes &quot; or &quot; No &quot; to the question .
here , however , I want to use Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada , an AI @-@ based interactive artistic installation we &apos;ve recently completed and are ex@@ hibiting .
to explore together with you the possibilities hidden behind the question .
I &apos;ll begin my speech with a brief introduction to Shan@@ shui .
it originated in China and is an East @-@ Asian @-@ style form of fine arts that uses a brush and ink to paint .
in ancient times it was called &quot; liter@@ ati painting &quot; and was listed among the &quot; Four Arts &quot; required of the ancient Chinese liter@@ ati , the other three arts being Qin , Go and calligraphy .
in other words .
all the highly educated scholar gentlemen or liter@@ ati in ancient times must be able to use this typical East @-@ Asian @-@ style form of fine arts to express themselves .
a mere casual mention of Shan@@ shui will remind people , especially the East Asian people , of a genre called &quot; free@@ hand brush work , &quot; which pursues philosophical meanings through free@@ hand brush strokes .
another noteworthy thing about Shan@@ shui is its painting techniques .
you know there are various schools of Shan@@ shui painting .
so how can we distinguish them from one another ?
certainly the criteria can &apos;t be whether there is a pursuit of philosophical meanings , for such a pursuit is shared by all the schools of Shan@@ shui painting .
the only difference between them is their painting techniques .
I notice something very interesting about appreciating Shan@@ shui paintings - by the way .
I am not a good Shan@@ shui painter .
and I wonder how many of you are just like me .
what I see is that people always point at some Shan@@ shui paintings and remark whether they are Shan@@ shui @-@ like or not .
right ?
I guess all of us here can sometimes be a confident critic on Shan@@ shui paintings .
what does that mean ?
it means that , though not all of us are Shan@@ shui pain@@ ters .
the pursuit of a philosophical meaning through free@@ hand brush strokes is always in our blood .
what do we need , if we want to be professional Shan@@ shui pain@@ ters ?
perhaps only a half , or one , or three to five years of training on Shan@@ shui painting techniques .
but again it might be hard for some of us , for example , me , to spend three years in learning the painting techniques .
here is the thing .
what if you find something very difficult but you just want to have it done ?
you can ask AI for help .
here I &apos;ll play a short video for you , which displays Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada , the AI @-@ based interactive artistic installation trained by me .
let &apos;s see how it works .
then I &apos;ll tell you something more about this project and what I have done for it .
one afternoon I found a bug in a very successful AI model .
so what kind of bug was it ?
the model was supposed to recognize a wild horse in a picture and convert it into a zebr@@ a .
what &apos;s funny about it was that ？
it mist@@ ook me for the horse and shifted me into a zebr@@ a .
on the left side of the screen you may see a poster for a speech made by Dr. Kai @-@ Fu Lee that same day in our office building .
the two things - the bug and the speech , actually synchronized with each other in the same location .
and why do I place them together here ?
because the topic of Dr. Kai @-@ Fu &apos;s Lee &apos;s speech that day happened to be AI super power .
according to him , AI is a super power that will change the dynamics of the world , or even replace human beings .
that &apos;s actually not my concern .
what I care is whether AI can do something more humanitarian , be more fun , and join us in something meaningful .
as for the AI model I just mentioned .
it was actually a neural network , or more specifically speaking , Gener@@ ative advers@@ arial Network , which I personally name &quot; Intel@@ ligent Gener@@ ative Network . &quot;
it was developed by a group of very talented and intelligent scientists and AI researchers from a lab of U@@ C Berkeley , and was launched last July .
so what can it do ?
things like changing a painting by Mon@@ et into a nature image , a zebr@@ a into a wild horse , or a winter picture into a spring picture , or the style of an artist to that of another .
briefly speaking , it shifts styles .
the model was launched last July .
which was a right time , neither too early nor too late for me to choose it for my project .
so why did I choose it ?
because it was marked by a very interesting function .
shifting styles , as just mentioned , from style A to style B .
what does that mean then ?
it means the model can change hand @-@ sket@@ ched drawings into Shan@@ shui paintings .
like I just said , we can always leave the most complicated part of painting to AI .
it &apos;s OK if we , despite a spirit of pursuing a philosophical meaning through brush and ink .
know nothing about Shan@@ shui painting techniques , for we can just roughly sketch out a landscape stored in our mind .
and then AI will do all the work requiring painting techniques for us .
so that &apos;s how my &quot; Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada &quot; works , which I have trained into an interactive installation .
when participants scri@@ bble lines and sketch the landscape on the iP@@ ad , the AI will help to create a Chinese Shan@@ shui painting .
here I want to say something more about how I fulfilled the project .
first I collected 108 high @-@ definition Shan@@ shui paintings , all being master@@ pieces in history , from the website of the Taipei National Palace Museum .
I down@@ played painting techniques on purpose , and I didn &apos;t limit my choice to a certain style , or a certain painter .
the representative works I chose were all Shan@@ shui painting master@@ pieces throughout history .
then I applied several computer vision techniques to process the paintings .
simply put , all I did was crop the actual painting out of a frame .
for that was the part that really mat@@ tered .
but then a problem occurred .
you know Shan@@ shui paintings vary in aspect ratios , and the long sc@@ rolls can be either horizontal or vertical .
I don &apos;t have an intelligent enough model that would allow me to input any size of painting .
instead , the input size must be the same .
obviously there was nothing I could do about the size of the already @-@ existing master@@ pieces .
I had to find a way to uniform the size .
so I cro@@ pped each painting into multiple small squares of the same size .
that was a technical compromise for me .
but later I found that there was also a plus side : the original 108 paintings I collected changed into 12@@ 30 small paintings .
after all , more data are always a good thing for AI training .
so what did I do next ?
based on those Shan@@ shui paintings , I used some computer vision techniques to infer and generate some edge data for the hand @-@ sket@@ ched drawings .
then I trained the AI .
I wanted to train it in such way that it could help change hand @-@ sket@@ ched lines into a Shan@@ shui painting .
but all I had at the time was some un@@ readable code from the AI .
it can and will help me doesn &apos;t mean that it is ready anytime I ask .
so I built a client @-@ server based application .
a fron@@ tend user interface would run on an iP@@ ad , while the server of our university would run back@@ end .
the iP@@ ad was then connected to a large screen .
so finally Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada , our interactive artistic installation , could work .
hit the &quot; Rel@@ o@@ ad &quot; button on the user interface on the iP@@ ad , and you can begin to sketch .
then hit the &quot; d@@ ada &quot; button and ask Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada &apos;s help to change your hand @-@ sketch into a Shan@@ shui painting .
according to my observation , there are approximately six styles of Shan@@ shui painting that Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada can offer .
people frequently ask me two questions when I talk with them about d@@ ada .
the first question is .
&quot; what exactly has the AI learned in this project ? &quot;
briefly speaking .
there are two things in the AI .
a generator and a discrimin@@ ator .
the former keeps generating Shan@@ shui paintings .
the latter , however , is more like an evalu@@ ator whose job is to judge whether a painting is artificially generated or genuine .
so there seems to be an advers@@ arial relationship .
the generator is always trying to produce a Shan@@ shui painting that can be passed off as a genuine one .
while the discrimin@@ ator is forever improving its skills to discriminate a generated painting from a genuine one .
that is a kind of confrontation .
and growth , during a confrontation , might be the most natural thing that would happen .
so I just let the generator keep producing new Shan@@ shui paintings and the discrimin@@ ator do its evaluation work .
after more than 20 hours of learning .
the two continuously fought against and helped improve each other .
finally to the point that the generator was able to come up with Shan@@ shui paintings that were as life @-@ like or real as the genuine ones .
then I cast off the discrimin@@ ator and left only the generator as the generation core of my interactive artistic installation .
that is my answer to the first question and to what the AI can do for me .
the second most frequently asked question is .
you have mentioned that you want to change our hand @-@ sket@@ ched drawings to Shan + shui paintings .
but I find the edge data you used to train the AI didn &apos;t look at all like my sketch .
why was that ? &quot;
that I have to explain .
it was actually very hard for the AI to get the data it needed .
how could I get data from other people ?
certainly I had to pay people to draw for me .
right ?
but I didn &apos;t have the money .
then I got an idea .
when the first round of training - let &apos;s call it Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada Version 1 - was completed .
I brought it to Shanghai M@@ aker Car@@ ni@@ val .
after three days of preparation .
I invited all the carnival participants there to come to our demo and paint together with Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada .
about 7@@ 80 people attended the demo and that means 7@@ 80 pieces of real hand @-@ sket@@ ched data for me .
then I used those data to train my AI model again .
I list a sample of them here .
now I &apos;d like to demonstrate Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada Version 2 for you .
what you can see on the screen is a real @-@ time display of what happens on the user interface on my iP@@ ad .
for example , if I want to sketch out a landscape .
I &apos;ll first draw the mountains , and then the water , and OK .
the picture in my mind is almost there .
now what should I do ?
ask for Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada &apos;s help , right ?
since I haven &apos;t got three or five years available for technique learning , that &apos;s my only choice .
so here is the fruit of my cooperation with the AI @-@ based Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada .
now I &apos;ll sum up what specifically happened in the entire project .
first , I trained Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada with some Shan@@ shui painting master@@ pieces and the computer @-@ generated sket@@ ches .
when it was ready to assist people in drawing Shan@@ shui paintings .
I brought it to Shanghai M@@ aker Car@@ ni@@ val .
there it helped many lay@@ men to draw possibly their first ever ink wash landscape painting in their whole life .
after that ,
I used all the human sket@@ ches I collected to train the AI @-@ based Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada for the second time .
spurred by the input of those new data , it upgraded to a better version which was better at Shan@@ shui painting .
so here it is , the Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada Version 2 , which I have just displayed by using it to draw a Guilin landscape stored in my mind .
now I want to ask you a question .
who was learning from whom here in this project ?
was it d@@ ada that was learning from Shan@@ shui painting masters .
or we from d@@ ada Version 1 .
or d@@ ada Version 1 from our hand @-@ sket@@ ched data before upgrading to a Version 2 ?
or , was it we that were learning again from the Version 2 in our Shan@@ shui painting ?
and who was training whom ?
two months before I came here , I kept using Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada to paint , and tried to figure out how exactly it was helping me .
when we work with a partner , or a tool , to achieve an optimal performance .
we must first make efforts to get along .
in this process we are also learning to co @-@ create .
but who is training whom then ?
is it I who am training my partner or my tool ?
or is it my partner or my tool that is training me ?
or rather , who is helping whom ?
sometimes I feel that I was definitely helping Shan@@ shui @-@ d@@ ada .
for after all otherwise it could never come out by itself .
but most of the time I feel that it was d@@ ada that was helping me .
and I &apos;ll end my speech with the question I already posed in the beginning : will AI enhance creativity ?
that &apos;s all .
thank you !
hello everyone .
I &apos;m Yang Liu , and I &apos;m a researcher in film culture .
I feel very glad today to be given a chance to talk with you about modern Chinese movies and our middle @-@ class culture in the era of consumption .
let &apos;s begin with a question .
what does middle class mean ?
it &apos;s a word frequently seen and used in our daily life .
but what image is it connected with in your eyes ?
as you think about it , you might find the image is quite vague in the modern context .
for us , middle class sometimes can refer to those people with a very successful career always tou@@ ted by the media .
but most of the time , the word is just used as a general reference to the majority of the population who are the backbone of the society .
those people are called &quot; white @-@ collar workers , &quot; or more often , &quot; the middle stratum . &quot;
so how come the image of the middle class is so vague ?
that should be attributed to the fault zones and distortion of meaning caused when the word was introduced to China .
but then who should be responsible for that ?
we have to set eyes on the media in today &apos;s consumer society .
the audi@@ o@@ visual media in our time seem to share one single wish : to fashion , to imagine , or to forge a spectacle of consumption by using the middle class as a token .
and today I &apos;ll just focus on that part .
in 1968 , there was a very famous dramatist named Arthur Miller , who said in his repu@@ ted play The Price .
&quot; years ago a person , he was unhappy , didn &apos;t know what to do with himself @-@ he &apos;d go to church , start a revolution @-@ something . today you &apos;re unhappy ? can &apos;t figure it out ? what is the salvation ? go shopping . &quot;
that means , shopping has almost replaced the role of many production activities like religion and politics in bringing an integrated culture and intern@@ alized values to the society .
it is becoming a string of highly institutionalized activities today .
our society is shifting from a producer society to a consumer society .
some of us here might say , &quot; That word , consumer society , is an economic conception . &quot;
actually , rather , it &apos;s a cultural conception .
you may notice that today , all of us - our lifestyle , outlook on life , values and cognitive experiences - have been completely revolution@@ ized .
in the con@@ su@@ mer@@ ist West , something interesting happened : as the middle class surged , especially as For@@ dis@@ m , or today &apos;s &quot; production lines , &quot; arose in manufacturing in the early 20th century .
which hugely reduced labor cost and improved labor efficiency , the structure of production and consumption changed .
there were fewer and fewer manual laborers , for they began to make way for machines .
on the other hand , people in charge of managing , coordinating , distributing and providing technical services or support were increasing in number .
they were to become the so @-@ called middle class .
such a con@@ su@@ mer@@ ist social system naturally ushered in an instant middle @-@ class expansion .
but here is a problem .
classes used to be distinguished by wealth , but as the middle class pro@@ spe@@ red in the consumer society , we notice that strati@@ fication began to be defined by occupation .
so when some of my students , who after graduation chose to work as managers in TV or film or service businesses , complain to me , &quot; Dear Madam , I work like a dog , yet how little I am getting paid ! &quot;
&quot; am I a middle @-@ class ? &quot; they would ask .
and I would tell them , &quot; I &apos;m afraid you are , because after all you are not a manual labore@@ r or a direct producer . &quot;
the middle class is no longer a symbol of a certain amount of wealth or material possessions .
now whether a person belongs to the middle class more depends on the property of his job and career , his lifestyle , psychological identification and social status .
his work , first , must not be direct production , but rather , technical support , services and management , which involve a lot of coordinating and distributing work .
second , he must attach himself to a giant but steady institution .
third , his work must be an off@@ shoot of the post @-@ industrial era , or like what I said earlier , of the For@@ dis@@ m .
so who are all those middle @-@ class characteristics pointing to ?
shall we say the government clerks , the technicians , the company executives , and the teachers ?
they might all be called the &quot; middle class . &quot;
but those people are usually more distinguished by their life style and psychological identification .
they are different from the workers in the past who produced material things , and could see for real and feel proud of the fruit of their labor .
nor are they anything like the traditional nobility or big bourgeoisie .
the nobility have their in@@ born noble blood .
the big bourgeoisie feel quite reas@@ sured because their wealth makes them independent .
but what does a middle @-@ class man have ?
he could neither produce things nor depend on his wealth .
what can he do ?
that &apos;s where psychological stress and an anxiety for social recognition can easily come in .
so the middle class develop into a group most loyal to taste , image , style and beauty .
some of us here might have friends who we often describe as the &quot; petty bourgeoisie . &quot;
they tend to love those little weird things and sort of take pride in them , which is quite typical of a middle @-@ class person .
here is what they want to declare : I may not have a high economic status , but that doesn &apos;t matter .
I can at least , through my refined consumption , show how culturally superior I am to the ordinary people and those phil@@ ist@@ ine cash @-@ rich guys .
that &apos;s a sketch of the middle class we finally come to .
the middle class has become a very steady pillar of Western con@@ su@@ mer@@ ism , just like the circle around the middle of a rugby .
actually whether it is in the West or in China , there is a large surplus of material offerings for consumption .
in those commodities exists a wide @-@ scaled prop@@ ensity to make things symbolic .
what does that mean ?
let &apos;s take a look at these two ki@@ wis .
when you first see them , you may say , &quot; How cute ! &quot;
and they look feminine and healthy .
you feel as if they shall do as much good to your face as face masks .
that &apos;s not true though .
in fact the ad is just tou@@ ting the values and ideas behind the symbol .
when a commodity becomes surplus to requirements , to seek salvation , it must make itself a symbol of something else .
it is calling out to you , &quot; Come buy me ! consume me and you will get something more that &apos;s behind me . &quot;
the truth is , you will never get anything more .
but , silly as we are , we will nonetheless be influenced by the ads .
take me as an example , I am just hooked by this ad to this New Zealand brand of ki@@ wi every time I shop in a supermarket .
that suggests we are being brain@@ washed by this consumer society .
the middle class is being used as a pri@@ mal and primary driving force by the consumer society .
as to China , its con@@ su@@ mer@@ ism began to gain traction in big and medium @-@ sized cities from the middle of the 1990s , when it experienced socio @-@ economic transition and saw continuous global capital flow in .
con@@ su@@ mer@@ ism combined with media fan@@ fare swept through the economic system that featured large @-@ scale mass production .
all the urban residents thus came into close contact with the holiday consumption and the recreation consumption .
even people who lived in the mountains or border areas were not spared by the eye @-@ opening , omni@@ present TV , films or ads .
the most interesting of all , almost all the Chinese media then concentrated their attention on the taste and interest of the middle class .
inspiring images of jumping , robust middle @-@ class people pre@@ dominated in the ads .
ca@@ jol@@ ing us into believing that China had become a country where the middle class were rapidly expanding .
but that was not the case .
the truth is that .
as the serious national research conducted by soci@@ ologists like Lu Xu@@ ey@@ i and Li Chun@@ ling in their academic works between the 1990s and early 200@@ 0s revealed .
in China , the middle class actually accounted for a very small percentage of the entire population .
things haven &apos;t changed much .
surveys like CH@@ FS and those of Credit Suisse AG have shown that .
despite a huge expansion in recent years , Chinese middle class have remained at the top of the pyramid , rather than around the middle of the rugby .
there is one peculiar thing that &apos;s worth thinking about .
our understanding about the middle class actually fed on the media &apos;s report on the foreign middle class .
that &apos;s why we are still ha@@ zy about what the middle class should be like .
we have copied too much from other countries and neglected localization .
and worse still , domestic study of the middle @-@ class character is suffering from an anom@@ ie , or a terrible ro@@ ot@@ lessness .
now comes the second part of my speech today .
Chinese middle class also has its own peculi@@ arities .
we can see that Western middle class has experienced a long process of development , for it was marked by inter@@ gener@@ ational inheritance 。
which made it very slow to evolve .
yet its pace was stable and its character was clearly defined .
but things are different in China , where , so to speak , only the first @-@ or @-@ second @-@ generation middle class are gathered .
they , enter@@ tain@@ ingly , think like overnight million@@ aires and are crazy about f@@ laun@@ ting their wealth .
there is something more .
given the ongoing institutional transition , Chinese middle class , who are largely te@@ thered to the existing system of power .
are marked by a mixture of intense , ni@@ hil@@ istic dedication and cynical compromise .
what does that mean ?
for example , when we are facing a social moral crisis that &apos;s jeopardi@@ zing the public spirit of honesty .
the middle class , as the elite of the society , are often supposed to step out and speak up ?
but that they rarely do .
most probably they &apos;ll choose to remain aloof or even refuse to believe .
the word &quot; cynical &quot; means that , when a person is not satisfied with the society , rather than trying to fight it .
he will play a very passive role and endure it , or he will just bitterly exclude all things of the society .
many Chinese middle class are like that .
now think , those who have middle @-@ class parents , do you always hear them advise you like this , &quot; I@@ gn@@ ore whatever happens around you . just mind your own business &quot; ?
that &apos;s them .
that &apos;s what our traditional , conventional system makes them .
to sum up .
Chinese middle class are small in number and are weakly rooted . they mostly live like shadows of their foreign counterparts , and their growth is actually far below what the media say and they themselves imagine .
pushed to the foreground by their high socio @-@ economic status and the powerful media .
they come to symbolize the majority of people and seem to possess a potential discourse hegemony .
which is perfectly portrayed in modern Chinese commercial films .
as China becomes a consumer society , commercial films , especially those them@@ ed on urban daily life , keep spr@@ inging up .
which largely interpret the character of today &apos;s middle class .
when taste and style become the standard for defining what stratum a person is in .
movies , likewise , will present a large number of middle @-@ class symbols that will invite a desire for shopping .
hence those soaring skyscrapers everywhere , grand hotels , luxurious vill@@ as among the mountains , romantic parties , exotic scenery , fancy sports cars and even cruise ships .
we see food , wine , beautiful young girls and boys , people traveling or on vacation .
it &apos;s strange to find that movies are no longer movies in any traditional sense .
narrative completeness is giving way to the presentation of symbols .
stories themselves are making room for ads and tourism commercials .
moreover , in such a con@@ su@@ mer@@ ist context , the movies are asking people to re@@ shape their morality , soul and personality .
so what exactly are those movies advocating ?
a hed@@ onic kind of morality .
a nar@@ c@@ iss@@ istic personality .
actually a nar@@ c@@ iss@@ istic tendency is easily found inherent in the middle class .
for this is a class that most fears a slip back into the under@@ class while feeling hopeless about fighting their way to the upper class .
they have an innate kind of anxiety which urges them to strive for strong social recognition and a highly reassuring social status .
the middle @-@ class people will keep increasing their value until they think they are competent enough to get both internal and external identification .
too much self @-@ identification , however , leads to nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism sometimes .
then why is there the hed@@ onic morality ?
today &apos;s middle class , as we all know , are generally dependent on high @-@ end , modern corporations for a living and are bound by their regulations and discipline .
the more clearly @-@ defined , specific and binding those regulations are , the more eager they will become for a free soul and a spiritual remuneration .
yet they usually end up being mis@@ led into the so @-@ called Body Beauty Industry .
Jean B@@ aud@@ r@@ ill@@ ard , a French philosopher , once said , &quot; In this consumer society , the most beautiful product is our body . &quot;
such a consumer society is tr@@ icking you into building a perfect body all the time .
it urges you to inspect your body and weigh yourself up .
do I really look good ?
am I perfectly slim ?
should I buy something or use some product to improve ?
given their nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism and excessive demand for self @-@ approval , the middle class could come out as those movie @-@ go@@ ers who are best at identifying the young , slim and sexy bodies on the screen .
they take those bodies as &quot; orthodox &quot; middle @-@ class model images , which they compare themselves with and try to fit into .
those middle @-@ class model images presented in our movies , despite their visual pleas@@ ant@@ ness and ethical novelty , are not as im@@ mac@@ ulate as they look .
for example in 2010 there was a movie named &quot; A Story of L@@ ala &apos;s Promotion . &quot;
we all know that the film was adapted from a novel , yet regrettably , the adap@@ tion was too much .
the original story told about how a girl fought her way to success from among the grass @-@ roots 。
while the movie displayed a love triangle between the staff members in an office building .
the original story showed how hard a person could possibly work so as to make constant progress and finally build a successful career .
the movie , however , seemed to hold the absurd logic that a girl could reap love and success at once just by fool@@ ing around , being beautiful and romantic .
admittedly , there is worldwide prevalence of middle @-@ class he@@ don@@ ism , pragm@@ atism and , as we &apos;ve noticed , ni@@ hil@@ ism .
yet it &apos;s comforting to note that many similar Hollywood productions , such as the movie &quot; The Devil W@@ ears P@@ rad@@ a , &quot; and the TV series like &quot; Sex and the City &quot; &quot; Des@@ per@@ ate House@@ wives &quot; and &quot; Big Little L@@ ies . &quot;
despite their dep@@ iction of the sen@@ sual , luxurious middle @-@ class life , still spark@@ le in their frequent attempts to challenge , defy or mock the middle class .
why the movie &quot; A Story of L@@ ala &apos;s Promotion &quot; became such a big hit , as I see it , was actually due to the deficiency in our own culture .
another example is &quot; The Ex @-@ File : the Return of the Ex@@ es , &quot; an unexpected top box office ear@@ ner at the end of 20@@ 17 .
at first sight it looked like an urban romantic comedy , but under scrutiny it actually unfolded as a Te@@ en@@ age V@@ ul@@ gar Com@@ edy .
the hero was just selfish and childish in his relationships .
take the heroine .
dignity was everything for her , for which she could afford hiding her true feelings and even losing the man she loved .
a survey revealed that the movie &apos;s second largest audience were young people born after 2000 .
we had believed it was a good movie for the urban middle class , only that was not the truth .
what it presented to us was merely a group of middle @-@ class adults , gold @-@ collar or white @-@ collar , who tend to be anti @-@ intellectual and childish .
there was also a hot movie screened on May 1st this year named &quot; Us and The@@ m . &quot;
it shifted to black @-@ and @-@ white when the old @-@ time lovers re @-@ encountered each other years later , which was terribly sti@@ fling and depressing .
what was the logic behind it ?
a successful quasi @-@ middle @-@ class man , or more specifically , a successful quasi @-@ gold @-@ collar game designer , as he approached middle age , had got a social identity , a career , a wife and a son .
but regrettably , all those blessings had to be reduced to a sort of punishment for his letting his ex go and a loss in disguise .
to accent@@ uate how miserable his life was without his ex , the man &apos;s wife .
whose part was piti@@ fully small in the movie , was depicted as a par@@ ano@@ ia who kept checking the man &apos;s cellphone , and a wh@@ iny woman who was always complaining about how hard it was for their child to receive good education .
we can see that in those movies , the middle class seem to assume no responsibility for their family or the society .
but of course , since the film industry gets more diversified in recent years and the taste of the audience is mat@@ uring .
we might prefer those movies that present the middle class as they are in real life .
film producers also begin to review and doubt , l@@ ashing out at the moral deficiencies in our middle class .
for example earlier this year there was a movie named &quot; W@@ r@@ ath of Sil@@ ence . &quot;
the man we see in the foreground was Xu Wen@@ jie , a sanc@@ ti@@ mon@@ ious lawyer in the movie who allied with the evil .
using a brief metaphor , the movie pointed to the loss of morals among the middle class .
there was also a feminist movie this year named &quot; Lost , F@@ ound , &quot; star@@ ring Yao Chen , who played a lawyer named Li Jie .
this was a very manip@@ ulative , shrewd and capable woman who seemed to be a master of her own life .
however , when her child was lost , she was instantly stripped of her middle @-@ class halo .
what kind of woman was she in fact ?
she failed to balance between her career and family .
her husband threatened to divorce her , her mother @-@ in @-@ law treated her with hard violence .
and she couldn &apos;t even scrape together the 3@@ 00@@ ,@@ 000@@ RMB ransom .
and her job was , always like in an intense competition , drinking with people and in this humiliating way making them her clients .
in her we see that in today &apos;s China .
even a dominant @-@ looking woman who lives in the biggest city could still be so powerless and pathetic , that the middle @-@ class myth could be shattered in the blink of an eye .
there were also movies which displayed and criticized sham@@ eless , immoral middle @-@ class men , such as &quot; Ang@@ els W@@ ear White . &quot;
the man who owned the hotel , and the male doctors who inspected the wound , all being middle @-@ class men , had lost their moral principles and become a performer or protec@@ tor of violence .
those movies enable us to realize that there is something wrong with today &apos;s middle @-@ class culture .
especially when it is placed in an overwhelmingly con@@ su@@ mer@@ ist era and society .
but we must be wary of some realistic movies which seem to be criticizing and exploring problems in a profound manner but end up covering up for the bad things .
that &apos;s quite irresponsible .
but that &apos;s linked with the middle class &apos;s inherent tendency to guard the existing political system , for they are dependent on its stability for living .
social turmoil would be the last thing they want to see , for it would strike them the hardest .
so some middle @-@ class movies will just avoid confronting with the tar@@ n@@ ished social responsibility or morality in the end .
nor will they criticize or gr@@ ill at a deeper level .
now , as my speech is coming to an end , I want to ask you a question .
given the middle @-@ class myth created by the consumer society and urged by the world inside and outside the movies .
given the fact that the myth is in fact a spiritual crisis and a giant flaw of human nature manipulated by commercial symbols .
why do we , as well as today &apos;s movies , still go for those middle @-@ class images and myths ?
we have to admit that , those strings of symbols are inviting faster , more facilitated consumption , producing more desires and illusions in our mind .
and making it easier for us to get in such a fic@@ kle society a standard and method for self @-@ identification , a sense of security and a normal life style .
it is , I &apos;m afraid , also a myth that most Chinese people are desperately wanting .
that &apos;s all .
thank you !
hello everyone .
I am Dai Jian@@ min , and I &apos;m a lawyer .
currently I am a partner in one of the largest global law firm , I specialize in anti @-@ monopoly regulation and anti @-@ competitive practices .
today I will tell you something that happened between me and the law .
I suppose many would think the law is something irrelevant and of little pr@@ atical importance , which is in fact untrue .
I still remember that in 1998 when I was a straight @-@ A science student .
after the national college entrance examination , the mainstream , or hottest , majors then were finance and medicine .
but I , for no clear reason , finally chose law .
I also chose a particularly distant place to study - China University of Political Science and Law ( CU@@ P@@ L ) , in Beijing .
and I did all this without consulting my parents or my other elderly relatives beforehand .
why did I want to go to Beijing ?
I guess that should be attributed to a Japanese TV drama named &quot; Tokyo Love Story . &quot;
the scene of a snowy winter seemed so romantic for our generation .
the snow of 1998 came very early in Beijing - on November 21st , I remember that clearly .
so what &apos;s done is done .
my father was silent for a while when he learned that I would go to Beijing to study law .
then he said , &quot; Perhaps Hong Kong is a better place to be a lawyer . &quot; by the way , my parents were working in Hong Kong .
people around them , as I know , when hearing about me choosing law , were also surprised or puzzled .
they didn &apos;t know why .
they couldn &apos;t understand how a promising science student could diver@@ ge that far and study the law .
or rather , they saw no future in me studying law .
how did I feel about law then ?
I &apos;d say I didn &apos;t know .
I only knew that song , &quot; Tom@@ orrow Would Be Better . &quot;
but of course today you might prefer to say , &quot; Tom@@ orrow you will get more red packets . &quot;
so you can see that , back in 1998 , public awareness of the law was still weak .
the law was still a marginal and non @-@ mainstream thing for people .
after I became a law student in CU@@ P@@ L .
I found that the more I leaned about law , the more interesting it became to me .
in 2001 , I was a third @-@ year and I began to , like many of my peers in Beijing , prepare for study abroad .
so I attended New Oriental &apos;s English classes .
not wanting to hurry from the Chang@@ ping District to the Hai@@ dian District every week .
I moved to a doctoral students &apos; dormitory in Tsinghua University .
the first day I moved in , I saw my room@@ mates : three doctoral students studying civil engineering .
they asked me what my major was .
&quot; law , &quot; I answered , with tons of pride .
and they said , &quot; C@@ ool . let &apos;s talk about law . &quot;
I was at a loss .
actually I don &apos;t think there is anything we can talk about .
mind you , I know nothing about building houses . &quot;
they explained , &quot; Ac@@ tually we can talk .
all the three of us are preparing for the National Judicial Examination . &quot;
good choice !
I said , and then asked why they set their eyes on law in the first place .
&quot; is it for a good job ? &quot;
no , they replied , &quot; It &apos;s just that law is a very interesting thing to learn .
and given the extremely low pass rate of the National Judicial Examination - only 8 out of 100 .
we guess maybe a practicing certificate for lawyers might bring more value to us than our doctor degree does . &quot;
thus we began our little law seminar .
we talked about the Contract Law , the Labor Law and the T@@ ort Law , and they really knew a lot .
I asked them how they were preparing for the exam .
they told me that they actually only knew some legal theories and basics of law since sometimes things were a bit confusing for them .
&quot; so do you think you can pass the exam ? &quot; I asked .
of course we can , they said , &quot; because we are good at taking exams .
we are experts in the backward reasoning . &quot;
wow , that &apos;s cool .
we Chinese are always so good at taking exams .
right ?
so you can see what law was like in the eyes of the university students .
it kind of looked like an entertainment to them .
but we can &apos;t blame them .
after all , back then , they never had distr@@ actions like We@@ Chat or live streaming .
the National Judicial Examination was perhaps their only chance to have fun .
in this story , law brought entertainment , but certainly its functions can go far beyond that .
according to my personal experience , law can also give us wisdom .
the story happened around 2002 , when I was a senior who was about to graduate .
sand@@ storms were rav@@ aging through Beijing in march and ap@@ ri@@ l .
an Uncle Li , who was the father @-@ in @-@ law of one of my elder brother &apos;s colleague , came to Beijing to negotiate for a big project .
my brother asked me to assist him during the talk .
still a fresh hand without much practical experience .
I knew I couldn &apos;t do the job , though I did learn a lot of legal theories by heart .
but my brother insisted .
so I went there .
uncle Li , on seeing me , asked me to help him check the terms of the contract .
as I po@@ red over the contract , using what little legal knowledge I had .
I found a number of loop@@ holes inside it , for example , they even equ@@ aled the division with the affiliate .
the whole thing looked like a sc@@ am .
I told Uncle Li what I thought and listed out the loop@@ holes one by one for him ..
he was shocked .
I insisted that he should be more careful .
then he suggested another talk with the man in charge of the project .
the man agreed .
around seven or eight o &apos;clock that night , he came .
the moment he saw me , he hurled a question at me , &quot; Have you graduated ? &quot;
I said no .
but anyhow , I let him know all our doubts about the terms .
he refu@@ ted all of them , saying they were not problems at all .
I doubted what he said .
and this man - by the way , he was from Northeast China .
he even asked a down payment of Rmb@@ 200,000 , or else , he said threat@@ en@@ ingly , we &apos;d better quit .
his reaction made me even more suspicious of him .
but I said nothing .
when the talk was over at about 10 o &apos;clock that night , on our way home .
I told Uncle Li , &quot; This is a sc@@ am . you &apos;d better quit it . &quot;
I tried to use all my legal knowledge to talk some sense into him .
but obviously I failed .
there was hesitation in his eyes when he said , &quot; I &apos;ve followed up on this project for three to five years .
future returns could qu@@ intu@@ ple or even dec@@ u@@ ple the cost .
that &apos;s quite possible . &quot;
so I had to let him go .
it seems that you have already made up your mind .
I think I &apos;d better go home now , &quot; I said .
two years after that , I learned from my brother that Uncle Li was cheated out of RMB 2 million to 3 million in the deal .
and he has been avoiding me ever since .
so here is what I want to say : having some , or even a little .
legal knowledge will always keep you sane and protect you from being tempted into traps .
you know how life is full of traps everywhere .
many of us might easily associate law with some ordinary civil disputes .
actually , law can play a very important role in commercial battles .
there is a very famous case you might know .
in 2008 , as the financial crisis rec@@ eded .
it was reported that some multinational giants were making a bid to acquire China Hui@@ yuan Ju@@ ice Group Ltd .
the media were largely optimistic about the acquisition .
the large buy@@ out would allow Zhu Xin@@ li , Hui@@ yuan &apos;s boss , to retire comfortably on over 10 billion Hong Kong dollars .
he could h@@ ence@@ forward focus on the upstream and spend more time with his granddaughter .
Hui@@ yuan was a mainland company listed in Hong Kong .
the news of the acquisition instantly sent its share price roc@@ keting to over ten Hong Kong dollars .
but unlike things in other countries , there was no room for arbitr@@ age in China .
what happened later , however , was quite contrary to people &apos;s expectations .
the acquisition didn &apos;t happen .
do you know why ?
the reason was quite simple : anti @-@ monopoly .
but why did anti @-@ monopoly grounds wi@@ eld such a large influence on the whole thing ?
because the Anti @-@ Mon@@ opol@@ y Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce ( MOFCOM ) and Coca @-@ Cola didn &apos;t agree on a restrictive condition .
the whole world suspected that the Chinese government was just using anti @-@ monopoly as a pretext to dispel foreign investment and protect its domestic businesses .
that was so wrong .
MOFCOM could win the &quot; P@@ oo@@ rest S@@ cap@@ e@@ goat Prize &quot; that year .
as we in@@ siders know , it was not MOFCOM .
but rather Coca @-@ Cola , the buyer , that finally rejected the deal .
the deal asked for a PE R@@ atio of 42 after 2008 , which deter@@ red Coca @-@ Cola .
it decided to quit .
but how ?
to quit would mean a breach of contract .
which would cause a large contractual penalty .
but Coca @-@ Cola found a loop@@ hole in the contract .
there was no break@@ up fee clause like what foreign contracts always have .
people working in investment banks must know that break@@ up fee clauses are very common in take@@ overs .
if you back out of the deal , even if you &apos;re forced to do that on anti@@ monopoly grounds .
you have to pay a break@@ up fee that could amount to 5 % to 10 % of the entire acquisition price .
that would be a huge amount .
I later had a chance to learn that actually a break@@ up fee clause did exist in the beginning .
it also took the anti @-@ monopoly authority &apos;s disapproval into account .
only that it was revoked at the last moment .
why was that ?
because both parties thought such deals would definitely be approved .
all the procedures for approval were just to@@ ken@@ ism .
so what happened after that ?
the absence of the break@@ up fee clause proved to be an &quot; Ach@@ illes heel . &quot;
seizing upon this loop@@ hole , Coca @-@ Cola was able to quit un@@ sc@@ athed .
suppose the clause had been preserved , how much more money would go into Mr. Zhu &apos;s pocket ?
let &apos;s make it 8 % of the total worth of 14 billion Hong Kong dollars .
that would be one billion Hong Kong dollars at the least .
the loss of one clause cost him ten billion Hong Kong dollars .
so lawyers are actually very important , right ?
that is a typical example in battles of commercial interest .
my clients sometimes will advise me to take things easy .
they will say , &quot; Mr. Dai , I guess the contract is clear enough .
it &apos;s OK . &quot;
and I will reply , &quot; Let &apos;s make it perfect just in case . &quot;
they might then doubt the odds of unfavorable conting@@ encies .
but I &apos;ll tell them that I &apos;ve seen so many of them as a lawyer and if they want to try their luck .
then they will leave me alone .
another story is also related with law .
Hua@@ wei , as you all know , is a Chinese tech giant .
but for years in the past even such an outstanding company as Hua@@ wei was also having a hard time being bul@@ lied by foreign patent trol@@ ls and NP@@ Es .
those NP@@ Es always claimed a lot of patents .
they tended to force any terms they wanted on their partners by threatening to back out of the deal if their needs were not met .
never ha@@ ggle over the license fee and never ask for more than I offered .
&quot; they were just so over@@ bearing .
and it seemed as if they could not be bound by any existing law , be it the Contract Law or the Regulations on Administration of Import and Export of Technologies .
Chinese companies suffered but endured , until one day they found a chance to fight back .
the moment the Anti @-@ Mon@@ opol@@ y Law of China was introduced , Hua@@ wei realized that its opportunity came .
it filed lawsuits against ID@@ C , who violated the Anti @-@ Mon@@ opol@@ y Law .
won the trials and received RMB@@ 20 million , a small sum though it might seem to be , in compensation .
the licensing model was thus changed .
thereby inval@@ idating many unreasonable old terms and spar@@ ing room for more new terms .
what does that mean ?
it means law can even change the business model and help businesses reap more benefits in commercial battles .
some of us here might ask , &quot; Does that have anything to do with me ? &quot;
sure it does .
you might know that in 20@@ 13 , 20@@ 14 and 2015 .
the anti @-@ monopoly law enforcement authorities launched several cracks down on the illegal acts of the providers of liquor , pow@@ dered milk , glasses and automobiles .
do you have a feeling that the pow@@ dered milk is cheaper ?
so are the glasses .
the automobile spare parts provided by the 4@@ S stores are also cheaper .
do you feel that ?
I guess we must feel that law has benefited us in a noticeable manner .
it is my 12th year being a lawyer .
many of my friends try to talk me into starting my own business , or finding a franchise opportunity .
they will say to me , &quot; Ken , being a lawyer is just tough .
choosing the right spot , even a big can fly .
so just get out . &quot;
surely they never want me to become a big .
they just want me to fly higher .
but I tell them that being a lawyer makes me happy .
I am having a lot of fun .
why do I say that ?
because my occupation allows me to meet people from different walks of life and have a glimpse into how different businesses work .
we must keep learning and move on with the times .
among the people I meet , there are very rich entrepreneurs , un@@ fairly @-@ treated ordinary people .
and also friends who want to seek my advice on their marriage or other practical matters .
when they become my clients , I will then see a book of vivid life stories unfolding before me .
some stories are beautiful , some are lucky , and some , of course , are piti@@ able .
and being a lawyer sometimes feels like doing a role play , Which gives me a lot of fun .
it is a peaceful age and I don &apos;t have to fight in a battle .
sometimes when I am doing a cross @-@ border anti @-@ monopoly investigation .
I will feel like a commander @-@ in @-@ chief commanding from the headquarters and having everything in my control .
it makes me very proud sometimes if I can help my clients recover a loss of tens of millions of RMB through a mere phone call or a suggestion .
other times when I have to deal with a lawsuit or an arbitration case on behalf of my clients , I will feel like a film producer and a director .
you know , I must write the complaint or the statement of defense , just like the way a play@@ w@@ right writes a story .
and then , I must also dictate my story to the arbitr@@ ator , or the judge .
when the court is in session , my role will then begin to alternate between the male lead and the supporting male role .
but certainly sometimes I could also end up as a mere walk @-@ on .
that &apos;s decided by the different requirements of the cases .
being a lawyer is also a good way to experience what others might rarely have a chance to experience . trust me .
there is a question frequently posed by my friends or even by myself .
&quot; what does law mean in today &apos;s Chinese society ? &quot;
what &apos;s the essence of it ?
I keep thinking about this question .
but I can &apos;t find a perfect answer .
I only feel increasingly sure that law is very important for us , for the ordinary people .
law can protect our freedom .
it can also safeguard our rights .
only with its protection can we live in this country feeling more reas@@ sured , without worrying that our house will be reclaimed , or our parking space in the neighborhood will be taken by others .
wealth gained in accordance with the law makes us feel safe .
and of course the law can also help us remain rational and skeptical and thus we won &apos;t get lost .
you know there are so many sc@@ ams .
but why people are so ready to be fooled ?
there are old traps like illegal fund raising , and also some new traps .
the essential reason why people believe those tricks is that they just lose their head in front of the promised giant benefits .
but if they arm themselves with a bit of legal knowledge , or consult more experienced friends .
they might more or less have some sense and are thus less likely to get lost and be sc@@ ammed .
that &apos;s what I think about the role of law .
as the big data age comes , people begin to worry about their privacy .
but I believe the government will strengthen efforts to protect our privacy .
there might be a day when , even if we know our neighbor &apos;s phone number .
we just dare not disclose it to anyone else for no good reason .
some friends usually say to me .
&quot; our law is just so underdeveloped , and so many things are missing . &quot;
that &apos;s true , if we compare China with some developed countries .
but I remember a famous American economist Milton Fried@@ man once said that what was scarce was not resources .
but the right understanding and handling of the reality .
so let me borrow his words here and say .
what &apos;s scarce in China is not laws or regulations , but our deep understanding and right use of the law .
right ?
well , I &apos;ve said so much about law .
to sum up , law is actually very close to us , and also very important for us .
it is so important that sometimes its value el@@ udes us .
but of@@ t@@ enti@@ mes , some five or ten years later , the true value of a law might reveal itself and you might suddenly realize that actually the entire society has been receiving benefits from that law all the time .
take the famous US Constitution , everyone thinks highly of it .
do you know why it was introduced in the first place ?
because the parties needed a tool for their partisan fights .
that the Constitution could have gone this far must be beyond everyone &apos;s expectation .
that &apos;s true .
my friends sometimes worry about where a law should be going and they will ask for my opinion .
I can only tell them that I don &apos;t know either .
it &apos;s like being a parent .
you have a baby boy and you just want him to grow .
you can never know what he is going to become , seriously , nor that you could control it .
but I always believe that when people begin to realize the importance of the law , or no longer view the law as a far@@ away thing , or see the law as something more than just law .
then great progress will be made in our society even without our knowing it .
it &apos;s my dream , which I think is worth having even though it might be hard to be fulfilled .
after all , experience itself is wealth , and sometimes the journey itself , rather than the destination , is the best part .
thank you !
hello there !
I &apos;m Hu Tao , founder and CEO of X@@ e@@ on@@ o .
as a man at a marri@@ ag@@ eable age .
I currently have two focuses in my daily life .
one is trying all means to make my girlfriend say &quot; Yes , I do , &quot; which is very very important .
the other is football .
I spent seven years maj@@ oring in chemistry at Tsinghua University .
during that period , I also studied economics at Peking University for 3 years .
after that , I went abroad and studied at University of Rochester , where I got my MS@@ c in finance .
later , I worked both in Silicon Valley and China , engaged in venture capital industry as an appren@@ tice .
just an appren@@ tice , not investor .
during that process , I tried to do my job well and at the same time paid close attention to entrepreneurs from China , the USA .
Israel and India to draw on their merits .
when people learnt about my educational background .
they became curious about my entrepreneurial orientation and asked me , &quot; Why did you choose football ? &quot;
this is a very interesting question .
to me , football brings me unique attributes .
first , it brings me more freedom .
whether at school or at work , every time when I step onto the pitch .
I always feel absolute freedom .
yes , absolute freedom .
I can run freely on the pitch , passing and kicking the ball .
however much work pressure imposed on me , I can just sweep it from my mind for the moment .
football brings me a lot of pleasure .
on the one hand , such a pleasure comes from dop@@ amine naturally released after sports .
on the other hand , having one or two dozens of men united to fight for one common goal itself is already a merit .
whether it turns out to be a win or loss .
it &apos;s all about the process and the mutual understanding , respect and appreciation therein .
just so marvelous .
also , when playing football , you need to keep pressing on steadfastly and overcome your weakness .
that would bring you a great sense of fulfillment .
if you &apos;ve ever played a football game .
you &apos;d understand that you reach physical limits twice respectively about 30 and 70 minutes later .
that &apos;s an awful experience .
second , football shows me the importance of cooperation .
for both a football team and a venture team alike , always remember to complain less and contribute more .
and also give more tolerance and encouragement to your teammates .
only by doing so can you advance ahead together .
many times , perseverance helps transform a teenager into a grown @-@ up with a sense of responsibility .
third , football teaches me how to respect all .
by respecting all , I mean respecting your teammates , your opponents , the refe@@ rees and rules of the game .
yet , respecting rules is a virtue in dire need in this era .
I also wanna say through football .
we can experience the feeling of being respected .
in the autumn of 2012 , I joined the football team of our Business School in a football league for American business schools held at Dar@@ t@@ mouth .
in the first match vs .
MIT , I was attacked by an opponent at my nose , which resulted in nasal cartilage fracture .
with a simple dressing , I returned to the pitch the next day and fought with my teammates .
with joint efforts , we eventually won the game .
after that , I discovered that the previous subtle barrier and e@@ strang@@ ement between me and those Americans abruptly disappeared without a trace .
thus it can be seen that in a country or culture that advocates sport@@ s@@ manship .
one best way to make friends is to play tough and fairly with them on the pitch .
in fact , the charm of football originates from mathematics .
as Liu ci@@ xin , author of the Three Body Problem put it .
when you watch a football match at the last row of the upper deck .
you overlook the specific movement of each football@@ er and see a clear matrix consisting of 23 dots .
you cannot expect to find such a clear matrix elsewhere .
the complexity of the matrix , along with the complexity of change in each individual , contributes to the uncertainty of a match .
such an uncertainty is the very root of the charm of football .
from a commercial perspective , football is an industry with high value of output .
its global output value had already exceeded USD 500 billion three years ago .
that would make football industry the 16th place on the list of world economies .
there has been a debate over which one is the No.1 sport . basketball or football ?
the market size speaks for itself .
football &apos;s market size is larger than the combined size of the 2nd , 3rd , 4th and 5th largest sports .
globally , a total of 270 million people are engaged in football @-@ related jobs .
they account for 4 % of world population .
and there are 1.6 billion football fans worldwide .
so football is a well @-@ deserved No.1 sport in the world .
the Rio Olympic Games just ended a few days ago .
and I guess for all Chinese , the most exciting moment of the Games came when our women &apos;s volleyball team , led by Lang Ping , won the championship .
and many people might naturally associate it with Chinese men &apos;s football team .
for years , our national men &apos;s football team has had consistent performance .
I mean continued poor performance .
which makes them a laugh@@ ing@@ stock among Chinese people .
what &apos;s wrong with the team ?
is it because of the Chinese football &apos;s insufficient marke@@ tization ?
does this mean current dilemma can only be solved through complete marke@@ tization ?
my answer is &quot; No . &quot;
quite to the opposite , I attribute the success of women &apos;s volleyball team to the effective &quot; whole @-@ nation system &quot; and the failure of men &apos;s football team to the failed marke@@ tization .
why do I say so ?
because the &quot; whole @-@ nation system &quot; ensures a sound and complete talent supply system for the Chinese women &apos;s volleyball team .
thanks to that , a country girl like Zhu Ting was able to step by step get promoted from municipal team to provincial team and eventually to national team , becoming a top outside h@@ itter worldwide .
meanwhile , the &quot; whole @-@ nation system &quot; also equi@@ ps Lang Ping with a grand coaching staff of 15 members .
which is simply un@@ imaginable elsewhere .
what has marke@@ tization brought to Chinese football ?
basically a total mess .
the Chinese Super League seems booming in recent years .
sky @-@ high transfer fees , coach wages and broadcast costs keep emerging .
yet , sorry I have to say capital is both profit @-@ driven and short @-@ sighted .
there are four core aspects determining the overall level of Chinese football .
they are campus football , amateur football , football academy and U + teams of top football clubs .
China is weak in all of the four aspects .
without any unified planning , the four aspects are isolated from each other .
besides , there isn &apos;t any influential inter@@ collegi@@ ate football league or amateur league .
so the basis of the Chinese football is very very weak .
let &apos;s have a look at how many football fields there are in China , across the 9.@@ 6 million k@@ m@@ 2 territory , China only has a little more than ten thousand football fields in total .
many of which are not open to the public .
for example , of the over 500 fields in Nanjing , only some 50 fields are open to local citizens .
and in Shanghai , there is only one football field per 12@@ 0,000 citizens .
compared with developed countries , such figures are too &quot; miserable &quot; to present .
yet , mind you , the per capita field area of Shanghai is still higher than our national average .
there &apos;s a UK website specializing in helping locate football fields .
let &apos;s take a community of London as the center and search for fields with a radius of 20 miles .
how many fields can we find ?
there are 2,@@ 0@@ 18 fields .
anything else you &apos;ve noticed ?
for every football field , there &apos;s more than one pitch .
let &apos;s have a try with our X@@ e@@ on@@ o app .
take where we are as the center and search the number of fields throughout Shanghai .
our data collection is the most accurate possible .
and the search result shows over 300 fields .
that &apos;s a stark contrast .
besides , of the 300 fields , not many are open to the public .
there is an even sev@@ e@@ rer shortage of football coaches . China only had over 8,000 qualified coaches for j@@ uni@@ ors &quot; football , according to the statistics released one or two years ago .
just 8,000 coaches .
I actually don &apos;t have much confidence in our overall system of coach training .
because its quality control is not so convincing .
many people , including Diego Mar@@ ad@@ ona wondered how come China just couldn &apos;t select 11 nice @-@ looking guys with top football skills out of its 1.3 billion population .
how come ?
the answer is quite simple .
let &apos;s see .
how many Chinese people are engaged in football professionally ?
according to CF@@ A &apos;s 20@@ 13 statistics , there were only 30 thousand registered football population .
come on . even Thailand , a much smaller country , had 280 thousand football population .
OK ?
in this sense , our men &apos;s football team &apos;s 5 : 1 loss to Thailand did not seem that outrageous .
to say nothing of our loss to a super football power like Germany .
so what really matters here is not the entire population of a country .
but its football population .
also , I have to say that the cultural value of a society also matters .
for thousands of years , China has been a country putting mental pursuits above material arts .
consequently , physical education has been underestimated by many .
another thing is over the past two decades .
no positive image has emerged in Chinese football community .
what comes to our mind when we talk about Chinese football ?
&quot; black whistle &quot; refe@@ rees , imprisoned cor@@ rup@@ tive officials , match fixing , and so on .
is there anything positive that you can think of ?
sports icons like Lang Ping and Yao Ming are in dire need by Chinese football .
let &apos;s see a football icon overseas .
he must be familiar to many girls , because he &apos;s handsome .
he &apos;s Mi@@ ros@@ la@@ v K@@ lose .
here &apos;s something about him .
he was born in 1978 in Poland and emigr@@ ated to Germany with his parents when he was nine .
later , due to his poor German , he could only attend a vocational school , instead of high school . at 18 , he was painting the wall all day long .
at 20 , he eventually became a professional football@@ er at a lower German league .
it was in 1998 .
also in the same year , Ronaldo Lu@@ iz , who &apos;s two years older , already helped Brazil finish runner @-@ up at the 1998 World Cup .
had he played at his normal level , Brazil would have been the champion .
anyway , K@@ lose was strict with himself .
he drank little and had no scandal .
later , at the 20@@ 14 World Cup in Brazil , Ronaldo Lu@@ iz &apos;s motherland , K@@ lose surpassed Ronaldo and became the top sco@@ rer of all time in World Cup final games .
more importantly , Germany won the championship .
also at the Brazil World Cup , Germany defeated Brazil 7 : 1 .
what a shame !
in private life , K@@ lose is a well @-@ behaved man , as well .
at 25 , he had the first girlfriend and married her .
later , they gave birth to very lovely twins .
he even transferred to another football club as a protest against local fans &quot; dis@@ respect of his wife .
he &apos;d get up at 5 in the morning to make breakfast and change di@@ apers for kids .
his private virtue is almost im@@ pec@@ cable .
I &apos;m not here to intentionally de@@ i@@ fy him .
I just admire him .
how lucky German kids are for having such a great football@@ er as their role model .
we &apos;ve already noticed some problems we are faced with .
how should we tackle them ?
in five years , we , or our great motherland will send a detector to the Mars .
to be frank , I think to some extent improving the level of Chinese football is even tougher than that .
nevertheless , there &apos;s always a solution to any systematic problem .
we &apos;d better look for some existing cost @-@ efficient solutions for reference .
and I think we can learn a lot from the successful systems of Japan and Germany .
first of all , let &apos;s have a look at the football system of Japan .
the football system of Japan is based on four core elements .
the first and also the most primary one is its campus football system .
followed by its amateur club league , national system of training centers under Japan Football Association ( J@@ FA ) and its professional club league .
of the four elements , campus football system is the most essential of all .
and it has created a large talent pool for the entire football industry of Japan .
also , J@@ FA has increased the efficiency of talent screening by establishing over 500 training centers across the country .
these training centers fall into four levels .
the lowest level is roughly equal to the county or municipal level of China .
the third level comprises 48 training centers in 48 administrative divisions equal to our provinces .
the second level comprises nine training centers in nine major regions .
which are similar to our regions such as north China and northeast China .
the highest level is national @-@ level , comprising one national training center .
school football clubs in each region select their most promising young players to corresponding regional training centers .
which again train and select the best few from those players to corresponding national U + teams of Japan , or to the U + teams of a professional club .
in this way , Japan has formed a sound and effective talent selection system .
which has no equivalence in China .
it is noteworthy that the pur@@ port of Japanese campus football is not about competition , but about fun .
early in 1976 , the M@@ EX@@ T already included football into its education program .
right from the very beginning , they &apos;ve defined football as a so @-@ called &quot; scoring &quot; game .
whose pur@@ port is to bring fun and joy of teamwork to kids through possession , passing and scoring .
in practical training , they manage to keep consistency .
more specifically , students from age 6 to age 16 are arranged into different 2 @-@ year levels .
for each level , the coaches execute unified training standards .
such a consistency ensures that no correction or readjustment is needed for football@@ ers transferred from elsewhere .
thanks to this complete , extensive and efficient training system .
talented football@@ ers have kept emerging in Japan .
talented football@@ ers have kept emerging in Japan .
although China has a super league matches of Chinese college student .
but it fails to attract much attention .
by contrast , Japan has a sound and complete league system .
this system consists of nine regional leagues , each of which has four levels .
each level has 12 teams .
in total , there are more than 400 football teams .
each of which plays 40 @-@ 50 matches per year .
you know the experience of playing real games matters a lot to the improvement of one &apos;s performance .
football popularization in lower age groups is even better .
for primary @-@ school group ( aged below 12 ) , the football population is close to 300,000 .
for middle @-@ school group , the figure is about 23@@ 0,000 @-@ 250,000 .
for high @-@ school group , the figure is almost 17@@ 0,000 .
the point is , they not only have a large football population but also have corresponding leagues for different age groups .
there are two national leagues for primary school students , ten for middle school students and seven for high school students .
such an extensive coverage enables every talented young player to stand out and reach their full potential .
benefiting from its effective training system .
every year , some 70 % of new professional football@@ ers in Japan come directly from universities and high schools .
this is simply un@@ imaginable in China .
let me give two most striking examples .
one plays for Inter Milan and the other for AC Milan .
the right one . um , sorry , the right one is Yu@@ to Nag@@ atom@@ o .
how is he like ?
he used to be a rebellious teen .
in his high @-@ school years , he often went to game rooms to play t@@ ai@@ ko no T@@ at@@ su@@ jin , a drum@@ ming game .
then he entered university .
he &apos;s a smart guy and was admitted to M@@ ei@@ ji University , a renowned key university of Japan , where he fell in love with football .
however , his performance was not recognized by his coach .
for which he could only do what he &apos;s good at , i.e. beating the drum in the cheering squad of their university team .
whenever he had time , he &apos;d learn from the coach and polish his football skills .
in the sop@@ hom@@ ore year , his hard training paid off .
he made remarkable progress and became a center @-@ back .
given his height , the center @-@ back position was a nightmare for him .
he &apos;s no taller than 17@@ 0@@ cm .
in the junior year , he joined the national team of Japan to participate in the Summer Uni@@ versi@@ ade and had outstanding performance .
upon graduation , he was signed by F.@@ C. Tokyo , a football club on par with our Shanghai Shen@@ hua and Beijing Guo &apos;an .
can you imagine it ?
a freshman wearing a Japanese head@@ band was beating the drum in the cheer squad .
but when he graduated from university .
he immediately turned into a professional football@@ er .
this is the magic of Japan &apos;s football training system .
another similar case is Ke@@ is@@ u@@ ke Honda .
when he was at primary and middle school , he joined Osaka &apos;s youth system .
but he performed poorly and therefore got eliminated .
following that , he was admitted to a very famous Japanese high school , where he continued playing football .
during the three years at high school , he led his team to win multiple league championships .
in 2004 , his performance attracted the attention from J@@ FA and J. League .
which picked him as 2004 J.@@ League designated special player .
what does that mean ?
it means a J. League club was designated to train him .
he was thus sent to Nag@@ o@@ ya Gr@@ am@@ pus .
upon graduation from high school .
he immediately became a professional football@@ er .
in 2008 , he transferred to Holland and in 2011 to P@@ FC CS@@ K@@ A Moscow .
in 20@@ 13 , he joined Inter , no@@ pe , AC Milan on a free transfer and became its central midfielder in the No.@@ 10 shirt .
as we see , Japan &apos;s university and high school football systems are indeed very effective .
let &apos;s now turn to Germany .
Germany is traditionally a major football power .
all youth training systems across Europe originate in England .
Germany has sound and complete systems of campus , professional and amateur club leagues , engaging a large population playing football .
after consecu@@ tively getting eliminated at the group stage in two major events in 1998 and 2000 , German football community had a self @-@ reflection .
they didn &apos;t think their football population small .
the problem was , according to them , they just couldn &apos;t pick exceptionally talented ones out .
talent screening is definitely not something depending solely on market force .
so , Deut@@ sch@@ er F@@ us@@ s@@ ball @-@ Bun@@ d ( D@@ F@@ B ) took the initiative to set up 3@@ 90 football training bases evenly distributed across the country .
each training base serves over 70 football clubs nearby .
local football clubs spot most talented kids and send them to those training bases .
where they will get trained and screened by the D@@ F@@ B coaches .
the most promising ones will be sent to corresponding national and FC U + teams .
in 20@@ 14 , when Germany won the World Cup , some 60 % of its national team players came from that youth training system .
among them were household names such as Thomas M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler , Mes@@ ut Ö@@ z@@ il and Marco Re@@ us .
they &apos;re all from that system .
we have touched upon so many problems and covered so many successful cases .
what should we do ?
first , the government should play a leading role in some aspects .
after all , football , to a large extent , is not a market behavior .
for example , the promotion of campus and amateur football , regardless of training or league system , must be dominated by the government .
this is particularly true of campus football .
regarding the development of amateur football system .
the government should at least play a guiding role in improving the existing amateur football system .
in fact , as a football @-@ related startup , we &apos;ve already had some knowledge of this market .
and we can feel that football industry is on the rise , with significant grow@@ ths in football@@ ers , football clubs and leagues .
so under such circumstances , the government should appropriately guide the development , sort out problems and shape the system to create a more favorable football environment .
in terms of football field construction , the government should certainly play a dominant role .
why ?
as a business man , if I have a piece of 20 mu land in a city like Beijing , Shanghai or Shenzhen , how will I develop it ?
should I develop a couple of residential buildings and sell them at RMB 100,000 / m@@ 2 , or should I build a football field ?
there &apos;s no need for a second thought .
of course I should develop residential buildings .
right ?
that &apos;s why the government should play a dominant role in this regard .
and I look forward to our government &apos;s action .
we can actually see the power of government subsidies .
last year , there &apos;s a drastic increase in football fields in the city of Chengdu , China .
how come ?
because Chengdu Municipal People &apos;s Government subsidized the building of new fields .
so the government only needs to give a push and the market will respond accordingly .
second , the government should take the lead in promoting coaching staff training .
in this regard , there &apos;re many real problems .
for instance , last year the Ministry of Education selected over 200 football coaches and sent them to France to receive training .
however , French trainers were surprised to find that not many of them really know how to play football .
they wondered what they were in France for .
in fact , this promotion task is much easier said than done .
but that surely needs government support .
it cannot be enabled by social capital .
last , there &apos;s one more thing I &apos;m sure all of you present here can do .
that is to attach more importance to physical education .
graduating from a sports university , I have a deep understanding of it .
at our university , there &apos;s a slogan of &quot; Keep healthy and work for our motherland for 50 years . &quot;
actually , sports can keep us healthy so that we can work for our motherland for 50 years and also contribute more to our family .
do you agree ?
plus , some of my friends engaged in youth system frankly told me that kids , particularly those spo@@ ilt and naughty kids .
would change dramatically after receiving systematic football training .
if you are a parent , you can have a try .
it works and works well .
what can we do as an individual ?
for men , the answer is simple .
just play more and watch more .
of course , take care and don &apos;t get hurt .
right ?
then just enjoy the pure fun of playing football .
for women , if your boyfriend loves playing football , please be more tolerant .
after all , football is good for health .
as long as it &apos;s good for health , it &apos;s good for life and work .
isn &apos;t it ?
if you have kids , you can have a try and send them to a youth training center .
where they can develop a team spirit and become stronger and more self @-@ reliant .
that &apos;s good for them .
last , I &apos;d like to share a story with you .
in the autumn of 2012 , I visited a friend ( Mickey ) in the USA .
his family lived in a small town in Massachusetts .
it &apos;s a remote town .
there were six members in his family , with the youngest being his sister H@@ anna .
she &apos;s a pretty girl and was at middle school .
H@@ anna played for her middle school football team . on Sunday , they had a match against a team from a nearby town .
the night before the match .
Mickey &apos;s parents were busy preparing sun@@ shade , deck chairs , food , drinks and all those stuff .
the next morning , the whole family drove to the field and put everything in place .
then the kids were playing football and running on the pitch while the coach was standing by one side , shouting advice .
and those kids &quot; parents in sun glasses were sitting around the pitch , cheering them on while enjoying snacks .
plus , the weather was particularly nice that day .
the scene was so impressive and so sweet .
I just want to say if one day a picture like that also becomes part of our ordinary life .
we will not have to worry about the prospects of Chinese football anymore .
so much for my presentation .
thank you all !
hello , everyone .
I &apos;m Xu Xun from B@@ G@@ I .
today the topic I &apos;m going to share with you is the origin of life and the rules of life that everyone is concerned about .
perhaps everyone knows that genes are the source code of life .
perhaps when we were little , we asked our parents where are we from ?
long afterward , we know that we are not picked from the garbage can but are created by the human 3D printing .
so I &apos;ve been asking , how does this 3D printer know .
where is my nose and where is my eye ?
in fact , what &apos;s behind the 3D printer is actually the source code of life .
we inherit from both parents our genetic materials .
the combination of sper@@ ms and eggs , the most critical intermediate process .
is actually the exchange and re@@ combination of genetic materials , forming a new life .
everyone &apos;s source code is different .
which is why every one of us is different and unique .
moreover , not only are the source codes different between us .
but the whole world of life around us is controlled by source codes , and these source codes are also different .
it is this difference that has created this colorful world .
many of the changes in our source code can actually cause errors .
we also know that in the southern part of China and in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces .
one of the nine people in the population carries such an error .
such an error ultimately led to the lack of oxygen @-@ carrying capacity of the whole red blood cells .
and ultimately led to these children unable to grow up as lively and healthy as ordinary children .
such changes can also lead to more serious diseases , such as cancer .
in China , more than 4 million cancers are discovered every year .
what &apos;s the cause of the cancer ?
cancer is actually caused by source code errors that eventually lead to the loss of control .
for example , P@@ 53 is a simple gene .
the loss of a small segment of this gene leads to the activation of the whole cancer pathway .
which eventually leads to the occurrence of cancer .
so actually this error is so very terrible .
so we thought , since the source code is so important .
we must interpret it so that we can get a handle on it .
so there is one thing we need to do .
that is , to test out the code , which we call sequencing .
how do we do it ?
in fact , the source code of this gene has only 4 characters AT@@ CG .
just like the characters 0 and 1 used in our computer to replace all information .
and the combination of long sequences of AT@@ CG lead to the basic composition of all the source code .
what kind of material does the source code AT@@ CG lie in ?
it &apos;s a substance we call DNA .
which may be the most efficient storage system in the world today .
a 1.5 p@@ g of DNA contains nearly 3 billion bases and contains all the codes of birth , sen@@ ility , illness and death .
it may be difficult for many people to imagine how heavy 1.5 p@@ g is .
if it is calculated by 1@@ g DNA , the information it contains can reach Z@@ B level .
what does this level mean ?
at this level , it might be enough to store all the Internet data that have been gathered around the world .
so this is a valid storage system .
its character spacing is only 0.@@ 34 nan@@ ometers .
which is much better than our current 10 @-@ nan@@ ometer technology level in any semiconductor industry .
this is a very complicated system , and it &apos;s an arduous task to interpret it .
we had more than 200 scientists from six countries who spent 13 years and $ 3 billion on interpreting the first human genome , and finally made it .
of course , with the development of technology .
we have been able to test out the genome more easily and quickly .
now everyone can have their own genome results .
how do they get it ?
DNA lies in the cell nucleus of the cell .
first , we take out the DNA from the cell nucleus .
but DNA is so long that it contains a sequence of billions of bases .
therefore , to simplify our work .
the sequence are broken into small bits of segments .
then we make it into a structure that repl@@ icates my DNA thousands of times .
the purpose of replication is to ampli@@ fy the signal .
so that my signal can be ampli@@ fied 1000 times , and it will be easier to read .
in this way , thousands of DNA can be ent@@ angled with each other to form a nan@@ osphere .
which can eventually be placed on a sequencing chip for sequencing .
when sequencing , we mark the four bases AT@@ CG with different colors .
so that we can read out the sequence of the bases in sequence .
like I &apos;ve just mentioned , they are very small fragments .
and then we put together hundreds of millions of fragments and finally assemble the final genome of the person .
this is a very critical breakthrough in un@@ locking the code of life .
since we can read , we also would like to write .
of course , writing is what we human beings do all the time .
from the beginning of the agricultural civilization , we &apos;ve been trying to play the role of God and have been doing the work of re@@ writing the genome and source code .
in the laboratory , we have a more efficient way of introducing the gene from a foreign source .
for example , we transfer the fluorescent protein from j@@ elly@@ fish into mice to conduct functional experiments .
recently , gene editing has become a hot topic .
how does gene editing work ?
gene editing is a very precise way to modify bases to create something like a character error or a missing sequence like I mentioned .
perhaps in the future we are able to use this more precise method of gene therapy to treat diseases .
so the reason why gene editing is so popular is that it brings about new hope to cure diseases .
after we &apos;ve mastered these coding rules .
what humans are eager to do most is to create their own lives and write their own code from scratch .
synthetic biology is a science of writing artificial code from scratch .
we have succeeded in writing the whole artificial code of bacterial pro@@ kar@@ y@@ ote .
at the same time , we are also working on writing the genome of artificial yeast .
so , in the future , it can be imagined that with our ability to read and write .
our capacity to transform rules and fate will become more powerful .
what we want to do further is to benefit mankind with these technologies .
in 2008 , we received a long letter written by a mother of an ich@@ thy@@ osis patient with her finger blood .
this ich@@ thy@@ osis patient &apos;s mother , herself is also an ich@@ thy@@ osis patient .
she has suffered a lot of pain , loneliness and misfortune in her life .
however , when she finally gave birth to her daughter .
she found that her daughter inherited the gene of the disease .
the mother was in great pain and fell deeply into self @-@ blame .
such tragic stories are happening every day and everywhere in China .
and a large number of babies are born with mental retard@@ ation and birth defects every year .
the proportion of birth defects in China is 5.6 % .
what does that mean ?
one out of every 20 new@@ bor@@ ns may be disabled in one way or another .
due to such birth defects , many families are reduced to poverty and these diseases lead to the misfortune of many families .
however , basically these diseases are caused by genetic errors .
and they can be completely solved by the current technology .
and we want to use our technology to help all families to have healthy babies .
so , we have launched a plan to prevent millions of families from birth defects .
with our technology , we try to change this situation and try to reduce birth defects in China .
so far , through our efforts , we have screened 600 different diseases .
and we have completed the screening of 1.5 million pregnant women and helped at least 8,000 families with birth defects to avoid misfortune .
I just talked about the birth defect , and it seems that it can be changed at the beginning of life .
but what about cancer ?
similarly , as a genome disease , cancer can actually get rid of such rules with the power of technology .
there are three beautiful celebrities shown on the big screen : An@@ ita Mu@@ i , Chen Xia@@ ox@@ u and Yao Be@@ ina .
they all died of cancer , which could have been changed with technology .
Angel@@ ina Jolie , as we all know , found out by genetic testing that she carried a mutation in BR@@ CA@@ 1 and that she had an 87 % risk of breast cancer .
so she decided at once to have bilateral breast resection to avoid breast cancer .
this technology can be widely promoted to benefit anybody who needs it .
this is the power of technology .
if somebody is diagnosed with cancer , since it &apos;s caused by the genetic error , therefore it can be changed .
but how do we do this ?
after you find out the wrong segment of the code , you can apply the targeted drug precisely to treat it .
of course , I think for cancer , it &apos;s better to strang@@ le it in the cradle at the early stage .
and I &apos;ve always been very enthusiastic about the free DNA detection technology .
I think this may eventually help eradicate cancer , or treat cancer like treating a cold .
what does that mean ?
we all know that it takes ten month &apos;s pregnancy to give birth to a new baby .
it also takes a long time from five or six years to a dozen years for the earliest cell mutation to become a cancer tissue .
however , when it grows into a state where it can be observed with ic@@ on@@ ography .
it has already reached the middle or terminal stage where no technologies can help .
if we can detect changes in the early stage when there are only a few cells .
as we do at the tenth week of pregnancy in the newborn screening ,
then treating cancer is not hard .
it can be achieved , why ?
because , like the newborn cell , cancer cell is rapidly growing .
cancer cells release the free DNA waste produced by their metabolism into the blood .
the waste of the whole body is collected by the circul@@ atory system and is finally gathered in the blood .
so we can detect this mutation , which is extremely low in the blood , to monitor and prevent cancer at the early stage .
although the technology is still in its early stages .
I &apos;ve seen more hope for cancer treatment .
looking at the cases mentioned , it seems to us this technology has brought about an enormous breakthrough .
which has made tremendous changes in the way and rules of our whole life and the future .
right , the knowledge we have acquired so far has completely changed our understanding of the disease .
although we &apos;re able to dec@@ ip@@ her the genome now .
the genome region that we &apos;re able to explain accounts for no more than 1 % , and 99 % of the region is called &quot; the dark matter on the genome . &quot;
what does it mean ?
we know that the dark matter region does have its own functions .
but we don &apos;t know how they affect our life forms .
so what we are doing is trying to break through the limitation of human &apos;s understanding of genes .
we hope to truly grasp our own destiny and understand every character of our genome .
but the workload is very heavy .
everyone knows that to study an apple in AI .
you need to study a thousand or ten thousand apples .
similarly , if you would like to study the changes in a book of life .
you have to study tens of thousands or even millions of similar changes .
so we did a calculation .
if we want to get 1 % recognition of this new genome .
the amount of data at E@@ B to Z@@ B levels is required at least .
this is a huge amount of data , and basically it seems impossible .
so , in order to generate such big data .
we must have enough economical platforms and tools with high throughput and fast speed .
speaking of the high throughput , B@@ G@@ I has been known as the largest genome center in the world since five years ago when we bought 128 imported sequ@@ enc@@ ers and became the largest in the world .
with this improvement , we have made a lot of scientific discoveries and brought about great breakthroughs in the industry .
however , we &apos;ve also encountered choke points .
we &apos;re getting lots of attention because we are the top in the industry .
therefore , various obstacles are set for us in the development of technology , instrument maintaining , and price .
therefore , we deeply realized the bottleneck of rapid development brought by the lack of independent intellectual property rights and technology .
four years ago to this day , we spent four billion dollars on one thing .
what are we doing ?
we &apos;re developing our own sequ@@ enc@@ ers .
and we made it at the end of last year .
as you can see , we spent $ 3 billion working on the first human genome .
we spent $ 1.1 million on the first Chinese genome .
when we bought 128 imported sequ@@ enc@@ ers and became the world &apos;s largest genome center .
we still needed $ 10,000 for each genome , and at that time not every one could afford it .
when we released our first sequ@@ encer , the price dropped to $ 1,000 .
but this is far from our final goal and our pursuit .
we want the price to be lower .
how low should it be ?
we are working hard on the level of hundreds of dollars or even hundreds of yuan .
since we have our autonomous platform .
we generated the biggest data in the world .
so far , our sequ@@ enc@@ ers have tested about 10 million samples .
and more than 20@@ P@@ B data have been generated .
the statistics in the book called The Future by former U.S .
Vice President Gore showed that B@@ G@@ I produced more than 50 % of the world &apos;s genome data and that we contributed more than 70 % of the global agricultural data .
we produced so much data that we would certainly regard it as a treasure .
we would hide it in a corner or dig it out by ourselves as if it should be done according to the business logic .
but in fact , we didn &apos;t do so , why ?
because it is impossible to interpret this book of human on our own , with our limited capacities .
therefore , we did one thing .
we put the data we &apos;ve generated , the data we &apos;re about to generate , and all the data we &apos;re going to have in the future , in one place , a shared platform .
it is called the China National Gene Bank , which is the largest gene bank in the world .
this bank will be open to public on 2@@ 2nd of September .
the purpose of establishing this platform is to gather all the scientists and clever minds around the world to interpret the book of human , the genome .
although the road is full of twists and turns .
we &apos;ll make it if we really want to master the rules , our life code , and fully understand all the characters in our genome .
by that day , perhaps we will be able to achieve the ultimate human goal .
by that day , we may be able to make genetic technology truly beneficial to mankind .
by that day , maybe we are able to cure all diseases .
by that day , perhaps all of us can expect to live to 120 years old health@@ ily .
because in addition to the human genome , we also hold all books of life .
so we may be able to solve agricultural problems and famine .
and we &apos;ll be able to live in harmony with nature and build the so called cities of the future .
therefore , what we &apos;re doing now is not only due to the enthusiasm of a group of scientists for the origin of life .
but it is the biggest public welfare for all human beings in this world .
human beings have never ceased to explore their own origin , nor have they given up the pursuit of life .
from the al@@ chem@@ y of ancient emper@@ ors and Tao@@ ists to the Da Vinc@@ i Code , as a matter of fact , we have always been exploring on this road .
we &apos;re now doing the same thing .
what we do is to explore the password of the origin of life .
to help people get rid of the natural law of birth , sen@@ ility , illness and death , and finally to help human beings control their own fate .
that &apos;s all , thank you .
I am Zhu L@@ ili .
today I &apos;m going to talk about fan culture .
and the topic of my speech , as you can see on the screen , is &quot; Power , Games and R@@ ever@@ sal . &quot;
I am a researcher that studies fan culture myself .
speaking of fan culture , when we look back , shall we say that fan culture was only recently formed in our modern times ?
that &apos;s perhaps untrue ,
for sometimes when I talked with my father .
I found that their generation , too , had their own fan culture .
fan culture also exists among those born after 1970 , just like me .
so it is with the post @-@ 200@@ 0s generation , my daughter &apos;s generation .
nothing changes much , except that their idols are different from ours .
here I want to show you a clip from a TV drama that shows what a classical fan culture was like .
the name of the TV drama is &quot; The Grand Man@@ sion Gate , &quot; and it used to be very popular , right ?
the woman , Bai Yu@@ ting , who is played by the famous actress Jiang Wen@@ li , is a devoted fan here .
so who is her idol ?
a Peking opera star .
you can see the woman is so crazy that she even throws every piece of her jewelry at her idol on stage .
what later happens in the TV drama is even more unconventional .
the woman decides to marry the opera star .
she constantly visits him at the back stage and stal@@ ks him .
and finally after she learns that the star has no intention of marrying her .
and that her family would never tolerate such a humiliation of her marrying an opera actor , she mar@@ ries his portrait .
it depicts a classical fan culture that belonged to the old times after the Qing Dynasty .
which seems quite distant from us .
so why is it different from our modern fan culture then ?
I &apos;ll answer this question later .
for now I &apos;d like to show you some opening title sequences of &quot; Game and Th@@ r@@ ones . &quot;
the familiar music instantly brings us back to the iconic American TV series that has been accompanying us for almost ten years .
fans actually exist from old times to this day .
so what makes fans connect in the modern fan culture ?
personally I think there are two things that help them connect .
the first is the modern mass media .
it is owing to the mass media .
especially the global film industry , TV drama industry and music industry , that cultural experiences could be universally shared .
and so people are able to talk about or become fans of the same idol .
despite geographical borders or gener@@ ational gaps .
if we wind back the clock a little bit .
we might find that some Chinese people loved the Huang@@ mei opera , while some preferred the Sha@@ ox@@ ing opera .
the differences in language and cultural origin made a common idol impossible in old times .
the mass media industry in modern times , however , bridges the cultural gap and fo@@ sters the first group of modern fans of the mass culture .
and what &apos;s the second crucial thing that helps modern fans connect ?
the Internet .
if you were born after 1980 , especially after the years between 1985 and 1990 .
then congratulations , acad@@ em@@ ically you are termed as a &quot; digital ab@@ original . &quot;
because you were just born into a digital world .
those born after 1970 , like me , call themselves &quot; digital migrants . &quot;
for they have experienced many crucial moments of the media &apos;s evolution .
how can the &quot; digital ab@@ origin@@ als &quot; and &quot; digital migrants &quot; be connected ?
in the late 1990s an Internet @-@ based society came into being .
after that there came the social network .
then an interesting thing happened .
you know fans used to have very limited power .
and beside a limited number of familiar people like friends and family members , other people were out of our reach .
but now things are different .
with the social network , our browsing history can be saved .
fans &quot; hits are calculated , and the things they download and comments they make can be tracked .
you might notice that some famous portal platforms like Dou@@ ban and Zhi@@ hu at first were all a community for young people who shared the same interests .
as the young people gathered spontaneously .
the community gradually changed into a fan club , or a happy settlement bonded by the same interests .
those are what I think the two crucial things that help modern fans connect .
now here is a question I want to discuss with you .
personally I think a most important fact in modern times is that the power@@ lessness of fans is being reversed .
but why is that ?
as one of the earliest researchers in China that focused on fan culture .
I want to use the fans of the first season of Super Girl , an American I@@ do@@ l @-@ like show in China , as an example .
fans represented the power of the grassroots then , which was invested with a very profound meaning .
the public also wanted their voices to be heard by the mainstream of the society .
actually the age when Li Yu@@ chun was popular has not passed long .
it was merely over ten years or so , and even didn &apos;t reach 15 years .
during these years , we can find that fans &apos; power today even sur@@ passes what it was like in the Super Girl age .
what kind of age we are in ?
there are so many examples , but I &apos;ll just take one , in which the idol is actually fostered by fans .
it is about the fans of TF Bo@@ ys , a famous Chinese pop tri@@ o .
the interesting thing about TF Bo@@ ys &apos; fans is that there is a so @-@ called long @-@ distance intimacy between them , which is quite universal .
what does the word &quot; long @-@ distance intimacy &quot; mean ?
it means that people , who come from different places , don &apos;t know each other and have no connections in real life , have one thing in common .
they like the same idol .
love for this same idol bonds them together and makes them a group , or a community .
which is in many ways like a family .
in my research , I name this kind of intimacy the &quot; mimic intimate relationship . &quot;
as a term in sociology , an &quot; intimate relationship &quot; may refer to a family or a marriage .
only the relationship between parents and children , between a husband and a wife , or between two lovers , can be called &quot; intimate . &quot;
but that kind of intimacy also exists in the relationship between today &apos;s idols and their fans .
first , they are emotionally connected .
if you were never a fan of somebody .
you may never be able to imagine how far a fan &apos;s love can go .
take TF Bo@@ ys &apos; fans for example .
some of them send vill@@ as as gifts to their idol , or tickets for traveling around the world .
some even devote all their spare time to the promotional campaigns for the tri@@ o .
TF Bo@@ ys is a very special kind of idol group .
for in the very beginning it didn &apos;t catch much attention from the mainstream media .
it was only after the three boys won the &quot; F@@ av@@ or@@ ite Arti@@ st Prize &quot; at 20@@ 14 V Chart Awards that the mainstream media began to notice them .
fans manipulated the traffic all the way and helped the band rise to the top of the rankings .
until they hit the mainstream media as a very influential idol group .
such strong enthusiasm for an idol is perhaps beyond the understanding of those less dynamic fans like me .
another interesting thing is that fans begin to control .
traditionally idols are supposed to be in a position of strength , while fans play a weak role .
they &apos;ll just gaze at and love their idol from a distance .
in their whole life they might never have a chance to meet their idol in person .
or dream of building any ties with him or her .
what &apos;s interesting about the idols fostered by fans is that those idols are partly shaped by their fans .
generally those idols started out as teenagers .
whose half @-@ formed characteristics and even appearance are subject to changes in future .
on questions like how they should grow up , of what style their music should be and along which kind of path they should go .
fans are always ready to give their opinions in an over@@ powering manner .
such readiness to help , though seemingly over@@ powering .
first should be interpreted as a result of a strong emotion .
fans love and adore their idols .
just the way parents dote on their children .
so sometimes a very interesting thing happens .
some fans would label themselves &quot; mommy @-@ like fans &quot; or &quot; big @-@ sister @-@ like fans . &quot;
we can see that fans are becoming more powerful in controlling things about their idol .
so what &apos;s the third peculi@@ arity of the relationship between today &apos;s fans and their idols ?
intimacy .
fans have a say in what kind of songs their idol should sing and how they should look .
they even penetrate into the very private part of their idol &apos;s life .
for example , two years ago , when Kar@@ ry Wang , a member of TF Bo@@ ys .
was preparing for the national college entrance examination , one of his fans even burnt the midnight oil outlining review materials for him .
once during a concert in Chengdu , Kar@@ ry Wang &apos;s agent let him wear very thin clothing .
that broke his fans &apos; heart .
they s@@ warmed to the agent &apos;s S@@ ina Wei@@ bo page and poured their criticism on it .
meanwhile , they spontaneously sent clothes and other gifts to Kar@@ ry Wang , and proposed several regulations for the agent to obey .
another well @-@ know idol that started out as a teenager is Lu Han .
he has been losing fans ever since he announced his new relationship .
so you can see that today , fans &apos; power can even perme@@ ate into the most private part of their idol &apos;s life .
so much so that they want to intervene in all those private activities such as their parenting , marriage , relationship with someone or going to university .
it is no longer a relationship between fans and their idols in the traditional sense .
that &apos;s the first reversal of fans &apos; power@@ lessness .
and there is a second reversal , too .
only that the second reversal refers to the reversed relationship between fans and the media .
personally I think the media &apos;s opinion about fan culture has experienced several different stages .
in the very beginning , actually , the mainstream media .
especially the traditional media , surveyed fans and fan culture with doub@@ ting or maj@@ or@@ ly criticizing eyes .
however , I don &apos;t know if you have noticed that is being changed by degrees .
in the past , fans were considered as the end@@ point of consumption .
their power was limited to buying a movie ticket or an album of music .
now things have changed .
during the earliest part of production , including the planning and manufacturing , the power of fans have already been taken into account .
I &apos;ll give you two examples .
the first example is about the serious TV drama &quot; N@@ ir@@ v@@ ana in Fire , &quot; which used to be tren@@ ding in China , and its sequ@@ el , &quot; N@@ ir@@ v@@ ana in Fire II , &quot; rolled out last year .
there is something very interesting about it .
when this drama came out , it won a lot of praise and got the best ratings .
actually the promotional campaigns of the drama were also largely backed by its huge fan club and were conducted from the perspective of its fans .
another interesting TV drama I want to talk about here is &quot; Scar@@ let Heart . &quot;
it &apos;s also a very popular and successful TV drama that is them@@ ed on the royal life of the Qing Dynasty .
it was adapted from a popular network novel .
which later became a successful IP that could bring attention and creative ideas .
while preparing for the adaptation , the producers posted a poll asking the fans of the novel for their opinions about the choice of actors and act@@ resses for the drama .
it is a successful example of how TV dramas can pick actors and act@@ resses by involving fans in the process .
there is also a counter example .
Xu Lei , the author of &quot; The Lost Tom@@ b , &quot; a Chinese web series , encountered a backlash from his fans .
for he had dis@@ regarded their intention and sold the IP to several TV drama adap@@ tations that they disagreed with .
the battle between Xu Lei and his fans indicates that fans begin to think they are the co @-@ author of the work .
that &apos;s a huge change in concept .
now we &apos;ll come to the third reversal of fans &apos; power@@ lessness .
it refers to the reversed relationship between fans and capital .
nowadays we have a lot of IP@@ s , and among them network literature is the largest source of popular culture and modern creativity .
though several seminars about it have been held this year .
network literature still has a long way to go , for currently not all IP@@ s are lead IP@@ s .
lead IP@@ s mean those IP@@ s that can spark the interest of investors and catch the attention of the large platforms .
they can fall into two categories .
firstly , the classic IP@@ s , such as &quot; Jour@@ ney to the West , &quot; and Zhou Xing@@ chi &apos;s modern version of it , the film &quot; A Chinese O@@ dys@@ sey . &quot;
which inspired a lot of other movies linking to it in some sense , Ob@@ viously &quot; Jour@@ ney to the West &quot; is an enduring IP .
the second kind of lead IP depends on the hits it can get .
all kinds of promotional tactics , generally backed by fans , have to be employed here .
such as becoming a hot topic in S@@ ina Wei@@ bo or Dou@@ ban , increasing the Baidu SE@@ O ranking .
or am@@ assing more than 100 million points on network literature websites such as q@@ idi@@ an@@ .com and j@@ j@@ w@@ x@@ c.@@ net .
fans &apos; power can be felt in what the digital media presents to us .
so much has been said about how the powerless state of fans has been reversed .
we &apos;ve seen fans adopt several approaches to announce their power .
such as playing an active role in consumption and cultural reproduction , and making their voices heard .
all that leads us further to an important question .
what makes fans so enthusiastic ?
based on current study on fans , I think hormone plays a crucial part here .
most fans are teenagers , or females .
it looks as if the marginal , neglected population of our society are seeking through the fan culture for a collective power and right to speak .
in my opinion , the manic fan culture is also a product of the society whose bonds are loos@@ ening or disappearing .
as the society develops , people are more and more alien@@ ated from each other .
the age is forever gone when everyone knows about the details of his colleague &apos;s life .
the foreign countries are seeing their communities and churches fading away .
while in China , cultural bonds within a clan or a workplace are van@@ ishing .
fan culture then becomes a new alternative that is necessary for the atom@@ ized society .
in such a lonely society , we are not bonded by blood ties but by a common interest .
we project our love on the same person , and that person in turn brings us together .
we feel like we are the same type of person .
we can hud@@ dle together for warmth , as if the fan club is our haven .
here is another interesting question for you .
why do we need to understand the fan culture ?
people often ask me why , not so young any more .
a middle @-@ aged woman , I am interested in fan culture .
here I want to answer the question by quot@@ ing the famous words of Raymond Williams , a cultural scholar .
culture is not only found in the elite things .
it &apos;s also in every moment of our ordinary life .
in that case we will realize that everything we are experiencing - all the products of the mass culture - will one day con@@ geal into our collective memory and emotions .
a few days ago Jin Yong left us . I found my friends were instantly divided into two groups .
those who had read his works , and those who hadn &apos;t .
Jin Yong &apos;s novels belong to the mass culture , but they also mark a wall erected between people .
there are also other similar walls , such as &quot; Dream of the Red Chamber &quot; and &quot; Rom@@ ance of the Western Chamber . &quot;
so , if we put prejudice aside , we can say that fan culture is actually a most important daily culture for modern youths in China and abroad .
if we agree that young people should , in this age , or in any other age , be heard .
then we can &apos;t just dismiss the fan culture , for it provides an entrance to the inner world of the young generation .
with such an entrance , we can then understand the cultural logic of those lively , young minds and also the expression differences between different generations .
last but not least , never underestimate the youths and their power .
today &apos;s fan culture might turn out to be tomorrow &apos;s classic culture .
that &apos;s all for my speech today !
thank you !
hello everyone .
I &apos;m Liu M@@ eng@@ fei .
my topic today is &quot; Hom@@ o L@@ ud@@ ens , why do we need games ? &quot;
as for the meaning of &quot; Hom@@ o L@@ ud@@ ens . &quot;
I &apos;d like to keep you in suspense until later .
let &apos;s start from a recent highly @-@ popular movie , Re@@ ady Player One .
I believe most of you have watched it .
many game players thought that the movie presented their exact wish for an ideal future combining games and society .
however , as a game researcher and a gam@@ ification designer , I think otherwise .
let &apos;s review it in detail .
in the movie , the protagon@@ ist , a player himself , works hard with his partners to overcome all kinds of difficulties .
and by completing the missions in the virtual game released by the designer , they can save the real world .
the narrative is quite heroic .
but if we observe this scene of the movie , as you can see on the screen .
we find that the actual circumstance of the game is wretched .
it highlights a stark contrast between a wonderful virtual world and a gloomy reality .
which makes me unsure of it being the best combination of games and reality .
another thing wor@@ ths noticing is that the player &apos;s eyes are covered by a screen that cuts off his connection with the reality and con@@ fines him in the virtual world .
so I wonder if it &apos;s the ideal future .
judging from the social environment , it is obvious that the place where the protagon@@ ist lives is a sl@@ um district .
the world in Re@@ ady Player One is , so to speak , a vicious world with a severe disparity between the rich and the poor .
and we can see that the assembly line of big companies .
the capitalism and the industrial society are actually ruling the world .
in the ide@@ alized narrative of the movie , game players eventually defeated the streamlined system .
nevertheless , are we really able to do that in the reality ?
and , if the game @-@ combined reality in the future is like that , can we avoid it ?
as far as I &apos;m concerned , it &apos;s evident that a world in which wonderful things are becoming increasingly virtual , as the movie presents .
is not an ideal future where games are combined with the reality .
well , let &apos;s see another fascinating example .
this is an episode of Black Mir@@ ror , which depicts another kind of gam@@ ified future .
you wake up in a cramped little space to find that you are surrounded by various V@@ R screens .
and under the guidance of those screens and the game rules .
you exercise every day and the kinetic energy generated will transform into your productivity .
it seems that people are always playing in the world .
there the boundary between the virtual world and the reality will gradually blur .
and little by little , you will be rendered incapable of distinguishing what the real social contact is like .
just like the left @-@ bottom picture .
when all the commend@@ ation and support the player receives are all from the screens , real humans will be meaningless to him .
apparently , a life controlled by screens is also not what I wish for the future combination of games and reality .
if we put the two examples together .
we can find that each of them presents a highly digit@@ alized world .
in such as world , humans are , in academic terms , atom@@ ized .
what does that mean ?
an atom@@ ized person no longer exists as an individual or expresses himself freely .
he will be deprived of basic human rights and become a code , a symbol , or a tiny screw in the entire consumer society in which individuality is the least important .
and this can be proved in the last scene of the movie where people wear the same uniform and are stripped of personality .
I feel it &apos;s not only a bad future , but simply the same dreadful future as that in 1984 .
I started with such a depressing topic only because our reality is prone to develop toward that direction .
it &apos;s based on the anticipation of economists that in less than 20 years being hired to play games will be a major source of income for unemployed low @-@ skilled workers in the wave of automation .
the two examples are actually negative combinations of games and reality .
for me , they remind us of three things , and the first is the soci@@ ality of games .
this has long been neglected .
the second is the spirit@@ uality of games .
we have overlooked that games actually have bigger and better influences on society .
by the way , I &apos;d like to give a brief introduction of myself .
first of all , I &apos;m a game player .
I often attach three tags to me when talking about myself .
the tag of six means I have been a player since 6 years old .
I &apos;ve played , perhaps , more than 300 games on all kinds of platforms .
including console games , hand@@ held games , motion sensing games and only a few mobile games .
and the 11 years below means that I &apos;ve done roughly 11 years of game studies .
meanwhile , I conducted researches on plenty of games and gained a diverse range of results .
and the 5 years means that I , as a gam@@ ification designer , have led over 30 gam@@ ified projects of all sorts combining games and reality over the past 5 years .
I &apos;d like to know how many of you have heard or played these three games on the screen or the like .
please raise your hands .
well , I see a few .
these three games are the so @-@ called traditional console games which are endowed with an elaborate , complete narrative or system of rules for a deeper experience .
however , the majority of game players are never the players of such games , but those of the games on the next slide .
so , how many of you are playing , or have heard these games , or know that your friends are playing these games ?
please let me see your hands .
eh , a lot more .
these are the current popular games , and the games on the last slide are hard@@ core games .
but they are all games in nature .
although all the popular games like World of War@@ craft also have a complete narrative structure and world outlook .
they are more focused on battles between players .
their contents are formed by players , with more soci@@ ability than narr@@ ativity .
in fact , people around us probably play more and are more familiar with such games .
so when talking about games , we usually think of such games .
but the forms of games are actually much richer than that .
and , who have played these three games on the screen ?
hands up , please .
anyone who played , is playing or heard others playing them ?
the number is much smaller .
well , the left one is a motion sensing game in which you move your body to dance and follow the rules .
and at the right top is P@@ ok@@ em@@ on Go , in which you may explore in the real world through the guidance on the screen .
and at the right bottom is N@@ inten@@ dogs , a hand@@ held game in which you can have virtual pets to keep your company .
so what are the common features of the three games ?
they are all closely related to the real world .
when playing them , you go bey@@ ong@@ d the control of game screen and are involved in deeper interactions with the reality .
these are also games .
players are the controllers of them .
but generally we may not realize this aspect of games .
as for the following games , no need to ask .
I believe every one of you must have played chess and card , ma@@ h@@ j@@ ong and board games of all sorts .
these traditional games played in the real world are of course also games .
they are more social , but are also games .
apart from entertainment , they also carry a lot functions we often lose sight of in the concept of games such as information exchange and social communication .
yes , few have ever noticed .
this slide shows six classic Chinese arts , including skills like poetry , calligraphy , rites , music , Gu@@ q@@ in , chess and painting .
when you think closely , these are all games .
they are also games , and only more elegant ones .
this shows that games , as a very basic structure , can carry a lot of content , and can actually generate more creative results .
but , whenever we talk about games .
we fail to realize it , which limits our use of them .
as a matter of fact , the original structure of some more important foundations of human society is actually games .
for example , law , music , poetry , art and so on .
I put a picture on this slide to remind you that places like court are also playing fields .
we often say that a game has its magical circle .
it &apos;s a sacred place enclosed in a specific time and space .
and the circle of court , obviously has its , if not players , participants challenging each other on the basis of fixed rules and regulations .
and the results depend on how much they have dedicated to this system .
so that &apos;s actually also a kind of game .
in this sense , all of us are already a player as long as we are in the existing social structure .
whether we play video games or not .
the last ones are not so elegant , but are integrated into the life of every one .
I believe you must use We@@ Run , We@@ Chat Read and other apps that can encourage you to make your life better and more joyful through gam@@ ified ways .
these Ap@@ ps have actually blended in with our life .
and there are also some stimulating us to conduct practices such as collectively breaking down protein structure .
these are very common now .
but they are also games .
on such a basis , we will find something of great importance that all of us are basically players .
and we ourselves are &quot; Hom@@ o L@@ ud@@ ens , &quot; the term I mentioned at the beginning .
humans , as a species , formed everything in our society in games .
so we will continue on this path .
in this way , the right to play is actually a part of basic human rights .
we just tend to look down on it in general and ignore its potential .
but today , we should no longer ignore its potential .
Games have already been the most recent , most influential and most im@@ measurable medium in the modern society .
we can &apos;t allow it to develop like this anymore .
I &apos;ve talked a lot .
overall , games should have a definition , which is a set of meaning systems guided by rules , based on players &apos; initiative and conducted in a specific time and space .
the key point of this definition lies in &quot; meaning systems . &quot;
but when people think of games , they usually focus on entertainment , with rare attention paid to the meaning .
I carried out a research before to gather all the definitions of games on a page .
you can see it on this slide , the one with plenty of words .
then I made an analysis on word frequency and extracted key words from it .
on this page , words with higher frequency are increased in their font size .
so , what are the key elements of a real game ?
they are initiative , rules and humans .
after all , I believe that video games themselves are media for humans .
it was endowed with equality and freedom .
equality means that you can get rid of your social status in the real world and enter the game .
and how much you achieve depends on how much you have dedicated to it .
meanwhile , freedom means that although there is a set of rules .
under such rules , you will always have the freedom to play your own role and the freedom to choose the direction to develop .
the reason why I denied the situation in Re@@ ady Player One as an ideal future is that it &apos;s freedom and equality are not extended to the outside world .
through the gam@@ ified examples and other examples , we know that the origin of games is human .
in that case , it is natural that games can influence everything of us , and thus games should not be limited in screens .
some of the above @-@ mentioned interpretations of games may be unfamiliar to us Chinese .
since we have long been accustomed to the use of some limited words when referring to games .
I once looked into the opinions on games in Twenty @-@ Four Hist@@ ories .
who were playing games ?
what kind of social evaluation did these people get ?
and what happened to them at last ?
and the results I obtained , as you can see on the screen .
is that game players are people who are obviously not gentleman @-@ like , such as monarch , sy@@ cop@@ han@@ tic minister , servant , concub@@ ine , slave , etc .
in Chinese culture , when analyzing the morph@@ em@@ es of words about games such as &quot; xi &quot; and &quot; xi &quot; ( both mean &quot; play &quot; ) .
you will find , for example , the radical component of &quot; N@@ VE &quot; ( female ) means that &quot; xi &quot; does not belong to the mainstream society .
besides , the character &quot; xi , &quot; in or@@ acle bone script , is in the form of a person holding a sacred weapon and dancing to Chinese drum .
there is something cruel and abnormal to dist@@ ain serious things .
our contempt for games is in our genes from the beginning .
but I have to point out that this is an attitude specific to the Confucian school .
the Tao@@ ist attitude and the Buddhist attitude are actually very different .
we don &apos;t have enough time to go deeper into this .
but the key point is that our bi@@ ases against games often obscure our understanding of games .
whenever we use the word &quot; game &quot; in Chinese .
we use it in a cultural context where excessive attention to play@@ thing s@@ aps the will .
that &apos;s why we have the concept of internet addiction .
in fact , it does not necessarily hold true in theory , but everyone emb@@ races it very openly and feels that it does not need to be demonstrated .
just because it &apos;s in line with our cultural bias .
such a bias certainly hin@@ ders our understanding and use of games .
however , in some other countries , people have long regarded games as a kind of cultural heritage and also a kind of electronic heritage .
and relevant work includes archives , that is , to carry out protection of past games , and researches on various characteristics of games .
besides , one of the most important parts is to apply games to education and popularization of science so that the public can make wider use of our new electronic heritage .
on this basis , I &apos;d like to share with you my recent research .
I think we should actually put forward a new concept .
when we study games as a history of games and as a special kind of knowledge .
we can actually bring the potential of games as cultural and electronic heritage into full play more widely .
and I &apos;d like to mention three examples .
when we look at games on the basis of a deeper understanding .
we will find it natural to have games on this slide .
at the left corner is a game made by a pair of parents whose child died of cancer .
through the game , they recorded the whole process of their children &apos;s struggle against cancer .
as they said , &quot; We were deeply grieved at the loss of our child , but later we realized if we recorded the process of his struggle against cancer .
we would seize the most essential spirit of him , and he will be with us forever in this way . &quot;
what we can see from this is that the game not only serves as a sol@@ ace .
but can also extend such an emotion to a bigger group of people .
not every one of us suffers from cancer , but when we have the first @-@ hand experience of cancer in the game .
we will develop a new understanding of life and death .
and such an experience can &apos;t be gained in other media at all .
the other two games on this slide are domestic games .
one is TS@@ G@@ AM@@ E .
it &apos;s an old game of the 9@@ 0s , and the San@@ lian Book@@ store also participated in its release .
the game was quite interesting .
we used to have a lot excellent game heritage that carried rich cultural contents . we just forgot them .
TS@@ G@@ AM@@ E is made on the basis of Ever@@ lasting Re@@ gre@@ t .
in the game , you move forward by composing poetry and solving ancient rid@@ dles .
during the process , your cultural taste will be refined .
unlike some mechanical games , its entire experience is quite graceful .
it is a traditional game that has the style of wash painting .
well , the right one is a down@@ right commercial game , Mar@@ tial Arts Her@@ oes .
in the game you may experience Gu@@ q@@ in , chess , calligraphy and painting .
the screen@@ shot I put here is a picture of ac@@ u@@ point .
to complete the challenge , you must memorize the plan of ac@@ u@@ points .
such games will expose people who won &apos;t voluntarily read traditional Chinese classics to the most dynamic part of our traditional culture .
and they will gain a first @-@ hand experience , which , as we know , is essential to the recognition of those classics .
now that I have mentioned industrial society and video games , I also want to share with you a fascinating research of mine .
previously , I &apos;ve made a comparison between the daily life contents of primitive humans in the age of hunting and gathering and the core contents of World of War@@ craft .
I found there were corresponding relations .
I would like to ask you to guess , in the age of hunting and gathering .
how long will they work every day to meet their survival needs ?
some say 4 hours , not right .
Oh , 2 hours , who said that , it &apos;s correct .
according to the researches of anthropol@@ o@@ gists , 2 hours would suffice for them .
so , during other time , they soci@@ alized , advent@@ ured and conducted game @-@ like behaviors in the real life .
and we know that in W@@ O@@ W , we actually do the things that our ancestors did in the age of hunting and gathering .
it &apos;s rather natural , for our biological basis has never changed , and it &apos;s our society and culture that are changing too fast .
the industrial society in which we are all involved is a highly mechan@@ ized , profession@@ alized and streamlined society .
every one of us is a screw of the society of machine and only focuses on our own responsibilities .
and the influences can only be revealed at the next link .
however , you couldn &apos;t see the influences .
the entire society runs with a high efficiency , but the meaning of a single individual is relatively weak .
nevertheless , our biological basis as a hunter @-@ ga@@ there@@ r makes us accustomed to the sight of the direct influences of our behaviors .
in that case , video games are actually a most effective approach to make up for the obstruc@@ ted and elong@@ ated meaning chain .
whatever games we play , we are to pursue the meaning , instead of simple entertainment or an outlet of our compul@@ sive emotions .
we &apos;re looking for our significance .
only by influencing others and the circumstances can we know that we are instrumental to the society and to human being .
it &apos;s such a mentality that prop@@ els us to persevere in games .
in other words , when playing video games .
we are actually the hunter @-@ ga@@ there@@ rs in machine , and we chase after a natural ut@@ opia .
Games can bring us a better future .
the current game studies actually have discovered something , but we seldom realize it .
game studies , as a specialized field , has developed for 20 years .
and has its associations , journals , and many achievements by overseas scholars .
we simply don &apos;t know them .
it has been proved that games have a positive effect on such respects as brain development and frustration resistance .
besides , games &apos; social effects of all sorts should not be neglected .
moreover , if we predict the future of games .
I believe it must be to break out from screens and the magical circle .
and the games in the future may increasingly resemble P@@ ok@@ em@@ on Go , integrating reality into them .
then , we may be able to guide our actions in reality more through the rules of games .
and make more changes and progress in applying games to education , in off @-@ line experience , in medical gam@@ ification and in parent @-@ child relationship .
the above @-@ mentioned actually have come into being since a long time ago , and are happening now .
however , during the process of gam@@ ification , there are some hidden risks when we integrate games with society .
for example , I have some short videos here .
sometimes , due to the need of clearing stages in games , we may actively choose an un@@ free state .
as shown on the screen , in an AR world , you may have a gam@@ ified experience , like learning how to cook and how to date .
however , under such circumstances , at last , how you know the person you meet will no longer be important .
what really matters will be how to win the game .
so , we actively choose an un@@ free state .
this is worrying .
in addition , to the right is another example , one episode of Black Mir@@ ror , in which people grade each other on social impression .
in this world , the players with higher scores form a monopoly .
enjoying their fixed social benefits that players with lower scores can &apos;t have .
it &apos;s another consolidation of hierarchical system that we need to pay attention to .
so , what is the ideal future of games ?
I can &apos;t give you an exact answer , but if you tilt your head to see this picture .
you will notice that the future of games still depends on humans .
all kinds of humans , in@@ dom@@ itable ones , moving ones , standing ones ... We ourselves are &quot; Hom@@ o L@@ ud@@ ens . &quot;
Games have guided our past life and will certainly guide our future life .
however , what destination they will reach , whether they will become a free and equal medium , and whether they will help us become in@@ dom@@ itable depend on every one of us .
thank you !
hello , everyone .
I &apos;m Lin P@@ in , an observer as well as a follow@@ er of the AC@@ G ( An@@ ime , Com@@ ic and Games ) culture .
I believe everybody here have heard more or less about the concept of AC@@ G culture .
however , not everybody knows the ori@@ gion of AC@@ G culture or the reason why it is prevalent .
if we trace back , we would find out that the term actually came from Japanese .
it was originally a geometric term that referred to two @-@ dimensional space and world in the Japanese .
the bu@@ zz@@ word AC@@ G or the two @-@ dimensional space that we are gonna discuss today did not form its meaning and usage until the mid @-@ 1990s .
in my view , &quot; the root of all evil &quot; can be traced back to the debut of the animation Mar@@ tian Suc@@ c@@ essor Nad@@ es@@ ic@@ o in 1996 .
this is a science @-@ fiction anim@@ e that sets the context at the end of the 2@@ 2nd century .
it depicts a group of particularly interesting characters .
they are descendants of human migrants that was exiled to the Jupiter by the civilization on earth in the 21st century , which is ages ago according to the plot .
before they were exiled to Jupiter , their ancestors carried along with them an anim@@ e called Ge@@ k@@ ig@@ anger III .
over time , the book Ge@@ k@@ ig@@ anger III became a special existence for the civilization on Jupiter .
because not only the people on Jupiter warship the book of Ge@@ k@@ ig@@ anger III and take the spirits of it as their life mo@@ to .
they are also crazy about the heroin , Nan@@ ako , and regard her as their goddess .
however , people on Jupiter could never achieve their dream of meeting Nan@@ ako , why is that ?
because they are people in two separate worlds just like us standing outside the screen and the people on Jupiter who are inside the screen .
in the ain@@ ime , the people on Jupiter are the audience and Nan@@ ako is the character of the show , they are located in two completely separate worlds .
you may have noticed that the limitation is insur@@ moun@@ table physically and physi@@ ologically as such .
in face of such situation , the people on Jupiter find themselves in complete hop@@ elessness and could only console each other by saying that .
&quot; Nan@@ ako is perfect , but nevertheless she is in the two @-@ dimensional world . &quot;
I wonder if you could relate to this line .
but for me , I was deeply touched when I first read it .
it also echoed with many Japanese anim@@ e and game lovers called &quot; O@@ tak@@ u &quot; when later presented in Japan .
now think about it , we may all have fallen in love deeply with some anim@@ e , cartoon and game characters .
however , it &apos;s never possible for us to make physical contact or physiological connection with these characters .
Bec@@ as@@ use these characters that we love so much exist only in a virtual world consists of two @-@ dimensional lines , planar images and motion pictures .
the line is so enligh@@ tening and the concept of AC@@ G culture it conve@@ ys showed us the dimensional difference between two group of people clearly and precisely , which highlights the character of it as an intermediary .
since the mid @-@ 1990s , an increasing number of game enthusi@@ asts began to use the abbrevi@@ ation of AC@@ G culture to refer the two @-@ dimensional virtual world created with anim@@ e , cartoon and games .
here I &apos;d like to point out that , when people on Jupiter and anim@@ e and game lovers adopt the concept of AC@@ G , they seem to differentiate it from the three @-@ dimensional concept .
that is , they tend to separate the virtual 2@@ D world from the 3D real world in which real people live .
at first sight , this seem to form a contrast between the reality and virtual world .
but when you think closely of the context of the sentence uttered by the person on Jupiter .
he actually expressed earnestly his genuine and strong affection towards the 2@@ D world and characters .
it is this affection that ar@@ ouses the dedicated longing for actual contact with Nan@@ ako .
as well as the pious practice of the Ge@@ k@@ ig@@ anger spirits in life .
according to my observation and personal experience of AC@@ G culture .
it is easy to notice that many anim@@ e and game lovers could get sincere emotional experience from the 2@@ D world in a sense of psychological real@@ ti@@ y rather than the physical reality .
moreover , compared with the 3D society requiring certain masks to comply in appearance .
their emotional commitment to the 2@@ D world may be more sincere and intense .
thus , we cannot judge or differentiate the relationship between true and false , real and virtual in a logical frame for binary opposition .
perhaps the question that is worth asking is that .
why do so many people commit so sincerely and strongly to the object referred to as the virtual world and characters ?
here I &apos;d like to introduce an academic and theoretical term to support the explanation and interpretation of such a socio @-@ cultural trend .
during my undergraduate studies , there was once an experienced predecessor or senior who enlightened me by saying that post @-@ modernity was like a basket that could accommodate everything .
here I &apos;d like to first share with you the theoretical concept of post @-@ modernity which usually leads to intense discussion .
the application of it varies from person to person , and different people may fill in distinct theoretical conno@@ tations .
then in what specific sense am I sharing the concept of post @-@ modernity with you ?
well , I borrow the usage from a Japanese expert in ot@@ ak@@ u culture , named Hiro@@ ki Az@@ uma , who is the fat guy behind me on the right .
or the concept of Ly@@ ot@@ ard , a French post @-@ modern@@ ist and philosopher that Hiro@@ ki Az@@ uma quoted .
according to them , the status of post @-@ modernity first implies the decline of grand narr@@ atives .
what is grand narrative then ?
here it refers to a series of systems of concepts that modern political communities base on to unite their members since the Enligh@@ tenment .
it provides an authoritative interpretation for the rules of social functions .
transc@@ end@@ ental value and significance for human activities , as well as a coherent narrative for the development process of our history .
during the historical changes of the 20th century .
however , certain grand narr@@ atives supporting the modern civilization are gradually deprived of their authority and appeal .
while during the turbulent years from the outbreak of the World War I to the end of the Cold War , tragic and traumatic historical events one after another almost destroy the tower of faith in humanism , enlightenment and reason , as well as the notion of historical progress .
the update of liberal capitalism and modern science and technology disp@@ els the social foundation of some grand narr@@ atives to a great extent and renders the whole society highly mobile and scattered .
as the modern grand narrative collapses in the context of post @-@ modern , as the new generation growing from its ruins .
we are facing a vacuum field of cultural value .
as like those people on Jupiter in Mar@@ tian Suc@@ c@@ essor Nad@@ es@@ ic@@ o , their spiritual connection with the civilization on earth is cut off when they were ban@@ ished to Jupiter .
for us , the new generation who is involved and evolve in the context of post @-@ modernity , it &apos;s also difficult to connect our inner world to the grand narrative which the modern civilization once tried to construct in a rational , smooth and convincing way .
it is in such a context that the AC@@ G culture plays an important role and exer@@ ts great mental influence on us .
in the AC@@ G culture , a great many of excellent 2@@ D works would provide a grand system for world view setting while narr@@ ating a intriguing story , in the same way as Ge@@ k@@ ig@@ anger III did to fill the vacuum of spirit , culture and value for those Jupiter people .
these world view systems accommodate people in ruins of grand narr@@ atives in a distinct and characteristic manner with grand narrative alternatives , also referred to as 2@@ D grand narr@@ atives .
the AC@@ G enthusi@@ asts , without doubt , are diverse in constitution as well as in form , whereas from my personal experience .
the most attractive part of the AC@@ G is no other than the compens@@ ating mental effects realized by these two @-@ dimensional grand narr@@ atives .
in my childhood , I used to buy Dragon Ball or Yu@@ Yu Hak@@ ush@@ o that sel@@ led for 0.5 yuan each .
later I watched Nar@@ u@@ to and Dig@@ im@@ on on the television and desktop .
in my youth , I liked to watch F@@ ate and Mad@@ ok@@ a Mag@@ ica on my tablet , laptop and smart@@ phone .
these AC@@ G works I love and indulge in deeply always break the boundaries between tradition and modernity , the east and the west , the mund@@ ane and mysterious , as well as science and magic .
which bl@@ ends a variety of elements into a grand system that builds people &apos;s world view .
thanks to the AC@@ G culture , technology is no longer dull and cold , and seems to become dynamic and magical .
at the same time , magic doesn &apos;t make up ev@@ ocation of pre @-@ modern spirits , and instead , it becomes an en@@ chanting source of wonders by means of emergent media .
such setting of world views enables us to be immersed in such characters as we &apos;ll probably identify with them and imagine that we possess supernatural power .
we would have magical experience in a magnificent and witty space .
moreover , new intermediaries like the anim@@ e and games would make these wonderful experiences more drastic and impressive .
as such , they constitute a pleasure reactor , one with strong power offering the cartoon readers , animation audience and game players ceas@@ eless pleasure .
what &apos;s more to me is that these fantastic encounters under the 2@@ D world view setting are usually endowed with significance linking the fate of a community and even the world as the story un@@ folds .
meanwhile , characters are placed under relatively extreme circumstances to set off the emotional energy contained in the bond among characters .
the bond here is a two @-@ dimensional term representing the strong and profound emotional connection between people .
for me , there &apos;s a narrative pattern that is quite common yet always feasible .
as worldwide crisis keeps escalating , bonds among characters are constantly threatened and tested with issues of life and death .
to sustain the fragile and necessary bond under extreme circumstances among the characters that we identify with .
the causal links must be transformed to a potential activating key to release energy of the inner universe , so as to save the external universe and defend the bond simultaneously .
why can such a narrative pattern hit me repeatedly ?
as far as I can see , the potential emotional intensity of such a bond will be extremely difficult for post @-@ modern 2@@ D enthusi@@ asts to experience in the mediocre and mechanically repeating 3D life , provided that audio @-@ visual media can successfully create a sense of immer@@ sion and the animation audience , cartoon readers and game players can be sincerely immersed in it .
furthermore , the world view setting and the plots design of 2@@ D works can thus render the transc@@ ending value and expression long lost for me at least temporarily self @-@ justified within the story framework and structure of feeling .
when I see Sun Wu@@ kong , here I &apos;d like to call him K@@ ak@@ ar@@ ot@@ to based on the principle of &quot; drama is not nonsense .
and adaptation is not made up &quot; -- when I see K@@ ak@@ ar@@ ot@@ to transcend his own limits continuously to defend his important partners and the Earth .
when I see Nar@@ u@@ to Uz@@ um@@ aki ceas@@ elessly stand sufferings and tests hard to imagine for ordinary people to realize a world of great harmony where people understand each other .
when I see the King of K@@ nights , Sab@@ er , wi@@ eld the sword Ex@@ cali@@ bu@@ r and destroy the evil Holy Gr@@ ail at the price of his own life and say farewell to his love of life .
when I see Mad@@ ok@@ a Kan@@ ame sacrifice his own life and traces of existence to reverse the caus@@ ation of the whole universe and bring final hope to each and every magical girl dying in despair .
the excitement and sacred feeling I feel is impossible to experience in the three @-@ dimensional society perv@@ aded by the atmosphere of ni@@ hil@@ ism , cy@@ nic@@ ism , refined ego@@ ism and extreme individualism .
for me , the 2@@ D grand narrative in this sense may have a spiritual compensation effect on many 2@@ D enthusi@@ asts .
we often hear severe criticism from seniors towards the AC@@ G culture followers .
criticism like , &quot; You are escaping from reality . &quot;
or , &quot; You &apos;re addicted to the virtual world . &quot;
in my opinion , or when we observe and comprehend from another perspective .
however , if modern grand narr@@ atives no longer have the meaning and value of truth for us .
if we are inevitably situated in ruins of reality .
can we take the enthusiasm for AC@@ G as a compens@@ ating spiritual pursuit as well ?
or rather , as an immer@@ sive experience of a hyper@@ real world more real than the reality ?
many friends here may think that the person is such a chu@@ uni@@ by@@ o for my previous utter@@ ance , especially the four examples above .
well , as an experienced and well @-@ informed 2@@ D enthusi@@ ast .
I &apos;m often identified , recognized or te@@ ased as &quot; a chu@@ uni@@ by@@ o patient &quot; by three @-@ dimensional friends .
but you &apos;re assured that a chu@@ uni@@ by@@ o suffe@@ rer as me is in fact only one type of the 2@@ D enthusi@@ asts in all kinds of AC@@ G culture followers , I am perhaps an old @-@ fashioned one .
what I &apos;m gonna talk now may arouse more concern for many three @-@ dimensional people .
because we can observe that since the 1990s , and not just in the post @-@ cold war era , a cy@@ nic mood has spread across the globe .
and in the specific social context of Japan , ordinary Japanese even ran up against the burst of bubble economy and secular stagnation , known to history as &quot; He@@ is@@ ei Depression . &quot;
young people growing from this period of depression are inevitably lost in the grave ni@@ h@@ ility and a strong sense of power@@ lessness in face of the reality of consolidated social hierarchy and the fate of impossible interactions between individual struggle and the formation of history .
and furthermore , the lost and decad@@ ent young people , like the protagon@@ ist Sh@@ inj@@ i I@@ k@@ ari in the Ne@@ on Gen@@ esis Ev@@ ang@@ eli@@ on , live in a post @-@ industrial consumer society .
they are well exposed to highly advanced cultural and creative industries that produce in a massive and differentiated manner all kinds of cultural products , thus get some pleasure and consolation from them .
in such a background , a lot of &quot; ot@@ ak@@ u &quot; or self @-@ te@@ asing &quot; He@@ is@@ ei disp@@ ir@@ ited ot@@ ak@@ u &quot; appeared .
in words of Hiro@@ ki Az@@ uma , this is a generation emerging from the condition of more thorough post modernity that does not require grand narr@@ atives at all .
so here comes the question , which brand has the best excav@@ ating technology ?
zone 11 ner@@ v I@@ k@@ ari G@@ end@@ ou !
Eva excav@@ ator , you deserve it .
sorry , truly sorry , my chu@@ uni@@ by@@ o breaks out again .
that was not my actual question .
my real question is what drives these ot@@ ak@@ u in consuming the AC@@ G if they don &apos;t need two @-@ dimensional grand narrative ?
according to Hiro@@ ki Az@@ uma , it &apos;s neither the superficial story , nor the underlying world view setting that truly drives the cultural consumption , rather .
it &apos;s the 2@@ D characters that are present in the story and able to be extracted from the story context at the same time .
it is the database of &quot; cute Mo E &quot; ( ad@@ orable elements ) that keeps updating and producing these characters .
before explaining the new concept of database of cute Mo E , it &apos;s necessary to review a very important business mode of the 2@@ D industry .
that is , IP operation , you &apos;ve probably all heard about it , or it is often referred as Medi@@ a@@ Mi@@ x planning in Japan .
for example , after the cartoon At@@ tack on T@@ itan gained high popularity .
animation and games adapted from it and a series of peripheral derivatives were quickly launched .
after the cartoon Ne@@ on Gen@@ esis Ev@@ ang@@ eli@@ on became popular .
animation and games adapted from it and a series of peripheral derivatives were quickly produced .
same with the cartoon Ste@@ ins ; Gate .
after it went viral , there were a ser@@ ie of cartoon and game adap@@ tations of it as well as deri@@ vi@@ atives .
the AC@@ G culture could not only generate products of multiple intermediaries , but also develop product lines based one multiple media vehicles .
followers of the culture could also reuse the existing works as a material library and produce new contents themselves .
for instance , fic@@ tions , cartoons , videos , radio plays , games , cos@@ play , peripheral products , handic@@ rafts and the like based on the characters or settings in AC@@ G works .
so here &apos;s the question , we can imagine that during the IP operation and the deriv@@ ation of &quot; Dou@@ j@@ in@@ shi , &quot; the plot actually develops continuously .
even the world view setting is not persistent , and instead , various parallel univers@@ es are derived or produced .
then what pushes the 2@@ D users to wander in the sea of contents constituted by both the IP product chains and the fan culture of dou@@ j@@ in@@ shi .
from the current situation , the most probable answer is not 2@@ D grand narr@@ atives on which chu@@ uni@@ by@@ o followers like me would be keen .
rather , it &apos;s the 2@@ D characters that attract 2@@ D users so much as Nan@@ ako is to the Jupiter people .
what I &apos;d like to emphasize here is that , these 2@@ D characters can actually surpass the context of stories and dis@@ engage from the world view setting for independent existence .
and thus , for pop products like Hat@@ s@@ une Mi@@ ku and Love Live .
design of only one or one group of 2@@ D characters as fictitious idols is enough to support a product chain involving multiple media vehicles .
then what is it that maintains a relative consist@@ enc@@ ey among different 2@@ D characters when they appear in different forms and keep switching from one universe from another set by different world views .
it is the special combination of a fixed and non @-@ narrative character profiles and the special characters .
or in words of Hiro@@ ki Az@@ uma , the combination of &quot; cute Mo E &quot; and certain characters .
&quot; cute Mo E &quot; here refers to the character setting elements that could ev@@ oke the affection of 2@@ D users .
in the highly sophisticated logic of the culture industry .
the character setting elements of those 2@@ D characters that gain users &apos; affection to a certain extent will be analyzed and concluded to a &quot; cute Mo E &quot; database available for expansion of the industry and reproduction .
the needs of both practitioners of the 2@@ D industry and cre@@ ators of the user @-@ generated contents could be met in the vast &quot; cute Mo E &quot; database .
moreover , various &quot; cute Mo E &quot; characters can be created through separation , re@@ combination and re@@ circulation of these elements .
this may be way too abstract , so let &apos;s look at an example .
behind me are there three 2@@ D cute Mo E characters who are relatively popular .
on my right and your left , is one of the hero@@ ins in the milestone animation Ne@@ on Gen@@ esis Ev@@ ang@@ eli@@ on that was first broadcast in 1995 .
A@@ su@@ ka , and she is a fierce girl with two pony tails , a classic character combined with cute Mo E elements .
when the character setting of a fierce girl with two pony tails is proved to be a quite popular cute Mo E element combination by the market , it is quickly and widely adopted in the 2@@ D industry .
but attention please , adoption does not mean repetition .
and instead , it means the creation of new cute Mo E characters during re@@ combination .
for instance , for one of the hero@@ ins in F@@ ate , R@@ in To@@ h@@ s@@ aka ( in the middle ) , and the important character Phy@@ ll@@ is me@@ ow me@@ ow in Ste@@ ins .
gate ( on your right ) , all these character show the attribute of a girl with a strong personality and two pony tails .
however , these new characters have some elements that A@@ su@@ ka does not have and these new combinations formed some new cute Mo E characters .
or we can look at Sun Shang@@ xiang in the Honor of Kings .
actually the character has nothing to with the Wu princess in the history .
with the name of a Wu princess , she has two pony tails , a strong personality , a classic combination of cute Mo E elements .
at the same time , the game designers also refer to some historical legends and pop culture to make Sun Shang@@ xiang as someone that masters bows and arrows .
and hence , she would definitely be an Ar@@ cher if she were in F@@ ate .
then with reference to such a setting , Sun Shang@@ xiang is added , assembled and combined with an attribute of being good at weapons by holding long @-@ range artillery in addition to a girl with two pony tails .
you may find that this combination can only be established within such a 2@@ D setting where the boundary between history evolution and science @-@ fiction and fantasy must be smashed .
then it can be found that , although many passionately devoted ot@@ ak@@ u would emphasize that the 2@@ D character they love and cherish is unique .
according to the logic of cultural industry , the pictorial symbols identified as the same character in the animation , cartoon , video game or in the peripheral , garage kit and cos@@ play .
are really nothing more than specific combinations of some cute Mo E elements extracted from the database .
and further implementation and presentation of such combinations in each specific world view setting , story context and media vehicle .
then how could the 2@@ D characters built with combinations of cute Mo E elements keep attracting the attention of those ot@@ ak@@ u ?
one possible explanation that I cannot accept without reserve is as follows .
each of us lives in a society of strangers transformed and shaped by highly mobile market @-@ oriented employment and large @-@ scale urbanization .
people in a society as such can be easily caught in a loneliness and alienation of atomic existence .
what &apos;s more , the decline of grand narr@@ atives aforementioned make a commensur@@ able and shar@@ able social ethics standard hard to establish .
which further intensi@@ fies such an atomic existence dilemma .
for these post @-@ modern subjects , both people in the interpersonal relationships and those in the system of social rules .
are actually hard to act as the basis to determine the answer for our mystery of desire , rather , they pose disturbing problems one after another .
under such circumstances and in a 2@@ D world .
the diverse and fixed 2@@ D characters provide with the ot@@ ak@@ u that lives in the digital world a convenient path to satisfy their lust and desires without the need for other medi@@ ums .
those cute Mo E elements that cultivate demands induc@@ tively and satisfy demands in a highly targeted manner can build closed and quick loops between deficiency and sufficiency in an in@@ exhaustible manner for 2@@ D users .
as such , these cute Mo E elements , and specific combinations thereof .
and the CP combinations between these elements can effectively serve as key words that are easy to search .
it induc@@ es 2@@ D users to call for content resources desirable from the big data ocean by means of various search engines .
also for this reason , they can effectively serve as discer@@ ni@@ ble objects of desires driving these 2@@ D enthusi@@ asts to acquire a relatively stable source of pleasure from changing ceas@@ elessly the story context and switching the world view setting according to their own interests .
such a phenomenon presents us with a socio @-@ cultural trend worthy of attention , and proposes some crucial problems worth exploring .
when the glamorous 2@@ D illusion satisfies the appeal of meaning and emotional needs of post @-@ modern subjects as an alternative .
is the grand narrative no longer necessary for the functioning of the human community ?
when captiv@@ ating characters assembled from character setting elements and digital videos occupy new media interfaces of the post @-@ modern consumer society , can we say that human are no longer necessary for intimate relationships ?
furthermore , as more and more IP operation projects and Medi@@ a@@ Mi@@ x plan@@ ings attempt to establish a whole industry chain connecting the animation and game with the film and television industries .
more and more popular products combine such digital animation generated by computers with video materials from location shooting .
which creates fascinating phan@@ tom and make people addicted .
more and more new technologies , such as the virtual reality technology and the augmented reality technology are commerci@@ alized on a large scale .
the boundary between the virtual and real is also increasingly bl@@ urry and ambiguous .
then another question is that , will the opposing concepts of 2@@ D and 3D that are built based on their differences become eventually out @-@ dated .
I &apos;ve got no definite answers for such interesting questions .
and I just want to trigger some thinking and discussion upon this topic , hoping to inspire more creative and in @-@ depth reflection and discussion .
that &apos;s all ! thank you for listening .
thank you !
good afternoon , everyone .
I &apos;m Chen Qi@@ u@@ fan .
our topic today may sound fut@@ uristic .
it &apos;s about the &quot; significance of science fiction novels &quot;
actually , this topic is rooted in a very realistic context .
about two months ago , Pan Shi@@ yi , a well @-@ known billionaire met his idol Liu ci@@ xin , who I guess is also the idol of many present here today , including myself .
he met Mr. Liu to take photos of him and also ask him a few questions .
as we know , with the Three Body Problem becoming a sensation , many Internet practitioners and investors have borrowed various useful concepts from the novel .
such as dimension reduction attack , the Dark Forest Theory and the Three Body management .
some entrepreneurs have gone so far as to invite Mr. Liu to be their counsel@@ lor .
hoping to draw on his &quot; magic power &quot; to dispel the mist in reality and catch a glimpse of the future .
like Mr. Liu introduced , he attended this year &apos;s World B@@ lock@@ chain Conference held in Wu@@ zhen .
many ty@@ co@@ ons present at the conference said that they could perceive block@@ chain thinking in the Three Body Problem .
but Mr. Liu denied , &quot; I completed that novel around 2006 .
when the idea of block@@ chain was no where to be seen . &quot;
that &apos;s the fact . then Pan Shi@@ yi asked Liu ci@@ xin many more questions concerning how science fiction novels could influence the real world .
Mr. Liu is a very down @-@ to @-@ earth man .
he said , &quot; I &apos;m just a science fiction writer .
to me , science fiction is created for its own sake and anything beyond this scope is not real science fiction . &quot;
as we see , there are two very different views in this regard .
some , like those entrepreneurs , regard a sci@@ ene @-@ fiction writer as a R@@ in@@ po@@ che who is capable of fortune @-@ telling .
others , like Mr. Liu , consider writing science fiction novels a hobby .
then what are the right attitudes respectively for science fiction readers and writers towards science fiction ?
what on earth is the significance of science fiction ?
this is precisely the topic that I want to share with you guys here on the stage of &quot; Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u . &quot;
there is a Chinese saying that goes &quot; The usefulness of the useless is in fact of great importance . &quot;
this saying perfectly concludes the significance of science fiction novels in my view .
it is one of the most important literary gen@@ res today .
this is not my word .
actually , it was said by a former guest of Z@@ ao@@ ji@@ u - Yu@@ val Noah Har@@ ari at an interview with the W@@ ired .
according to him , science fiction helps shape new ideas such as AI and bio @-@ technology in the mind of the general public .
those technologies will sub@@ vert our life and society within decades .
let &apos;s look back to the birth of science fiction in 18@@ 18 .
that was an age of change characterized by industrial revolution , mass production , subsequent lay@@ off and .
of course , breakthroughs in biology and electro@@ magne@@ tics .
back then , the Black Death plagued the European Contin@@ ent .
a group of young British who loved arts and literature fled to Geneva .
there they got bored and came up with the idea of telling a ghost story each day to kill time .
among them was an 18 @-@ year @-@ old girl named Mary Shel@@ ly .
she told a story about a scientist who combined the knowledge of biology , anatomy and electro@@ dynamics to create a new creature that had never existed on earth before .
that creature , in return , destroyed its creator .
this story was later written into a novel called Frank@@ en@@ stein .
which must be familiar to you all .
the story is universally accepted as the origin of modern science fiction .
it actually set a high standard for science fiction novels , as it targeted gene @-@ editing and ethical issues that still trouble people today .
do we have the right to create a new creature via technology ?
what will be the relationship between that creature and man ?
that &apos;s what science fiction is about .
as technology keeps advancing , human civilization as a whole is faced with anxieties concerning cognition , emotion , ethics and institution .
how does science fiction deal with such anxieties ?
those anxieties originate from information asym@@ metry and our in@@ comprehension and rejection of new things .
according to Arthur Clar@@ ke , man tends to overes@@ timate a technology &apos;s short @-@ term impact but underestimate its long @-@ term influence .
today , we will discuss science fiction as a literary genre and try to discover how it is different from romantic and Wu@@ xia novels , or realistic fiction .
what enables science fiction to process the anxieties concerning human civilization ?
I turn to seek help from three theor@@ ists in history .
some of their theories may help us understand how science fiction can achieve so .
this first one is Dar@@ ko Su@@ vin , who is a Croatian born Canadian j@@ ew .
in fact , he has a tough lef@@ tist background . based on Russian form@@ alism and from a poetic and aesthetic perspective .
he for the first time ever in history established a systematic science fiction theory .
why does it matter so much ?
because prior to that , all critics had reviewed science fiction novels from a perspective of mainstream literature , or rather traditional pure literature .
for example , in China , science fiction novels are widely considered readings for children .
some Chinese readers hold that the Three Body Problem does not have much &quot; liter@@ ar@@ iness . &quot;
with its characterization , particularly female characterization , being two @-@ dimensional and dull .
Dar@@ ko Su@@ vin &apos;s theory , however , provides a brand @-@ new coordinate system to distinguish science fiction from other literary gen@@ res .
he introduced a concept called &quot; cognitive e@@ strang@@ ement . &quot;
which remains very influential till this day .
what does that concept mean ?
let &apos;s look at his coordinate system to figure it out .
the vertical axis represents the degrees of cognition .
while the horizontal axis represents the stages of aesthetic and po@@ e@@ tical transition from natur@@ alism to e@@ strang@@ ement .
let me give you an example .
there &apos;s a saying that &quot; You reap what you sow . &quot;
this is very much in line with our understanding of the objective world and nature .
it is logically self @-@ consistent and allows us to perceive and understand it rationally .
so we can put &quot; You reap what you sow &quot; on the top left , namely , the genre of Chinese local literature .
what if &quot; You sow ses@@ ames and get mel@@ ons &quot; ?
this is in fact beyond our conventional cognition .
it is a phenomenon that is against our logic .
so let &apos;s just place it on the bottom right .
it may fall into the genre of myth , folk@@ lore , fantasy , or magic realism .
if I sow a sesame , transform it via bio @-@ gene technology and get a melon @-@ sized sesame .
that would fall into the category of science fiction literature on the top right .
this is in fact what is described in Xiao L@@ ING@@ T@@ ONG &apos;s Trav@@ els in the Future .
according to the story , one could get melon @-@ sized ses@@ ames by sowing ses@@ ames .
that &apos;s the concept of science fiction .
so now we know science fiction novels should be placed on top right of that coordinate system .
as we see , cognition and e@@ strang@@ ement are not a contradictory pair .
rather , they complement each other and are combined into an organic dialectical unity .
such a relationship turns science fiction reading into an intellectual experiment and adventure , which keeps challenging , breaking and re@@ shaping our cognitive and aesthetic limits .
the second theor@@ ist is a Korean American scholar named Se@@ o @-@ Young Chu . she graduated from Harvard and is now a teacher in New York .
in 2010 , she published a book called Do Met@@ aph@@ ors Dream of L@@ it@@ eral Sleep ? .
you can tell this book rhy@@ mes with the title of Philip K. Dick &apos;s classic novel Do Andro@@ ids Dream of Electric She@@ ep ? .
that book was later adapted into movie Bl@@ ade Run@@ ner .
in the book , Chu puts forward a radical view , that is , science fiction is a high @-@ intensity realism .
while traditional realism is merely a low @-@ intensity and low @-@ energy science fiction .
how can such an argument be valid ?
she directs us to ancient Greece in the Aristotle era , when all artistic and literary creations were im@@ itations and representations of reality .
in the industrial era , particularly in recent years .
however , with high @-@ tech@@ s keeping upgrading , the real picture of the world has been highly complicated and abstr@@ acted , transc@@ ending the limits of our daily experience .
traditional literary discourse can no longer effectively help imitate or represent the reality .
under such circumstances , metaphor emerges .
there are some rhetor@@ ics that must be familiar to you all .
for example , the earth is a village ; the Internet is an information super @-@ highway .
these are all metaph@@ ors used to explain abstract concepts .
there are numerous concepts alike , including globalization , cyberspace and the most @-@ talked @-@ about community with a shared future for mankind .
what &apos;s the most interesting thing in science fiction novels ?
for a rhetoric metaphor , the ontology and the metap@@ hor@@ ical object refer to the same thing .
again , take today &apos;s repeatedly mentioned Re@@ ady Player One as an example .
in Re@@ ady Player One , cyberspace is projected as an &quot; oasis &quot; - a virtual world in which the protagon@@ ist can shuttle back and forth for adventure .
the &quot; oasis &quot; in fact features a realistic function .
that is , playing a very important part in narr@@ ation while serving as a metaphor of cyberspace .
let &apos;s look at this picture .
this pig is almost as big as a little elephant .
next to it is a poem entitled &quot; Fat Pi@@ g Compe@@ tes with Ele@@ ph@@ ant . &quot;
this picture is a sati@@ re and metaphor of the agricultural fashion of bo@@ asting and exaggeration during the Great Le@@ ap Forward era .
however , this picture can also be understood as a dep@@ iction of Ele@@ ph@@ ant without N@@ ose , a classic 1958 science fiction by Chi Shu@@ chang .
in the novel , a pig , via gene modification , grows as big as an elephant .
readers of that science fiction can perceive and understand that pig from perspectives of science @-@ based realism and reality @-@ based metap@@ hor@@ ical language .
that shows how technology today keeps refreshing our cognition .
science fiction is a literary genre capable of dep@@ icting and representing complicated scenarios in reality with higher intensity and energy in a more comprehensive and panor@@ amic perspective .
so it is the biggest realism .
the third theor@@ ist may be even more familiar to you .
he is a well @-@ known Western theor@@ ist of mar@@ x@@ ism and post modernism .
his name is Fre@@ dri@@ c Jam@@ es@@ on .
in 2005 , he published a very influential work entitled Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ologies of the Future .
in this book , he considers science fiction to be an ideological framework which examines today from a future perspective and sees oneself from others &quot; perspective .
such an ideological framework enables us to form our critical &quot; cognitive mapping &quot; of the reality .
for him , science fiction is like a ut@@ opian @-@ style literary genre .
in nature , longing for ut@@ opia is an irre@@ du@@ cible instinct and essence of human existence .
just like Freud &apos;s sexual drive , it is an essence of human existence .
in this sense , science fiction is not about prediction or escape , but an experiment of imagination .
it is a mechanism inspiring perfec@@ tion@@ ism .
so it is just a theory of knowledge , rather than &quot; existence &quot; in ontology .
in the 20th Century , classic ut@@ opian literature , which was derived from U@@ top@@ ia , a masterpiece written by Thomas More in 15@@ 26 , lost its previous orth@@ odo@@ xy .
how come ?
the 20th Century witnessed two world wars , nuclear explosion and the Cold War .
after the Cold War , capitalism and con@@ su@@ mer@@ ism worked like prot@@ ons , blocking people &apos;s diversified ut@@ opian @-@ style imag@@ inations of the future from the mainstream discourse .
but Jam@@ es@@ on soon discovered that outside the mainstream discourse system there &apos;s a science fiction world .
which was marginalized and was a relatively closed circle .
inside this circle , ut@@ opia was used as a critical discourse to form dy@@ stop@@ ian fiction , a literary genre familiar to us .
it maintained an imagination and exploration of the future .
in fact , Jam@@ es@@ on has done a lot of research in ut@@ opian fic@@ tions of different periods .
and he discovered that in the USA in the 1960s @-@ 1970s .
a group of writers , particularly science fiction writers were keen on topics such as gender and ethnicity .
why ?
because patri@@ archy and technology were the two major elements that dominated then mainstream discourse of capitalist society and maintained hegemony .
it &apos;s worth mentioning that during that period .
Le@@ Gu@@ in one of my favorite anthropol@@ o@@ gists and also a well @-@ known science fiction &amp; fantasy writer , created a fiction entitled The Left Hand of Dar@@ k@@ ness .
the book is set on a fri@@ gid planet called Ge@@ then , or Winter , which is at dozens degrees below zero Celsius all the year round .
technology of this planet is advanced yet it is a feudal society .
unlike people on earth , people on that planet are a race of and@@ rog@@ yn@@ ous humans who maintain an inter @-@ sexual or and@@ rog@@ yn@@ ous state for two thirds of a month .
during e@@ str@@ us periods , when one meets another , there may be physiological , psychological or behavioral changes in both of them .
one may change to a male and the other to a female to allow intercourse .
it is noteworthy that such a sexual change is random .
in other words , at different times any individual may be either a man or a woman .
once &quot; she &quot; gets pregnant , she will keep being female until childbirth .
after that , she will return to an inter @-@ sexual state .
that &apos;s the world Le@@ Gu@@ in imagined .
the whole story centers on such an outlook or world view .
in the view of people on Ge@@ then , the male @-@ female binary gender system on earth is definitely sexual per@@ version .
why did Jam@@ es@@ on speak so highly of the ut@@ opian imagination in this work ?
there are two reasons .
first , it neg@@ ates gender politics by blur@@ ring gender boundary .
second , it depicts a high @-@ tech feudal society to neg@@ ate the historical determin@@ ism @-@ based view .
which forcibly relates capitalism with technological development in the mainstream discourse .
that &apos;s how Jam@@ es@@ on views science fiction .
he considers it an indirect strategy for us to understand our true self and seize the moment .
thus , such ut@@ opian and dy@@ stop@@ ian worlds were shaped .
writers have shaped a variety of &quot; others &quot; worlds , &quot; such as space opera , cyber@@ pun@@ k and post @-@ human era .
they neg@@ ate the reality by institutional means and make readers more aware of their &quot; state of imprisonment &quot; both spirit@@ ually and ide@@ ologically while reading such stories .
in this way , they retain an en@@ cl@@ ave for literary imagination in a real society .
thanks to this en@@ cl@@ ave , science fiction writing and criticism is not just textual production .
but also real intervention in social and political issues .
science fiction writers advance the ut@@ opian process of human nature and history in their novels .
that &apos;s my brief introduction of the three theor@@ ists and their views .
as we see , although their focuses vary .
they have invariably explored four relationships , namely , the relationship science fiction have with literature , technology , reality and future .
with the four relationships in mind , when reviewing Frank@@ en@@ stein , the Three Body Problem and even Xiao L@@ ING@@ T@@ ONG &apos;s Trav@@ els in the Future .
we will have a refreshed feeling .
anyway , theories are constantly renewing .
or rather , theories may be grey and dull , but the &quot; tree of life &quot; is forever green and vigorous .
why do writers create science fiction ?
take myself as an example .
looking back , when I was 13 , I read 2001 : a Space O@@ dys@@ sey by Arthur Clar@@ ke , who &apos;s also Liu ci@@ xin &apos;s favorite writer .
and I looked up at the sky , marvel@@ ing at the vast universe and feeling the tri@@ vi@@ ality of myself .
it is such an original affection and awe that drove me to pick up the pen to create a science fiction world of my own .
many people wonder if science fiction can eliminate my real @-@ life anxieties or not .
my answer is definitely NO .
for example , in my early science fiction career .
I could barely make any money out of it .
besides , I have to constantly struggle with deadline pressure , which is quite annoying .
from another perspective , science fiction writing allows me to experience a diversity of worlds , res@@ onate with many great souls in history .
and make friends with science fiction fans from around the world .
it &apos;s said that science fiction can eliminate the structural anxiety of human civilization as a whole .
what is structural anxiety ?
in recent years , I have been frequently asked , &quot; Will AI rob us of our jobs ?
will machine replace and even ens@@ la@@ ve humans ? &quot;
this is what I call the structural anxiety of human civilization as a whole .
to me , the answer is very simple .
it is better to embrace change than to worry about the unknown .
human species is no different from other species in the sense that they are all faced with the issues of birth , aging , illness and death .
eventually , mankind will go extinct .
let &apos;s assume that we can pass part of our human civilization onto the civilization of another species .
for example , we can keep many diversified archit@@ ectures and art forms on earth .
we can also send human information to the universe via signals .
it &apos;s like the golden record attached to V@@ oy@@ ager 2 .
or one day we may enable machine or other species to understand all about man , including our creations and feelings .
I bring a new copy of mine here today .
it &apos;s entitled Algorith@@ ms for Life .
in fact , I contributed six stories to this book .
all of them are about man @-@ machine relationships .
actually , at my invitation , Wang Yong@@ gang also contributed to this book .
Wang is my former colleague at Google and current C@@ TO of Sin@@ ov@@ ation Vent@@ ures .
he wrote a story about an AI robot which , by im@@ itating my writing style , becomes Chen Qi@@ u@@ fan 2.0 .
I Just need to input a keyword , my 2.0 version would present a number of literary works in my style .
so I piec@@ ed Chen Qi@@ u@@ fan 2.0 &quot; s writing with 1.0 &quot; s ( i.e. my writing ) together to form a new story .
it &apos;s my work of joint author@@ ship with AI about interactions between man and AI .
the funny thing is , I thought I completed a story with the help of AI robot .
but it turned out that I was used by AI to complete a literary work of its own .
that &apos;s it .
we all live in an age of noises and ro@@ ars , whether we are fans of 2@@ D culture , idol culture , computer games , Korean drama or movies .
the best way to deal with anxiety is to maintain an open and optimistic attitude to embrace the unknown , the future and the reality .
thank you all !
hello , everyone .
I &apos;m a doctor working on reproductive and genetic science .
I &apos;m 79 @-@ year @-@ old .
it &apos;s my dream , also my father &apos;s , to allow each couple to have a healthy baby .
you might assume that rare disease only occur rarely as the name has suggested .
however , there are a great variety of rare diseases .
the Human Gene Mut@@ ation Database now contains 2@@ 20,000 kinds of mutations involving over 8,000 mon@@ ogenic diseases .
so actually many people suffer from rare diseases , and rare diseases are not rare at all when we look at the number of infected patients .
there is a private research center for rare diseases in China and it has collected over 147 mon@@ ogenic diseases in our country .
I have over 30 years &apos; clinical experience on reproductive and genetic science , and we have discovered over 212 mon@@ ogenic diseases .
however , there are a total of 8,000 mon@@ ogenic diseases in the world , so I would say China is still in its early stage on rare disease research .
as a matter of fact , around 80 % of the rare diseases are genetic , which are caused by genetic mutation or chromos@@ om@@ al mutations .
once the disease starts to develop , it is a chronic process and lift @-@ threatening .
there isn &apos;t any cure yet and early prevention so far is the most effective method .
how can we prevent rare diseases ?
it is the doctors &apos; obligation to help each couple have a healthy baby , and you can take a picture here , which explains one of our interference approach to tackle rare diseases .
first of all , if a rare disease is found in a family , then people should visit our genetic counseling clinic , and our genetic counsel@@ ors will write down the family history for three generations .
we must have a clear idea of you family &apos;s medical conditions within three generations to see if there have had any similar conditions .
then , in line with your symptoms and the patterns of inheritance in your family , we can identify the most likely genetic mutation that you might have .
for example , Mr. Huang we have seen just now is a patient carrying an ach@@ on@@ dro@@ plasia @-@ prone gene .
this gene has now been cloned .
in the last century we had identified this gene , which had many ex@@ ons , but the early manual cloning process was very troublesome , and we needed to clone these ex@@ ons one by one .
however , with the completion of the H@@ GP ( Human Gen@@ ome Project ) , a large @-@ scale gene sequencing can be made possible , including the genome @-@ wide ex@@ on sequencing .
the cost for this screening is not expensive at all , and the screening will help you detect any genetic mutation among over 20,000 genes of mon@@ ogenic diseases .
the screening result is very helpful to our genetic counsel@@ ors .
we will do a similar screening to confirm the result .
at present there are two preventive methods .
the first one is prenatal diagnosis .
so , when you are pregnant , and someone in your family has some medical conditions .
I can help you do a prenatal diagnosis , including am@@ ni@@ oc@@ ent@@ esis and per@@ cutaneous um@@ bil@@ ical cord blood sampling , by doing so we can check the health status of the fetus .
if the fetus doesn &apos;t carry any can@@ cer@@ ous gene , then you could be relieved and carry on with your pregnancy .
but if the fetus does carry the gene , it is certain that the baby will get sick and the disease can be fatal .
in that case , an induced labor or abortion might be an option .
we believe that this method is rather passive .
you do the check@@ up only when you &apos;re pregnant , and the result will lead you two options only , either to keep the baby or to have an abortion .
but now , with the availability of in @-@ vitro fertilization ( IV@@ F ) technology , we can carry out a large number of pre @-@ pregnancy diagnosis , and this is a positive approach .
I will give you a brief introduction to prenatal diagnosis .
take a look at this couple .
this woman carries a Hem@@ oph@@ ilia @-@ A gene , and this disease is X @-@ linked .
in other words , if she is having a girl then the baby will be fine although she carries the disease ; if she is having a boy then the baby will certainly develop the disease .
so this woman came to us .
she already gave birth to a baby girl , who carried a Hem@@ oph@@ ilia @-@ A gene .
she is now pregnant , and she wants to find out whether the fetus is OK .
we then did her an am@@ ni@@ oc@@ ent@@ esis , and the result told us that the fetus did carry the same gene .
we offered her a number of options .
if the fetus had this mut@@ ant gene , were it a girl , would you want her or not , as she could still live normal ; but were it a buy , he would certainly develop the rare disease .
we later did a gender screening , and found out that it was a boy .
we told her the situation , informing her that her baby would certainly have the rare disease .
it was her call , either to accept a baby with a congenital medical con@@ dit@@ on or choose an abortion .
she decided to terminate the pregnancy at the time , and when she was ready to have another baby , she went to us for a pre @-@ pregnancy diagnosis .
this is a picture of pre @-@ pregnancy diagnosis .
we can tell that it is test @-@ tube baby in its 5th or 6th day .
it is the process that we all need to go through .
we first make a hole in the egg@@ shell , so that cells within the hole will come out .
we then use a very tiny straw to suck out three to five cells , as you know there is a negative pressure .
we then send the cells for genetic diagnosis .
as you could see , we have already identified the disease @-@ prone gene , so we can make a genetic diagnosis of the embryo .
if the embryo doesn &apos;t carry the gene , then we &apos;ll give it to you .
take the case we just talked about as an example , when the women is ready to have a new baby , we will help her perform this genetic diagnosis .
this method works very well .
although this disease is X @-@ linked , half of the boys will be normal while the other half will get sick .
we were unable to do a genetic diagnosis in the last century , so we did gender screening instead .
however , this gender diagnosis is unfair .
half of the boys that are normal don &apos;t have the chance to be born , but half of the girls , despite that they are carriers of the disease @-@ prone gene , are born and continue to pass on the disease @-@ prone gene .
so this pre @-@ implantation genetic diagnosis is a positive diagnosis , but it has to be based on advanced IV@@ F technology .
this is another example .
you might find this picture scary , but it is a very common tumor in pedi@@ at@@ rics .
it is called ret@@ in@@ ob@@ la@@ stom@@ a .
when still inside his mother &apos;s womb , the fetus started having can@@ cer@@ ation in its retina .
the onset of the disease happens very early .
in this case , the subject developed the disease when she was only two years old , you can see that her eye@@ ball began to stick out .
lucky her family was able to access high @-@ quality medical service and had her eye@@ ball removed , so the can@@ cer@@ ation didn &apos;t transfer to other parts of her body and she survived .
she got married at the age of 36 and was pregnant with a natural pregnancy .
we helped perform the am@@ ni@@ oc@@ ent@@ esis and discovered that the fetus was carrying the genetic mutation for ret@@ in@@ ob@@ la@@ stom@@ a .
so she chose to have an abortion .
she later came to us for genetic diagnosis .
there were four available embryos , of which only one of the four test @-@ tube babies had no can@@ cer@@ ous genes , therefore we chose to plant the healthy embryo into her body .
she later gave birth to a healthy baby .
and , of course , we later did a prenatal diagnosis and confirmed that the baby didn &apos;t carry the carcin@@ ogenic genes .
this is our country &apos;s first cancer @-@ free baby , born in 2015 .
how is the latest progress of this technology in China ?
last year , Nature , an elite academic journal in the world , published an article entitled &quot; China P@@ ush For The Better Baby . &quot;
this article gave an introduction of our hospital , and I am a doctor from Re@@ productive and Gen@@ etic Hospital of C@@ IT@@ IC @-@ Xiang@@ ya .
till the year when the article was published on Nature , we handled more than 4@@ 1,000 IV@@ F cases , of which over 2,@@ 5@@ 40 cases involved the diagnosis of rare diseases .
you know what , these 2,@@ 5@@ 40 cases performed in our hospital in one year accounted for one @-@ fourth of the number in the US .
as of now , we have handled nearly 9,000 cases involving the diagnosis of rare diseases , of which over 2,000 babies were born and 1,200 still in their mothers &apos; wom@@ bs , the rest are still being frozen in the embryo bank .
that is to say , after the continuous hard work by scientists for so many years , China is now in the forefront position on this research in the world .
we can look at a new case .
multiple oste@@ och@@ on@@ dro@@ ma is a disease that will grow tumors everywhere in the body , anywhere with cartilage ; and it has to be removed by a medical surgery .
this woman , with a multiple oste@@ och@@ on@@ dro@@ ma @-@ prone gene , originally didn &apos;t plan to have a baby .
she later came to us upon learning about the gene @-@ editing program in our hospital .
she has given birth to a healthy baby , and is ready to have a second child .
you know cancer has the second highest mortality rate in China .
lung cancer is the cancer with the highest morbidity rate in China , followed by gastric colon cancer and breast and ovarian cancer .
now , I would like to tell you a story about Angel@@ ina Julie .
she is now widely regarded as a brave cancer fighter .
after undergoing a genetic diagnosis , one of the most important discovery in the last century , she was aware that she was the carrier of BR@@ CA@@ 1 and BR@@ CA@@ 2 , the genes of breast cancer .
her great grandmother , her mother and her aunt were all breast cancer patients , and both her great grandmother and her mother died in a painful way .
her aunt was still alive at that time , and by applying the latest technology at that time , she did a genetic screening of cancer and found out that she carried breast cancer genes .
Angel@@ ina Julie decided to remove both of her breasts , before the age of 40 , it was a sort of preventive surgical resection .
she even plans to remove her ov@@ aries by the age of 50 , as BR@@ CA@@ 1 gene can cause breast and ovarian cancer .
but she didn &apos;t wait that long .
several years later , she developed ovarian lesions and had her ov@@ aries removed .
she &apos;s still alive and in good health , because of the preventive surgical resection .
but unfortunately her aunt developed the breast cancer prior to the release of the cancer genetic screening report , and she soon passed away .
Julie &apos;s story tells us that genetic tumor might be a rare disease , but it is not rare at all within a family .
so , if there is someone in your family has bowel cancer before the age of 30 or 50 and someone in his family within three generations had cancers , or two of your siblings have the same cancer , you need to be highly suspicious that it might be a genetic tumor and the disease is caused by a can@@ cer@@ ous gene .
if the cancer is caused by gene mutation , then it is very likely that 50 % of your offspring &apos;s will carry the same cancer gene , and 85 % of your offspring &apos;s with the gene will have cancer in their lives .
this story therefore remind us of the importance of prevention and control of genetic tumors .
we launched a program last year , by offering free screening for cancer patients .
there was a 72 @-@ year @-@ old man suffering from breast cancer .
you might find it odd that how can a man will have breast cancer , as breast cancer is widely believed to be a female exclusive disease ; but it is not .
our screening found out that there was a BR@@ CA@@ 1 gene mutation .
then all his other family members went through the same screening .
we told them that at least 50 % of them should have regular health examination .
that would include regular breast examination and ovarian examination .
like myself , my elder sister passed away because of colon cancer before the age of 50 .
I knew that I was a high @-@ risk patient myself , as she was so young when passing away .
at that time there wasn &apos;t any cancer gene screening available .
when I turned 50 years old , I decided to have an enter@@ oscopy check@@ up each year .
when I was near 70 years old , I was diagnosed with colon poly@@ ps and I had them all removed in time ; when I was 76 years old , I was diagnosed with aden@@ oid tumor , I immediately had it removed as well .
I will have this kind of physical examination once every year .
you see , colon cancer is a chronic process , but it is also a high @-@ risk disease in China with a relatively high death rate , and that is why I will keep doing the health check@@ up for a long time .
the reason why I can still live he@@ ath@@ ily is largely due to my constant attention to the development of cancer and regular health examinations .
rare diseases and inherited cancers are basically the same , they are all mon@@ ogenic disease , so how can we prevent and treat these diseases ?
I &apos;m a specialist working on assisted reproductive technology , and therefore it is my dream .
I think that it is my responsibility to help you have a healthy baby .
I want to make this message clear to our female friends .
the period between 35 and 45 is regarded as the clim@@ ac@@ ter@@ ic stage , the period between 45 and 50 is the pre@@ menop@@ aus@@ al stage , the period between 50 and 55 is menopause , while the 55 or above is regarded as the old age .
youth is gone forever , just like me , I &apos;m an old woman now .
for women , we are infer@@ tile for at least one third of our time in our lives .
so , please don &apos;t come to me when you are over 40 years old , &quot; Ms. Lu , I &apos;m still young and in good health , and I want to have a baby . &quot;
why ?
because your ov@@ aries are aging .
it is best to give birth to a baby when you are 20 years old .
when you are older , especially after 35 years old , the number of eggs and quality of ov@@ aries decrease sharply , and the odds for having a baby with birth defects are on the rise .
China saw a rising number of pre@@ implantation genetic diagnosis ( P@@ G@@ D ) and pre@@ implantation genetic screening ( P@@ GS ) in the year 20@@ 16 , it was largely due to the rising number of older women wishing to have a baby .
many ensuing problems will occur , the number and quality of your eggs will decrease and risk of chromos@@ om@@ al disease is higher , such as tr@@ is@@ om@@ ic syndrome .
why do we need to screen Down syndrome ?
it is something to do with advanced maternal age .
I want to make this message clear , there should be an age limit for late marriage .
at least you should have your first child before the age of 30 , despite that you are busy with your work .
you can have your second child when you are 35 , as China is implementing a two @-@ child policy now .
by doing so , you can have two healthy babies .
apart from helping you give birth to a healthy baby , we also help you maintain your health by freezing sperm or eggs .
for example , we have the world &apos;s largest sperm bank in Hunan , also a very large egg bank and a frozen embryo bank .
as of now we have frozen over 200,000 IV@@ F embryos .
China loos@@ ened its family planning policy in 20@@ 16 , as a result , over 1000 couples required us to un@@ freeze the frozen embryo that they had stored in our frozen embryo bank , as they wanted to have a second child .
so I think it is a good solution .
I know that it is a fashionable thing for women to freeze their eggs nowadays .
some women are extremely busy with their work and remain single .
they want to freeze their eggs for future use , and we can accept this kind of mentality .
but other women are not willing to give birth to a baby for the fear of losing their slim body , they want to freeze their eggs and find a sur@@ rogate mother to use the frozen eggs in the future .
I &apos;m totally against this kind of practice .
Xu Jing@@ le@@ i made headline news lately .
I had no idea why she wanted to freeze her eggs .
I will encourage every woman to give birth to a baby of their own by themselves , through natural delivery .
only by doing so , you will become mature physically and mentally .
prior to your pregnancy , you won &apos;t have this kind of maternal love .
it is necessary for a woman to become a real woman through the pregnancy process , and her internal environment will have a major change .
I don &apos;t agree with the D@@ IN@@ K family either .
this is my opinion .
we also carry on researches on stem cells , and we have set up China &apos;s first national engineering center for human stem cells .
we store frozen stem cells .
for example , we will store frozen embryos .
IV@@ F is now a mature technology and we will use the ov@@ ulation induction treatment , in other words , sometimes we can have 20 to 30 eggs at a time , so in theory we can produce at least a dozen of embryos .
but I can only give you up to two embryos , as China is now implementing a two @-@ child policy .
after you are pregnant , you can freeze your remaining embryos .
you might use these frozen embryos when necessary ; or you can donate them for embryonic stem cell line research .
embryonic stem cell line can be very useful , and you might use it in your family .
say , your liver is damaged in the future , and we can induce the embryonic stem cell to produce a hepatic cell , which can be further implanted into your body .
I am going to tell you another story , it is about a rare disease called hepat@@ ol@@ entic@@ ular degeneration .
it is also a mon@@ ogenic disease , and patients with this disease are unable to handle the copper metabolism .
when there is such a gene mutation , copper accum@@ ulates in our body and will lead to brain disease or liver cirr@@ hosis .
take a look at this picture , you can notice that there is something surrounding the eyes , look at the arrow over there , and that is copper being accumulated there .
after having this rare disease , the patients will eventually die from brain disease or liver disease .
the purpose of this story is tell you the significance of embryonic stem cell .
for example , it can be used to treat liver failure .
we can use the embryonic stem cell as a form of targeted drug , which is effective to treat liver disease .
in addition , we can use the embryonic stem cell to produce a liver bud and later an organ , which can be used to treat the liver disease .
moreover , we can make an artificial liver with the embryonic stem cell .
we can produce a liver through the 3D printing technology , provided that we have applied the embryonic stem cell in inducing liver cells in the first place .
it is not a far @-@ away dream , as we have successfully induced the embryonic stem cell into liver cells .
to be honest , the treatment mechanism for this rare metabolic disease is rather simple .
we only need a tiny liver bud to be implanted into our body , and it will produce enzymes , so that copper metabolism can be made normal again .
to us that is a new approach to deal with rare diseases .
we can use embryonic stem cell to induce the cells we want , so as to treat different diseases .
to me , that is our future .
scientists are working in this direction .
you can tell that I &apos;m an old lady near to the age of 80 .
I keep telling the significance of having a healthy lifestyle .
I personally also do physical exercise regularly .
you can take a look at this picture , that is me and my Be@@ et@@ le car .
me and my Be@@ et@@ le have almost become a tourist attraction in Changsha , &quot; An old lady is driving the car , please be considerate . &quot;
I learned how to drive when I was 69 , but my students tried to persuade me , &quot; Ms. Lu , please don &apos;t drive at your age , and the traffic condition is rather poor too . &quot;
I relied that what was the point of learning driving and having a driver license if I didn &apos;t drive .
to me , driving is a sort of technique , and I feel great when I &apos;m driving .
I have been driving for more than 10 years , with this little Be@@ et@@ le .
I will drive my car to the hospital at 6 am each day , as I don &apos;t want to get stuck in the traffic .
after arriving at the hospital , I will do 100 times of sit @-@ ups .
I also spend time lifting dum@@ b@@ bells .
you see , muscle can age rapidly when you are old .
our bones can break easily if we don &apos;t do enough physical exercises .
there is a calcium pump in our muscle .
if your muscle is not strong enough , the pump won &apos;t transfer the calcium to the bone ; and in that case it is useless in taking calcium tablets , it will only cause kidney stones in your body if you don &apos;t do exercise .
so it is important to do exercise , especially for elderly people , and your upper limbs can easily shrink .
for example , I lift dum@@ b@@ bells .
you can tell my muscle is as tough as the iron , and I &apos;m an old lady that is almost 80 .
thank you .
you can take a look at this picture here , that is me playing a basketball game organized by my school when I was 76 .
I think my physical condition is wonderful .
actually I have a heavy workload , and a healthy lifestyle is very important to me .
I don &apos;t take any medication , and I only stick to a healthy lifestyle .
how do we live healthy ?
first of all , you need to do exercise .
I now spend at least one hour on doing exercise each day .
I used to climb mountains a lot , and I even visited Tibet when I was 69 years old .
I didn &apos;t have any altitude sickness at all .
I climb mountain , I swim and do other forms of exercises .
you know , rest breeds rust .
secondly mind the food we eat , and we need to have a healthy diet .
China &apos;s Health Commission has announced a recommended healthy diet for Chinese people .
I now eat over half @-@ kil@@ o of vegetables each day , including half of the green @-@ leaf vegetables and another half of vegetables of different colors , you know , colored vegetables contain different essential micro@@ elements .
I have been doing this for so many years .
when I was 70 years old , they told me that I had diabetes , saying that &quot; Ms. Lu , I won &apos;t give you any medicine at all , because you have the perseverance to do anything . you need to do exercise and have a healthy diet . &quot;
when I was 78 years old , they told me that &quot; Ms. Lu , your diabetes is gone . &quot;
I was very happy about it , I didn &apos;t expect me to be that good at such an old age .
doing exercise and having a healthy diet proved to work well with me , and I even shook off diabetes .
I walk fast in the hospital , and I even climb stairs fast , much faster than those young people .
I hope that everyone can live to their nine@@ ties , and stay in healthy in their sev@@ enties and eigh@@ ties .
I wish that you can continue to think and learn new things , and have a high quality life to the end of your life .
thank you .
hi , everyone .
I &apos;m Tang B@@ ins@@ en , CEO of a social gaming company .
today , I &apos;d like to talk about computer games and globalization .
my speech has two parts , firstly games and then globalization .
as the boss of a game company , I travel overseas quite often .
I have been to many countries .
my trips over the past few years have made me become more and more proud as a Chinese .
why ?
when I was in the underdeveloped countries , I found their people , despite being poor , didn &apos;t seem to care much about making money .
they always spent whatever money they had made .
to me , they appeared to make no attempt to make progress .
the people in developed countries had one month or two for holidays in a year .
the companies there didn &apos;t seem to be stressed about having their Chinese competitors closing up on them .
I thought Chinese companies might out@@ pace them one day .
these trips gave me a sense of pride and superiority for being a Chinese .
I thought Chinese would become a people of influence and excellence , while part of me fret@@ ted over the lifestyles and attitudes towards life of the people in other countries .
until one day I watched a movie , P@@ aths of the Sou@@ l .
it told a story that changed my mind .
what &apos;s the story about ?
it was about a group of religious Tibetan villagers setting out from home on a pilgri@@ mage to the Pot@@ ala Palace .
with a full pro@@ stration every three steps , they brav@@ ed the long painstaking journey against all odds .
as I was watching the movie , I wondered why these poor villagers had to make the journey despite the hardships , col@@ dness and hunger on the road .
what was their aspiration ?
not to mention that one of them died halfway through the journey .
later I had an epi@@ ph@@ any .
I came to realize that their lives were not inferior to ours .
they were living for a faith , which they believed was the most worthy of all fai@@ ths .
they have truly lived because they devoted their time to something they believed to be most valuable .
as far as Chinese are concerned , the people in many other countries ove@@ rem@@ phas@@ ize the enjoyment of life rather than keeping their noses to the gr@@ ind@@ stone .
but now I hope we can learn to respect the lifestyles of others as every one of us is living for something we believe to be most valuable .
last year I read a book , S@@ api@@ ens : a Brief History of Hu@@ mankind , which sends us a simple message .
the message is that humankind &quot; trust the fig@@ ments of their collective imagination . &quot;
something holds value as long as we believe so .
otherwise , it is valu@@ eless .
based on these arguments , the book concludes that human beings are creatures of ide@@ alism , rather than materialism .
so I think belief can be put into either objective or virtual things .
they have value as long as we believe so .
computer games , in my opinion , are a kind of belief that can grant people satisfaction in the same way religions inspire their believers .
ringing the opening bell on the day of their IPO exc@@ ites the star@@ tu@@ ps owners , and money exhilar@@ ates the bread@@ winners .
in our games , many players have found fulfilment .
here &apos;s an example .
in one of our games , there are about 100 players who have made in @-@ game purchases amounting to more than one million dollars .
in other words , what they paid can buy a house .
some of you find it absurd , thinking they must be a bunch of idi@@ ots who blew one million dollars on nothing .
but let me tell you , they paid one million dollars for an experience .
how many of you here today are willing to pay one million dollars for anything other than a house ?
what is worth of that much money in your mind ?
have you ever thought about it ?
now let me tell you the stories of some of the players .
one of the players , as the leader of a guil@@ d in the game , led his people into battles .
to boost their chances of victory , he plough@@ ed one million dollars into the guil@@ d .
is it worth it ?
his noble act has won him applause and reverence in the guil@@ d .
I think he contributed to the guil@@ d the same way as Dong C@@ un@@ ru@@ i , who blew himself up in order to destroy a Kuomintang bunker during the Chinese Civil War , did for the Chinese Communist Party .
both of them were willing to give everything they had for their beliefs .
you may take this player for a fool , whereas I see him as a champion who has had one of his finest moments in life .
another player in a game wants to have better weaponry and gear to make his character stronger .
I think he shares the same goal with you who paid for today &apos;s lecture .
why ?
you believe our lectures can increase your earning potential and make you more powerful , in the same way he thinks what better weaponry and gear can do for himself .
according to Mas@@ low &apos;s hierarchy of needs , things like food and water are human &apos;s most fundamental needs .
only the needs at the top of the pyramid , such as self @-@ actu@@ alization and self @-@ fulfillment , can truly give human a sense of enormous satisfaction .
computer games provide an scenario in which individuals can seek self @-@ actu@@ alization and the sense of enormous satisfaction .
the way I see it , there are no such things as good or bad beliefs .
what matters is that you truly believe in something and you are willing to give it your all .
even if it means you have to spend one million dollars , you can still be happy when you find satisfaction in your beliefs .
as the CEO of a social gaming company , I have been busy developing new games and hardly had time to play any game over the past few years .
but last year I finally found some time to indulge myself .
through playing games I suddenly dic@@ o@@ vered a new kind of fun .
back in college I used to lo@@ athe some of my classmates who I thought were de@@ generates and wasted much of their precious time playing .
but now I no longer see them that way .
when they were playing games , they have achieved self @-@ fulfillment .
here we have a picture from a movie called The Mat@@ rix .
you probably have seen this picture .
what &apos;s the movie about ?
it depicts a dy@@ stop@@ ian future in which humanity is un@@ knowingly trapped inside a simulated reality called the Mat@@ rix .
when I was watching the movie , I thought that might be a great future for us because we &apos;re provided with enormous satisfaction and excitement .
I &apos;m not sure if you all agree with me .
but I think our society is evolving in that direction , pushed by a number of novel@@ ties in recent years , such as block@@ chain and virtual currencies .
I reckon that for a long time to come , computer games are one of the best ways for us to seek the ultimate psychological excitement , grati@@ fication , and self @-@ actu@@ alization .
the sens@@ ations they provide can be as overwhelming as the bliss a startup owner has for ringing the opening bell on the day of the IPO .
or the thrill an ordinary office worker feel for receiving a 20,000 @-@ yuan pay@@ check at the end of the month .
so I think games provide a way for us to realize self @-@ actu@@ alization .
okay , enough about games .
let &apos;s move on to globalization .
before that , we have to talk about the Chinese market .
here we have a histo@@ gram of five columns , which represent America , China , South Korea , Britain and Japan , respectively .
take a guess at which one of them represents China .
the data of this histo@@ gram comes from a third @-@ party survey on the spending power of game players in each country , namely , the average revenue per user .
which one do you think stands for China ?
well , the second one is China while Britain lands at the bottom .
I believe that judging from this histo@@ gram alone , you would see China as a developed country , rather than a developing one .
Japan comes out on top .
in fact , as the head of a gaming company quite active in overseas market expansion , I have a message for you .
China is a market with tremendous potential .
it has been and will be so , if not more promising .
the Chinese market will hold a significant place in the picture of the international Internet industry , with the spending power of Chinese increasingly growing .
here are some numbers when we started overseas market expansion .
in Brazil , one of our first target markets , we made about one million dollars in one month , coming in the first .
that was in 20@@ 19 .
at that time the GDP per capita of Brazil , if I recall correctly , was 7,000 dollars , and that of China was somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000 dollars .
now in 20@@ 18 the GDP per capita of China comes near 9,000 dollars , whereas that of Brazil remains the same , 7,000 dollars .
the best @-@ selling game in Brazil now , according to my estimation , makes about 15 million yuan .
what does that mean ?
any game in the app stores like op@@ po &apos;s or vivo &apos;s could make about 10 million yuan .
so now you can see what a promising market China is .
recently many countries have tried to follow the footsteps of China .
well , they certainly have achieved their goal population @-@ wise .
let &apos;s take India as an example , which is determined to become the next China .
having been expanding international market for nearly ten years , I &apos;m afraid there might not be another market like China .
why ?
metap@@ hor@@ ically speaking , I think both China and America are like two operating systems .
they have their own languages , industrial standards , search engines , social networks and e @-@ commerce platforms .
does any other country in the world has these things ?
and its own language at the same time ?
let &apos;s take a look at India .
with English being one of its official languages , India naturally shares a bond with America .
all of its first @-@ rate talents work in America .
its middle class enjoys services provided by American companies , which is another proof of its tie with America .
what does these facts say about India ?
do you think it &apos;s poss@@ bile for He@@ fei , my hometown , to become the next Beijing ?
it &apos;s inevitable for He@@ fei @-@ born talents to seek jobs in Beijing .
in the future , Beijing , Shanghai , Shenzhen , and some cities in America are the few places across the world that can attract top @-@ notch talents .
without any means to retain its most outstanding talents , a country can never become a operating @-@ system @-@ like market .
it will be an application @-@ like market at best .
what does application @-@ like mean ?
I think Israel , for example , is one of such countries .
it focuses on innovation of the applications in America and China .
so these countries are only entitled to bonus generated by applications .
when we think any of these country is becoming the next China , think again .
I don &apos;t think these application @-@ like countries will see any significant growth in their GDP per capita for a very long time to come .
but the GDP per capita of China will continue to soar .
here are some other reasons why we should value the Chinese market .
during our last trip to India , we wanted to find a place to have dinner and sing kar@@ ao@@ ke in one evening .
but when we came back from the school to our hotel , it was already 11 o &apos;@@ ol@@ co@@ k at night .
we spent four hours on the road , which has been the case of our trip every day .
later I came to realize the significance of adequate infrastructure to a country .
without it , the people in that country would waste a substantial amount of time in opening up channels , developing logistics and acquiring information .
which leaves them no time to buy what they want .
now China provides a very sophisticated envi@@ ro@@ ment for consumers .
for example , We@@ Chat Pay and China &apos;s adequate infrastructure have given Chinese people a lot of time to spend their money .
let me ask you a question .
what do we do with the time saved by We@@ Chat Pay ?
we spend it in buying what we want .
in China , the development of the Internet @-@ centric infrastructure over the past decade will create a booming market for consumers .
back in the days when the GDP per capita of China stood at 6,000 dollars , each Chinese on average only had 1,000 dollars to spare after buying a house and a car .
it is the same case with today &apos;s Indians .
they barely have money to spare after buying houses and cars , and paying telephone bills .
in the future each Chinese on average would probably have 10,000 dollars to spare after buying houses and cars .
just image how much potential China has as a market .
I &apos;m not saying we shouldn &apos;t expand overseas .
what I mean is that the world @-@ class enterprises in the future will emerge only in China and America .
because these two sophisticated markets can provide adequate support .
the Econom@@ ist@@ once did an analysis , in which it concluded that the world @-@ class enterprises must emerge in strong hom@@ emar@@ kets .
here are my questions .
why were Facebook , Google and Microsoft born in America ?
why were Hua@@ wei , Lenovo and Xia@@ om@@ i born in China ?
it &apos;s because of the sophisticated Chinese market .
so I think in the future Chinese companies seeking internationalization must first take firm root in China , and make the best of their competitive edges and local resources .
without significant he@@ ft in their hom@@ emar@@ ket , they cannot become multin@@ ation@@ als .
no American company has first achieved success overseas and then pre@@ dominated its hom@@ emar@@ ket .
internationalization doesn &apos;t work that way .
so I think one of the rules here is that there &apos;s no room for localization in the picture of true globalization .
let me tell you a story .
back in 2009 , social networking websites mush@@ ro@@ omed across the world .
among them are Brazil &apos;s Or@@ k@@ ut funded by Google and some locally @-@ operated websites in Germany , Denmark , the Netherlands , India and Vietnam .
at that time we &apos;re thinking .
could Facebook take out its locally @-@ operated competitors ?
and our answer is .
it couldn &apos;t .
why ?
because we thought many Chinese Internet companies had beaten Facebook with the help of localization .
their German and Brazilian counterparts could do the same .
therefore , we placed our bet on these local Internet companies .
we even provided a platform that linked them together and ran our games on it .
it was us against Facebook .
later I took a trip to Germany and met with the CEO of a local social networking website .
at that time , they were the No.1 website and Facebook ranked fifth there .
he said something that made me feel their battle was a lost cause .
what did he say ?
he said that 50 out of its 200 employees were developing an interface similar to Facebook .
this interface was capable of dynamic loading without refreshing .
it sounded promising and the product would soon be launched .
but why did my heart sink ?
because Facebook had 2,000 employees .
50 of them were doing the same thing and the remaining 1,9@@ 50 were doing things beyond the capabilities of this German website .
why did Facebook have 2,000 employees ?
because Facebook had a huge mar@@ t@@ ket to support these 2,000 employees .
its main focus was in the North America market , which was big enough to do so .
the Internet industry is a sector in which the economies of scale play a significant role .
the bigger scale a company has and the more it invests , the better products it makes .
later Facebook crushed those local companies and became a 10,000 @-@ employee company .
it invested more technologies in productions , wiping out its competitors with its products tailored to the finest detail .
the advent of the era of globalization presents a chal@@ lege to each and every locally @-@ operated enterprise .
if you don &apos;t have the capabilities and scale of operation up to the standard of globalization .
you will be destroyed in a blink of an eye by some company on the other side of the world .
the con@@ verse of the rule also applies .
successful localization can be used as a strategy to survive in the wave of globalization .
what does it mean ?
that is , if a company offers quality products and has its unparalleled characteristics , it can use these edges in global expansion .
you may wonder .
why doesn &apos;t it work in China ?
I think there are many reasons , including China &apos;s policies .
it huge domestic market provides a solid safety net for local companies to compete against their international rivals .
but the companies in smaller countries , without strong hom@@ emar@@ kets , do not stand a chance against their American competitors .
when we tapped into overseas markets , we had one belief .
we believed that fundamentally people share the same habits .
the un@@ char@@ ted markets tend to present opportunities in the disguise of difficulties .
with this belief in mind , we started looking for the un@@ char@@ ted markets .
we believed these lands were full of opportunities waiting to be seized .
this is something we think an international company should be doing .
there &apos;s a saying : the world is flat .
in the book of the same title , many enterprises are considered the &quot; bull@@ do@@ zers of globalization . &quot;
what does it mean ?
they are fl@@ atten@@ ing the world .
we are one of these enterprises .
this leads us to another theory that true globalization is a kind of insti@@ ll@@ ation of values .
twenty years ago we didn &apos;t have Coca @-@ Cola or K@@ FC .
we Chinese have never heard either of them before .
the Americans weren &apos;t sure if they appealed to Chinese .
but with their country &apos;s international he@@ ft , they managed to in@@ still these two things into our culture .
a true glob@@ alized enterprise should be capable of promoting and insti@@ l@@ ling its own values worldwide .
it should be capable of disseminating what it thinks is right across the world .
last but not least , I want to say that the core of globalization is the integration of the world .
that is , the world is becoming flatter and flatter .
we have seen companies that makes the world flatter and flatter coming along , such as Google and Facebook .
these companies allow us to connect with one another .
but if we ove@@ rem@@ phas@@ ize localization and reject integration in such context , we are sailing directly into the wind .
here is an example I often use .
the companies exploring the Chinese market would never focus on a single region , be it Guangdong Province or Hunan Province .
it is more true in overseas market expansion .
for a very long time to come , the overall scale of overseas markets will shrink , compared with the Chinese market .
in such context , no company can operate in these markets without a globalization perspective .
if we single out these markets one by one and operate in them separately , it &apos;s an dead end .
so what should we do ?
here are some examples .
in the future , the size of the Jan@@ pan@@ ese market might be as small as that of Zhejiang Province .
the size of the entire Southeast Asian market might be equal to that of Guangdong Province .
the Indian market might be the same size as Fujian Province .
what capability do we need ?
we need to be capable of integrating these markets into one , just like the American and Silicon Valley companies did before .
only this kind of companies have competitive edges in the forthcoming waves of globalization .
thank you .
we all know there &apos;s no such thing as a free lunch , but is there any free software ?
answers may vary from person to person .
for most of the Chinese people , including us here today .
I bet the answer is &quot; Yes , &quot; or a meaningful smile .
we &apos;ve got accustomed to numerous offerings of free products .
but surely the word &quot; free &quot; can be put in quotes .
and sometimes the free products we use might also be pirated .
on the contrary , for most Europeans and Americans , the answer to that question might be &quot; No . &quot;
for they have to pay huge amounts of money - from billions to tens of billions or even hundreds of billions per year - to tech giants like Microsoft , Adobe , Sy@@ man@@ tec and In@@ tu@@ it .
compare the two , and we may wonder why one pays while the other does not .
is it because of different habits , or cultural differences , or does it just display a gap in development ?
that &apos;s a very important question .
if we can &apos;t find a clear answer , then we might classify paid and free products merely as different business models .
which we generally attribute to different business pro@@ pen@@ si@@ ties in different regions .
in that case , we might be mis@@ led when we are making a forecast .
and sometimes our big strategies might prove not so well @-@ grounded .
according to traditional economic theories , what &apos;s the essence of business ?
the essence of business is the exchange of value .
producers provide products and services , while the market gives them enough remuneration .
I think that &apos;s the most basic logic by which business normally runs and business models normally work .
using this logic , let &apos;s imagine , what does the free software want in return ?
free software , too , requires attempts to launch varied products and relentless work of programmers who develop those products and help promote them .
for those people , what &apos;s there to get in return ?
a business model will never work if there is no adequate remuneration .
recently , Li Shu@@ fu , the chairman of Ge@@ ely Autom@@ obile Holdings , was reported to suspect that Ma Hu@@ at@@ eng , the CEO of T@@ enc@@ ent , must know all our business secrets .
for not a word we say on We@@ Chat can el@@ ude him .
there was also a famous jur@@ ist who warned us about the fact that .
when we are using 12@@ 30@@ 6 to book flights or train tickets , the app usually asks for access to our albums .
some people thus joke that our chance of getting a ticket might depend on how good @-@ looking we are .
these two examples , what are they telling us ?
even software products as massive , successful and widespread as We@@ Chat and 12@@ 30@@ 6 could .
too , neglect people &apos;s privacy and have a lot of problems inside .
think about it .
if a normal business model doesn &apos;t exist .
then what else method can the free software products use to get remuneration ?
given the unequal and unclear exchange of value .
the so @-@ called free software products may have no choice but change into sp@@ y@@ ware , traffic @-@ hi@@ jack software , unauthorized applications , fake remote control software or embedded advertising software .
therefore a software product based on a business model featuring an unclear and opaque exchange of value might prompt the birth of a gray industry and the value oppression .
and what &apos;s worse , it might even make the entire software industry shrink .
so whether the software is free or not has nothing to do business models .
it has everything to do with which stage of development the market is located at .
why did I say so ?
as one who has been working in the software industry for over ten years .
I think we can talk about the development of the software market from the following aspects .
the software market was , at its earliest stage , filled with free products .
those products , since they couldn &apos;t always match the users &apos; demand , or create solid , satisfying value for them .
could only count on the additional advertising revenues for remuneration .
conversely , however , if our products become an increasingly rigid demand .
if we earn higher and higher customer stic@@ kin@@ i@@ ess , then we might let people pay .
let &apos;s see why so many companies prefer to buy the paid financial software .
because such software is a rigid demand .
but for the paid financial product companies would never be able to do the book@@ keeping , or operate in a more efficient , or even normal , manner .
as software develops , service software products might emerge .
so what does that mean ?
it means that payment won &apos;t be only a one @-@ time thing , but could also be continuous .
let me give you an example .
it might sound inappropriate here , but let &apos;s just take it as an analogy .
today we are all customers of telecom operators such as China Mobile and China Unicom .
besides the first payment we made for our membership , we also have to pay them every month .
why ?
because their services are a rigid demand for us .
so whether a software product is free , or paid , or continuously paid for its services .
is actually linked directly with how rigid it is as a demand .
there is also another kind of market in the world that we call the &quot; market of pirated software . &quot;
people needn &apos;t pay in such markets , for all the products , when they were obtained , cost nothing at all .
such markets were prevalent in China ten , or even five , years ago .
from this perspective , pirated software market is actually even inferior to the free software market .
a few years ago , there was a very capable , heavy @-@ weight person in the sector of free software .
he is Zhou Hong@@ yi , CEO of the Internet security company Qi@@ hoo 360 .
he boasts on many occasions about how Qi@@ hoo 360 &apos;s free software products have successfully disp@@ elled their paid rivals out of the market .
as I , a by@@ stan@@ der , see it from the perspective of the entire industry , he is not 100 percent right on that .
Qi@@ hoo 360 did launch free products like anti @-@ virus software , and it did , on the surface , kick other anti @-@ virus software providers such as Jiang@@ min out of the market .
but the truth is , as those aged over 40 might remember , during that time , the mainstream anti @-@ virus products were not those paid ones provided by Jiang@@ min or R@@ ising .
instead , free anti @-@ virus products from K@@ as@@ pers@@ ky and Nor@@ ton were occupying the lion &apos;s share of the market .
in that sense , free software products indeed have their own advantages .
when can those advantages work ?
only when they are in a market that is flooded with pirated products .
in a market that is characterized by paid software products , they will , however , lose their strengths .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s going on recently in the software market .
Del@@ o@@ it@@ te has announced this year &apos;s Technology Fast 500 winners .
they are the top 500 companies in North America that are leading in the rate of growth .
there is a very interesting thing in Del@@ o@@ it@@ te &apos;s report .
as we can see from the figures that cover several years on end , compared with 20@@ 17 , 20@@ 19 has seen a big shift .
the number of companies represented by the black columns in this chart is increasing .
who exactly are those companies ?
they are companies that charge money and make money through their paid software .
we can see that such companies account for 60 percent of all the Fast 500 winners .
that means , according to Del@@ o@@ it@@ te &apos;s report , 60 percent of the fastest @-@ growing companies in North America are paid software providers .
and most of these companies can charge money directly through their own products .
they have witnessed a surging growth .
during the last three years , their average annual growth rate has surpassed 300 % .
what does that mean ?
Europe and America , as mature markets for paid software .
unlike what many Chinese people thought , has left little chance for those free software products .
quite the contrary , the mature European and American market is embracing more and more paid software providers .
which are becoming the most active and promising part of the entire software industry and economy .
that somehow proves that , seen from the perspective of the entire software development history , free software is only a choice made at a certain stage .
software products must find their way into a larger space in future where payment for them , or even continuous payment for their services , is needed .
I founded Won@@ der@@ share 15 years ago .
for 15 years we &apos;ve been using one thing to implement our business model : charging money for our products .
for 15 years we &apos;ve been sticking to one single strategy : going global .
frankly speaking , in the domestic market , Won@@ der@@ share is actually not known by many people .
but we have earned a very good , if not th@@ undering , name in the overseas market , especially in the consumer software market .
a lot of Won@@ der@@ share employees abroad often hear people around them say , &quot; I know Won@@ der@@ share .
I used it before ! &quot;
even the decoration workers , when they were renov@@ ating our office in North America , exclaimed , &quot; So you are Won@@ der@@ share .
I am using your product ! &quot;
some people may ask , paid software is gaining momentum in the overseas market , but what about in China ?
will it also prosper ?
here let &apos;s take a look at a chart from B@@ CG .
it forecasts that in the future five years .
Chinese consumption will increase by 55 % , sur@@ passing the growth rate of US &apos;s private consumption .
next let &apos;s see a chart that compares the IT spending between China and US .
China only spends 6 % of its GDP on software .
while US p@@ ours 32 % of its GDP into software for individual use .
so I firmly hold the view that , as the intellectual property right is being better protected in China .
it is increasingly hard for us to find or download pirated software , videos and music .
software services like online payment provided by Ali@@ pay and We@@ Chat are also hard to be pirated .
big trends like the combination of hardware and software are becoming a reality .
I believe , just as we are willing to pay for MP3 music or the membership of a video @-@ streaming website .
just as more and more people begin to pay for e @-@ books or digital games .
consumer software is sure to become the next me@@ ga@@ hit in the virtual goods consumption of China .
free products are only temporary .
the end of the path will be payment for software , because after all , the essence of business is the exchange of value .
when the software makes our life more and more convenient , becomes more and more indispensable for us .
when pirated editions are reduced by degrees , when we feel that more value is being created by the software .
we &apos;ll be sure to pay for it , for anyway all products and services must get remuneration from the market .
and I firmly believe that in the next 5 to 10 years , China will rise to become the world &apos;s largest market for paid software .
thank you .
