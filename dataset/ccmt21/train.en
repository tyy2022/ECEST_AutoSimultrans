but it was just like Ellen , he felt , to have rushed in bare@@ headed , carrying the boy in her arms , and to have dazz@@ led poor Mrs. Win@@ set@@ t into forgetting to ask who she was .
but he was beginning to fear his tendency to dwell on the things he disliked in her .
that would have been political suicide . but he saw anti @-@ Soviet slogans and hostile workers who refused to talk to the Russian visitors .
he had looked at the milling sheep with a sour expression , said , &quot; Some a these never went up there with you . &quot;
he &apos;d seen a Discovery Channel documentary in which a couple in similar stra@@ its had made snow@@ shoes out of their car seats .
yet he still looks more like the gifted young aide of 1997 than an omni@@ potent central banker .
but he seemed harmless enough . so there , in the steak house , my belly warm and full , I said yes .

however , it did not take long before they gathered themselves and politely cheered the foreign conqu@@ er@@ or .
but maybe a Pe@@ tr@@ i dish over@@ run with bacteria should make the list . because a new study shows that cigarettes are contaminated with a b@@ ev@@ y of nasty bugs , including some that cause disease .
however , they must be prepared for the above resolution to go into effect , for it is un@@ alter@@ able .
but here is what they &apos;re not telling you : the Great Bond C@@ aper is also an incredible tax dodge .

but , they say , there does seem to be a change in the air .
but they are still economists , with world@@ views that are still excessively individu@@ alistic and ration@@ alistic .

however they are such enormous projects that the suppliers have the Mo@@ D over a barrel , and what do you know ?
after all , they are about trying to persuade others of your opinion , based upon questionable research .
but they said even though China has yet to officially announce the meeting , they do expect the six @-@ party session to go forward as planned .
but they theor@@ ize that it may be because the chemicals disrupt thyroid hormones , which are critical to an infant &apos;s brain development .
but this is only motive : the gru@@ esome , fascinating mechanism of a crime against science - the methodological flaws - that &apos;s where the action is .
but they also shoot If so can be said that , on an estimated audience of this love , like with the Spring Festival G@@ ala .
however , they did analyse share price movements one hour each side of the 40 @-@ minute window and found share prices almost un@@ moved .
but nor are they eager to squ@@ ander more lives and money on a war that many voters think America has already lost .

but they should allow him to leave with as much dignity as he can salvage . resignation would be humiliation enough .
they were impolite to China , at least to Beijing . it &apos;s just like shaking hands with you with gloves on , which implied you are felt dirty .
but they are trying to lessen the damage by keeping the most vulnerable pilgri@@ ms away .
they will have at least three and a half more years , though , to gather good data on upper atmospheric dynamics .

yet he has the time to do these things with other senior managers .
but he also ru@@ ed the impact on his own reputation , saying that his name was now linked widely on the Internet with the rape allegation .
but his tenure was marked by domestic gri@@ d@@ lock , strained relations with China and the US , and a string of corruption scandals .
he said it was possible Myanmar was bar@@ tering uranium ore for conventional weapons , maybe even missile parts or technology .
but he sees empathy -- and the irrational acts of spending that spring from it -- as a trait to be cherished .
however , he characterized policy responses so far as &quot; reasonable &quot; and was still optimistic about his exposure to Indonesia and South Korea .
however , he argues , on the one hand the debate about these issues is unavoidable .
still , he argues that because of the regime &apos;s brutality , an armed struggle is now the only option .
still , he said the economy will eventually recover given its underlying strengths , and that the main uncertainty is the timing .

Mc@@ Mah@@ on . still , he said he has no way to know whether the storage tanks will become full soon , despite some &apos; un@@ confirmed reports &apos; they had .
but , he adds , &apos; we were going to be a lot more financially secure with her job than mine . &apos;
but he said the discussion shouldn &apos;t distract from the central issue of tackling Greece &apos;s fiscal problems .

he said , however , that the panel &apos;s request on Wednesday was forwarded to him by an Olym@@ pus executive , which , Mr. Wood@@ ford said , raised questions about the panel &apos;s independence .

yet he presented himself as the only person who would tus@@ s@@ le fiercely and relent@@ lessly enough to triumph .
still , he said the focus clearly remained on Western Europe , and , in particular , Italy because of that market &apos;s ability to define trends .
but he said it remains possible that the recently announced regulations could significantly affect companies like T@@ ud@@ ou .
but he seems to have tapped on the brake . he no longer talks about increasing the number of new markets the firm enters to 50 and beyond .
the most valuable thing he did , however , was champion the cause of that volatile and &quot; dangerous &quot; convert , Saul of Tar@@ sus .
&quot; but , &quot; he said of the Be@@ e@@ ha@@ us , &quot; we support anything that helps promote the honey@@ bee . &quot;

however he was clearly suffering from delu@@ sions and it seemed to me he was a particularly severe case of manic de@@ pressive .
he , though , clearly remains very fond of LL , asking after her well@@ being and wondering whether there was anything he could do for her .
but there was no time for him to think about it , because now he had Yuan Sha@@ o to fight .
&quot; still , he says with a laugh , &quot; it is better to be shocked at tight jeans than kill each other over mistrust .
but he chose a drastic method of st@@ aving off wrinkles , a pot@@ belly , the wh@@ ims of a fic@@ kle public .

but he warns this kind of local uprising will not last without strong backing from government officials .
however , he did not say whether NATO should be armed to overthrow Gaddafi and anti @-@ government personnel .
but he also acc@@ esses a more per@@ cus@@ sive language , prompting a thick and aggressive inter@@ play with the rhythm section .
the step was only a beginning , though , he said , with other key moves -- such as releasing all political prisoners and ceas@@ ing military campaigns against ethnic minorities -- as yet undone .

the breakthrough came when he te@@ amed up with Ste@@ p@@ toe , who was working on the then @-@ novel technique of lapar@@ oscopy ( key@@ hole surgery ) .
but here he was pledged to defend , on the part of his bet@@ ro@@ thed &apos;s cousin , conduct that , on his own wife &apos;s part , would justify him in calling down on her all the th@@ un@@ ders of Church and State .

she soon withdrew them , however , and retreated a few feet to rest against the window - s@@ ill .
but she ignored all that unimportant tri@@ via , because the Be@@ ast had a loving heart !
