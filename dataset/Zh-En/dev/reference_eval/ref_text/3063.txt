Everybody wants to make some changes in life, only that life is not so easy to be changed.
There is one fairly easy way you might count on though: through design.
The following pictures show a designer of our company.
He says his mom sees him as an artist and a good drawer.
In the eyes of his friends and clients, he is a maniac with crazy ideas.
Designers, according to the public, are more or less a group of eccentrics.
But what exactly are those designers like?
I've just said something about the designers.
Now perhaps, since we've known more about them, we could return to this question: what is design?
To define or explain the connotation of design sounds like a conundrum, so here I'd prefer to share with you some of what I call the great works of design.
The public always holds that designers create very fancy works.
Only those splendid works, such as a particular object or a car, or only the Italian designs, are thought to deserve the title "great".
That is not true.
Look around and watch closely, we will find in our life a lot of great designs.
Like this product here, whose global sales have far surpassed that of IPhone.
It's a core product of 3M, named "the Post-It note".
So could this be called a design? What is this? It is nothing so fancy, but it is a truly great design.
Then there is the zipper, invented during World War II.
It looks neither so fancy nor so cool, but it is essential to us.
Let's take a look at this one. It is a simple, square card, but it helps conduct financial, cash and bank settlement in a unified system.
All those are great designs in our life.
They are not necessarily created by a master, but could rather be the creation of any one of you.
Now let's take three minutes to make a simple design, a very small one. Let's design a toothbrush.
I want to do this because I'd like to tell you how designers work.
Now there are already so many kinds of toothbrushes on the market, how can we create a new toothbrush that is different from them?
First, we have to look from a different angle. In what aspect can our toothbrush be different?
To find where it could be different from others is the first step.
Second, we have to watch closely and notice the details.
Why does this toothbrush have pointed bristles, and that one, thicker bristles?
That means different functions and different demands from consumers.
We also need to think about technologies beyond the scope of toothbrush manufacturing, for example, is there any new material or new possibilities for our toothbrush?
And of course the trend is also our concern.
We'll study how people would like our design to go in future, and what they'd really want.
After studying so many resources and basics, we'll compare and find a possibility, which is not necessarily a toothbrush though.
Then we learn to translate this possibility into a tangible language, which might generate many sub-possibilities.
But not all of them can be successful in market.
We have to filter, layer by layer, through the consumers, the market and our clients. And finally there is the best one left.
Here I also want to introduce some designers to you.
Some of them perhaps you are quite familiar with.
Who is it? It is a designer. So is he.
This is a designer of music.
His name is John Lennon.
And Wright Brothers, who invented the airplane.
And Zhang Yimou, a designer of films.
This is our great chief designer, who designs our life.
This is a designer in science.
This is a designer in music.
And this is also a designer.
Designer is not a stereotyped occupation.
The only thing that matters is whether you can think different, take different perspectives and catch things that elude others.
Once I visited a friend in a German design company.
The first thing I saw in his office was a kayak suspended from the ceiling.
So I asked him for the reason.
They said because the most beautiful part of a boat was its bottom.
Designers must dare to look beneath the surface and see things others don't see.
That's the crucial keyâ€”thinking different.
Unfortunately, Chinese people are prey to the herd mentality.
If a girl wears a miniskirt, then it is quite possible that one or two days later her colleagues will wear a miniskirt too.
This herd mentality in consumption restrains our independent thinking.
There is another hindrance.
For over two thousand years China was governed by imperial powers, whose rule depended on uniformity.
In our company, there is a popular saying that goes, which goes, Chinese businessmen are all like Wu Dalang, a famous Chinese fictional dwarf.
They can't stand employees who are more capable than themselves. They will just lay you off if you stand out.
All the things above contribute to the media's grilling: why does China never have a Steve Jobs?
The reason is we dare not challenge the authority, the standards, or ourselves.
Challenging things should be the first step to be taken.
We must change ourselves if we want things to change in life.
Here I'd like to share with you how, as designers, we can change ourselves. There are three steps.
First, never yield to standards.
Second, try to break down the standards.
Third, try to create something new.
Those three steps are the trilogy that marks a good start for a designer.
Then what exactly is design?
Actually even till now I haven't yet figured out how to describe or define it.
Over twenty years of designing experience have taught me one thing: design is in fact a way of thinking and working.
The gist is to think from different angles.
So if we want to change our life and design our own destiny, we'd better learn to change ourselves first and invent a new way of thinking.
That's all I want to share with you today as a designer.
Thank you!
