Good evening, everyone.
I am no expert on extraterrestrial life, but I do study human life every day.
My work is about in vitro fertilization or artificial fertilization.
Everyone in this room today may have heard of IVF, but I don't think many of you can tell exactly what IVF is, and some of you may even have some misunderstandings.
Well, a few years ago, one of my patients asked me after her eggs were taken, "Doctor Kuang, when can I come back to take my baby?"
She overestimated me.
And she thought I could make in a test tube a real baby that could laugh and cry.
In fact, the technology is far less developed than she thought.
What we can do today is IVF and embryo transfer.
We use merely two materials to create life.
What we do is inject sperms into eggs, which sounds simpler than cooking.
The egg looks as big as a pancake, but it's actually very tiny with a diameter of about only 140 micrometers.
How wide is 140 micrometers?
Merely 0.14 millimeters.
Sperms are even smaller, each at three to five microns across.
Therefore, all our work are done under microscopes.
The union of an egg and sperm would produce a fertilized egg.
A human fertilized egg.
Biologically, the moment of fertilization implies the true union of a man and a woman.
The combination of their gene witnesses their love and gives birth to their children.
Once the genetic material of a man and a woman is united and fertilized, a new life is born and grows in acccordance with a set of procedures.
The fertilization is like a start button, from the moment it is pressed, a life begins following a natural course.
Having been doing my work for 17 years, whenever I see embryo changes and grows day by day, I still feel amazed at the wonder of life.
Given the current technology, however, blastocysts can only be cultured in vitro and then transferred into the uterus, otherwise the embryo will die.
Once the embryo is successfully planted in the uterus and everything in place, the embryo will start to grow and eventually becomes a cute baby after a ten-month pregnancy, just like every other natural pregnancies.
In this sense, actually our involvement is rather brief.
We just need to work in the first five to seven days before the pregnancy begins.
After that, all happens in the uterus, which is a normal and natural process.
Now, when we talk about this, the IVF and the embryo transfer sound easy, but it is in practice rather complicated, since they are typically considered as high technologies.
For some may suffer repeated embryo transfer fails.
Some fail because of their advanced maternal age, of certain uterine damage, of infertility or other complex factors.
All these will result in repeated transfer failures.
Doctors would offer two options for patients in such situations.
Option one, I will tell them,"The success rate of your transfer is too low, maybe you should leave it."
But can their problems be solved after we send them home?
No, they still are in pain.
Meanwhile, we fail as a doctor and there are regrets.
Therefore, as doctors, we never choose this option easily nor give up on a patient.
Sometimes, my patients will ask me, "Is this going to work, Doctor Kuang?"
I will tell them that I have no idea because I'm not a fortune teller.
On top of that, my confidence is built on yours, since we are in this together and we can boost each other's confidence.
Then she said, "Thanks for your reassurance. I'll keep doing it."
So giving up is never an option for us.
Vitrification, a new technology we have been developing from 2006, is much better than the traditional freezing technology, providing a higher survival rate for thawed embryos.
Then we initiated the study of natural cycle and microstimulation technology.
The advancement of this technology led us to think differently, and blazed a new way of thinking which focuses on embryo freezing.
To put it in another way, it means that we freeze the embryo after obtaining it, instead of transferring immediately.
These jars are used for storing embryos.
In our lab there are dozens of jars filled with thousands of embryos, all of which are precious lives.
Now, the fresh transfer is replaced by the frozen embryo transfer.
Thanks to this new way of thinking, this patient successfully conceived after her 13th embryo transfer in 2009, and gave birth to a healthy boy in May 2010 with c-section.
A few days ago, she messaged me, saying that her son is handsome, smart, and is turning two years old. She is so happy and plans to visit me in Shanghai with her son.
From this example, we can learn that it is love that keeps her going.
If we give birth to a new life for money, but not for love, just as surrogate mothers do, then that is a different matter.
We know that pregnancy doesn't always go well.
Most of the women here today may have experienced vomiting during pregnancy and sometimes even severe vomiting.
Can you imagine how serious the case of one of my patient?
She was vomitting blood, yet she refused to take any medicin.
I finally managed to persuade her into taking it and she agreed.
If she was a surrogate mother, could she endure such pain?
I don’t think so.
Today’s pregnant women will quickly warp themselves in radiation-proof clothing, indicating that they are expecting.
They also place great care in what they eat and use, and even stay away from iPads and smart phones to avoid radiation.
All these carefulness show their care and protection for their baby.
Will surrogates be like this?
Will they quit smoking?
Stop drinking?
Or stop using drugs?
Will they change their ways of thinking and acting?
I don't think so.
What surrogacy brings are not only theses problems, but other hidden dangers.
This is a surrogacy scandal in Guangzhou, China. A couple hired two surrogate mothers to give birth to eight babies simultaneously.
It is a scandal because it is impossible for any legitimate hospital to transfer so many embryos at one time.
The hospital in this case transplanted three blastocysts to each surrogate mother at the same time.
To ensure a high success rate, blastocyst is generally transferred one by one, two at most.
Three means a pretty high premature birth rate.
It is obviously that such kind of surrogacy is undertook by illegal underground agencies, which conduct non-standard and illegal medical practice.
Therefore, it is hard to foresee the long-term impact on future generations.
So, of course, surrogacy is also getting entangled with sociological issues.
Let's try to picture this in our mind, for the sake of money, there are so many women who are willing to give birth to a baby for other women.
What drives them into doing this?
Poverty.
Then the poor would likely to be a fertility tool for the rich if surrogacy is no longer under supervision, which will undoubtedly cause new social inequality.
For this reason, surrogacy is prohibited and not allowed in our country.
Therefore, if an expectant mother gives birth to a new life for something other than love, the issues that may harm the society and the new life will emerge one after another.
Only when love is the reason that the conceiving of life is natural and the life could receive better care.
So, when there is love, there can be new life.
Thank you all.
