Good Evening, everyone.
I don't know if you know this person.
He is a very famous speaker in Australia, Nick.
He has no limbs, and he likes to tease his only little leg very much.
He calls it drumstick.
In fact, it is very difficult for us to imagine or understand how he lives.
First thought that came to me was how could he manage to survive?
How can he live with such a very good and optimistic state of mind and state of life?
It turns out he is living very well now.
He is making speeches everywhere.
He not only recognizes and believes in himself, he also brings his confidence to everyone who listens to his speeches.
Many people were moved and cried when they heard what he said, and finally they would look back at themselves: Am I saying yes to myself?
Am I confident in myself?
Even a disabled person with no limbs like him, though physically handicapped, still has such a perfect character and perfect spirit.
So what should we do?
What kind of affirmation should we have for ourselves?
I especially admire a disabled athlete when I was an athlete.
I used to be a wheelchair fencer.
Once I met an American boy in a contest who was in a wheelchair, too, his grade was B.
The so-called Class A and Class B refer to two grades for athlete's conditions in wheelchair fencing.
Grade A are those like me, with a functional lumbar spine that can move back and forth, because wheelchair fencing is fixed.
So what is Grade B?
Grade B are those with lumbar paralysis who have no senses below the waist.
But this athlete of Grade B has very, very serious conditions among the Grade B fencers I have seen.
Why?
Except for his lumbar paralysis, he even loses the three fingers of his hand holding the sword.
Do you know how he held the sword?
He managed to sit in the wheelchair for competiton with the help of others.
After he sat in the wheelchair, he had his hand to hold the sword tied to his own hand bandages on a glove, and then he would stab the other side very hard.
However, I can always see him in every World Cup and championship.
He has always been ranked among the last, so to speak, the last in those games.
What kind of spirit supported him to take part in the competition all the time?
You know, everyone is afraid of losing, right?
Everyone does not want to lose; rather, they all want to win.
When he lost every match or even came in the second last or last place, what was it or what kind of strength supported him to compete and train all the time?
Later it occurred to me that he must like this sport.
He loves this sport.
So he enjoys it even if he loses.
It is the kind of person who makes me feel I can do everything.
With that, what is the limit of human beings?
Many of our functions have deteriorated, but in fact, human beings are the animals that can adapt to the environment best.
Why?
Although I have one leg, I have never thought I would have any problem surviving in this society since I just have my leg amputated.
I think that I can survive no matter what.
My job may not be particularly good, but I think I can find a job, which is my reason of confidence.
Many people say that I am not able to do it.
In fact, it's not that you can't do it.
Not really.
It's just that you haven't come to the moment.
To survive in this environment, one can always find various ways to adapt oneself to it.
Then when you have one leg, you must survive as always, so I learned to jump when I just started to be one-leg.
Later, when I got my crutch for the first time, I said to myself in the mind: "Wow! This pair of crutches feels just like the crutches I should have been born with. How can I walk so freely?"
Until now, many people still ask me, "Jin Jing, why don't you put on artificial limbs?"
"How beautiful your legs look with artificial limbs," They would say.
Why don't I use artificial limbs?
First, I can't wear high-heeled shoes when wearing artificial limbs.
I still like wearing them.
Girls look very tall and straight when wearing high-heels.
Second, wearing artificial limbs is really not as convenient as people think.
I am a practical type.
I wouldn't force myself into a beautiful look, which turns out to affect my normal life.
So why do I need a prosthetic leg?
Just to be good-looking?
In the eyes of other people?
I would say I am also pretty good-looking this way, what do you say?
So sometimes I think it is very, very important for me to affirm myself and be confident in myself.
By the terms used by athletes, the process of torch relay is like a process from individual competition to team competition.
Because when I came down from the coach for torch carriers, I found that many people around me were hostile,  unfriendly protesters who even tried to grab the torch from me.
At that time, I thought, oh, why would they be like this?
Why would such a thing happen?
Out of an athlete's instinct, I would feel so angry, because it happened to be the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Olympics in our own country.
Later, it wan't until later when our Chinese overseas students come to join this team that I found: Wow, actually I am not alone.
It turns out I have such a huge force behind me.
If you are really sure about yourself, about all the decisions you have made, or the things you have done, then on what ground will you refuse to believe in our people, in us, and in our country's future destined to be better?
We really, really hope that besides giving a little confidence, a little recognition to ourselves and all our close friends, our country, our motherland can also give more people a little recognition and a little confidence.
Thank you.
Hello, everyone!
Welcome to the advanced course on the UNIT dialogue system.
I'm Sun Shuqi, an R&D engineer for UNIT.
In this lesson, we will learn how to evaluate the performance of a dialogue system.
Performance evaluations mainly serve two purposes.
Let's look at the first one, online performance tracking.
For online performance tracking, we first need to extract some business logs regularly, then evaluate its precision and recall manually.
How do we extract the logs?
We must emphasize not to delete the duplicate samples in the actual online logs.
This is very important, because the duplicate samples will reflect the actual distribution of problems.
The sample size should be between 100 and 200.
We can then create an evaluation set in which we will calculate two indexes: precision and recall.
Some developers may be confused when they first see these two indexes, wondering how to calculate them.
To make it easier to understand, I have made a diagram here.
The orange circle represents the queries that have been parsed successfully by the system, and the blue circle represents those queries which we expect to be parsed successfully.
The B circle is where they intersect, representing the queries that have been parsed successfully and accurately by the system.
So, the precision formula is caculated by B÷(A+B), which shows the ratio of accurately-identified queries to all those identified by the system.
This is what precision refers to.
B÷(B+C) is dividing the number of accurately identified queries by the number of those expected to be identified.
This is what recall refers to.
In addition to these two indexes, we also need to pay attention to some key and specific cases.
For example, if the intents are parsed unsuccessfully or inaccurately, and the slots are not identified, it could be because some utterances that we did not prepared during the configuration phase have been encountered, or because slot values which are not covered in the system dictionary and custom dictionary have appeared.
This is how we should address this kind of situation -  add new templates and label some samples, supplement the custom dictionary with the missing slot values.
In the second case, when slots are not accurately identified or normalized, it is likely that there are bad cases in the system slot dictionary, or that some entries in the user slot dictionary have multiple possible meanings, or that the user slot dictionary covers all entries of the system one.
The solution is to submit feedback to UNIT and urge us to develop and update the system slot dictionary.
Users can also adjust their templates and dictionaries on their own.
One tip - a small number of cases can be resolved just by labeling samples.
The third one is that some new requests cannot be met.
For example, in a map scenario, we have often found that people not only ask for directions and locations, but also ask for music to be played.
This is actually very interesting.
We would have to analyze whether this new request should be supported or not.
If so, then we would need to add new skills.
Otherwise, we need to guide the users by telling them that this function is not supported.
In doing so, lower their expectations.
In short, regular evaluations are very important.
We need to quickly discover problems and new requests so as to keep improving the performance of the dialogue system.
The second one is policy iteration.
What is policy iteration?
At first, we have a model X.
Then, we optimize the model and change it to a new model, Y.
What should we do before we replace the online model X with Y?
At this time, we can use the evaluation method I just mentioned, that is, we evaluate the precision and recall.
If Y scores higher than X on precision and recall, then Y is indeed better.
But is this enough?
I don't think so.
We also need to perform some comparative evaluations to see the diff ratio and GSB.
Let's look at what diff ratio and GSB are.
To evaluate on these two indexes, we first need to create a data set, that is, we first use two models, X and Y,  to parse the same data log and see if they generate different results with regard to the same query.
If they do, we will collect the results and create an observation set.
Then, to get diff ratio, we can divide the size of the observation set by that of the log.
In fact, diff ratio essentially reflects the percentage of queries for which the two models generate different results.
It is very important, because it represents the degree of change in user experience when Y is released.
By observing all the different results we can see whether Y is better than X or vice versa for each individual query, or whether they perform similarly despite having different results.
Every case is rated in three levels: good, same and bad.
G: S: B refers to the ratio of "good" cases to "same" cases to "bad" cases.
In this way, the result is very clear.
For Y to replace X, there should be more G cases than B cases.
This is the only way to prove that Y is better than X.
We should also take note if the diff ratio is too high.
As a rule of thumb, if the diff ratio is higher than 10%, then things become tricky, because it entails a relatively significant change in user experience.
We need to consider whether this significant change in user experience needs to be addressed.
OK, that's all for this lesson.
Thank you!
Good evening, everyone.
I am Liao Zile from Shanghai World Foreign Language Academy.
My grades are neither poor nor good, and I'm definitely not a well-behaved kid in the traditional sense.
But I have a special hobby: fiddling with robots.
So my friends like to call me "Mac the Robot".
Since my 3rd year in primary school I've been touring around with my coach, as well as my robot friends, through all kinds of robot competitions across the world and have won some prizes.
Last year, I won the second prize in the World Educational Robot Contest hosted by Trinity College.
This year, I won another second prize in the World Educational Robot Contest staged in US.
Always the second prize. Maybe that word "two" just loves me ("Two" also means "silly" in Chinese).
You might at first take me as a cute, good and polite boy.
Indeed, if you stay with me for five minutes, there is a good chance that you might exclaim, "What a good boy!"
If the five minutes extend to five hours, I bet your previous good opinion of me will be overthrown.
"This boy is a nuisance", you might say.
If the time you spend with me is further lengthened to five days, I'm sure you will finally conclude, "well, this is actually a problem kid."
Alas, why is it so?
Because I don't quite listen to what adults say.
Precisely speaking, I listen to them 65% of the time.
The other 35% of the time I just follow my own ideas.
But you adults obviously don't like that.
That means I always live a miserable life.
Being scolded has become such a routine for me that it seems as if the day never dawns nor darkens without me being reprimanded.
The most frequent advice for me is, "Can you just listen to me?"
But the problem is, I do listen.
Only that I listen selectively, and I keep my independence 35% of the time.
Since my 3rd year in primary school I've been thinking, "Must I fully yield to adults?
Can I at least have some say in my own life?
As my contemplation deepens, I come to realize that adults have their own world, and children should also construct a world that belongs only to them.
I've also found something disturbing in adults along the way.
Here I'll give you some examples.
The first thing is, I find adults, like running wheels, tend to put endless demands on children.
Take me for example.
When I was in 5th grade in primary school, my dad repeatedly warned me, "You must get the direct, exam-exempted access to the junior high school. Or else you will be doomed."
So I kept working hard, until finally I secured a place at the junior high school in the second semester of the 5th grade.
Time to relax, I told myself.
But my dad posed yet another challenge, "You must also get a place in the elite class of the junior high school, or else you still have little chance to win."
Poor me.
I had to start yet another round of tough study.
My labor was rewarded and finally I was given a place in the elite class.
My dad, however, was still not satisfied.
School began, and I scampered around to pack up my things.
Then my dad said, "You have to make it into the top 15 of the class. It should not be so hard. I believe you can do that."
But dad, you should know that the elite class usually gathers the best of the best students.
How can I have a chance to squeeze into the top 15?
I can imagine that, when I graduate from the junior high school, my dad will definitely say to me, "You must get into the top four high schools."
After that, when I end my high school life, he will again push me, "You must go to the top-rated universities."
Things are just like that. You adults are always putting demands on children, and there is no end to your demands.
As far as I know, such things also happen to my classmates.
Those hopes of yours, I should say, are actually your own unfulfilled dreams that you impose upon us.
But I think we children should also have our own dreams.
The second thing I've found is that you adults seem very reluctant to admit your own mistakes.
You agree with me on this?
I used to be a frequent visitor at the Xinhua Bookstore, reading or buying books there, when I was in 5th grade of primary school.
I still remember two scenes I saw there.
In the first scene, a mother, after feeding water to her child from a cup, put the cup on the ground, but the lid wasn't fastened tightly on the cup.
When the child turned around to pick books, he accidentally trod on and kicked over the cup.
So what would you do if you were this mother?
I bet you would be furious and give the child a good scolding.
And so the mother did.
But I just want to say, would this accident still have happened if the lid of the cup had been firmly fastened in the first place?
The second scene was about a father who led his child to pick books.
The child drank some water from a cup, and again, leaving the cup loosely covered.
Then the cup was kicked over by the father by accident.
And the father, again, like the mother in the first scene, showered the child with scolding.
"Why didn't you screw the lid tight?" he snapped, "If you had done that, nothing would have happened."
Well, now this, now that, I just don't understand, why is everything the children's fault?
The third thing I notice is that adults are strict with children, but are lenient with themselves.
For example, playing digital games is what we children naturally like, but adults, either teachers or parents, keep saying that digital games are bad, will disrupt study and lead to poor grades.
So we are only permitted to use digital products without any gaming functions.
Even the electronic dictionary we use is stripped of all games, however unthreatening they are, like Snake, so as to make sure the dictionary is safe.
But just look around, there are adults everywhere with eyes glued to their cell phone, whether at dinner, or during a meeting, or on the subway, or driving a car.
I can even see from here that some of you are using your cell phone right now.
The irrefutable reason adults give us for all this injustice is: because we are adults, we can use cell phones.
And because you are children, you just can't.
What a logic!
The fourth thing I find is that adults sometimes are even slower to forgive than children.
For example, a naughty boy like me might easily invite scolding, and sometimes I might have issues with my classmates.
But generally no matter whether I am unfairly treated, I just learn to endure.
Sometimes unhappy things happen between me and my friends, but we soon make up.
The worst enemy fighting me in the morning can become my intimate buddy again in the afternoon.
But look at you adults, how often you hold a lifelong grudge!
And you even fabricate a phrase for your act: it is never too late for revenge.
So I am thinking, if one day we have to grow into adults like you who always let unhappy things weigh on the mind, then what's the point of our growing up?
It is because of those things I've found about you adults that I choose to keep your advice at arm's length.
I believe, 65% of the time, what you say is absolutely right and I must accept it for my own good.
But for the other 35% of the time, I want to be my own master.
With the 35%, I will have my own world, and with the 65% I can stand on the shoulders of  giants before me.
I can achieve more and have my own future.
Thank you!
Developers, entrepreneurs and friends, good afternoon!
It is an honor for me to welcome all of you to attend the ceremony!
Today is the last day of our 2017 Baidu AI Developer Camp, and the openning day of our Baidu AI Accelerator.
We all know that AI is now very popular, but what does AI mean to us actually?
All of us know this saying, "Science and technology constitute a primary productive force."
Over the past 200 years, mankind has already gone through three industrial revolutions, each of which has greatly increased the productivity through injecting the power of technology into every aspect of our production and daily life.
Now we are undergoing the fourth industrial revolution.
So what is the key technology this time?
Artificial intelligence, of course.
AI will not only improve the efficiency of existing industries, but also bring about a lot of new products and new industries.
In this process, although this time the booming of AI is largely due to the Internet industry that possesses an enormous amount of data, very strong computing capability and computational platforms, and many advanced algorithms.
But the impact of AI is far beyond the Internet.
It will definitely affect all kinds of industries and the life of people in all aspects, bringing productivity increase.
And productivity increase, in return, will eventually affect the production relations.
Most of us might have learned this when we were in school.
Economic base will eventually determine our superstructure.
In other words, along with its growth, little by little, AI will bring  profound impacts on everyone of us and on the whole society.
Baidu started search engine service nearly 18 years ago.
At the beginning, we would say search engine is naturally an AI product,  so from the very beginning of our search engine development, Baidu has been working on some AI technologies, for example, NLP technologies.
And seven or eight years ago, Baidu started setting a full layout for AI.
For example, NLP, speech, image, machine learning, knowledge graph, big data and etc. were started in Baidu at that time.
Now we have got a rather complete layout, from the most basic layer to the perception layer, which covers speech, image, vision, video, AR, VR，to the cognition level, including NLP, KG and user portrait.
More importantly, based on these technologies, we have established a complete platform and ecosystem, which are closely related to every developer and entrepreneur here.
As the host mentioned just now, since October our Baidu AI Developer Camp has been held in many cities.
Today it returns to Beijing and comes to an end.
Of course, its end in this year does not mean it is over.
I believe that more and more developers will achieve their success in our camp next year.
In addition to the Camp, in addition to the AI capacities we offered to AI-related developers and entrepreneurs, we also hope we could provide comprehensive support, in terms of partnerships, market channels and funds.
That's why we have this AI Accelerator that opens today.
We expect that our Practice Camp can help the participants to improve their business skills through practices and exercises, and we wish that our AI Accelerator could provide a much more comprehensive support for all of you.
Before I left the company for the conference, I got an e-mail.
Many of you may know that we held the 2017 Baidu World Conference on November 16th, opening many new capabilities such as AR.
Now, half a month has passed.
The e-mail forwarded by a colleague of mine, said that after the opening of the capabilities, a developer soon has published his self-developed product based on these capabilities.
During the period from November 16th to today, the product has been sold in market and won orders.
And this is just one example I've heard.
I believe that some of you here may have similar experience.
I hope that Baidu can provide more support for you and we will succeed together!
The success of all developers and partners is the success of Baidu AI, and also the success of Baidu.
Let us contribute our share to achieve a better future for our society and our life!
Thank you!
Hello everyone!
Welcome to the advanced course on the UNIT dialogue system.
I am Sun Shuqi, an R&D engineer for the Baidu UNIT platform.
In this course, I will introduce to you the UNIT dialogue management.
Dialogue management is aimed at dealing with businesses or things that cannot be fully said or done in one sentence.
There are three major tasks in dialogue management.
Firstly, the information mentioned in previous sessions have to be remembered.
Secondly, the missing key information have to be clarified.
Thirdly, specific dialogue branches should be triggered in different situations.
Let's refer to a few cases to understand how these dialogue management tasks are performed.
For example, in the dialogue shown on the left, the user wants to reserve a room, the bot asks how long he intends to stay, and the user says "till next Monday", to which the bot says "OK".
The user then changes his mind and says, "please make it till next Tuesday", and the bot says "OK".
What happened during this dialogue?
Firstly, there was an interpretation of intents and slots, naturally.
For example, the intent was identified as room reservation, the merchant as Beijing Hotel, and the check-in date as September 14.
During the second turn of dialogue, the user updated a slot by adding the check-out date, which was September 17.
The previous two slots and the intent were inherited.
This is the function of remembering and updating historical information.
And the slot can also be overwritten.
For example, when the user spoke the third sentence, the check-out date was updated to September 18.
That is the function of overwriting information.
In general, that is how the memory and update mechanism of UNIT works.
In the second case, let's take a look at the clarification function.
This is a slot-filling task.
Let's first look at the dialogue on the left.
"I want to reserve a room and stay for three days", says the user.
The bot asks, "What is the check-in date?"
"Next Monday."
Then the bot asks, "When would you like to check out?"
The user becomes unhappy here.
I've already said I want to stay for three days from next Monday, why ask again?
Shouldn't you be asking me where I want to stay?
Why is this happening?
It is related to the slot-filling logic of UNIT.
When some configurations are unsatisfactory, some dialogues as weird as that on the left will result.
Let's take a look at the slot-filling logic of UNIT first.
After UNIT identifies the intents and slots naturally, what will it do?
It will check the schema of the intents and slots to see whether the trigger conditions are met or not.
If not met, it will make some clarifications as in the dialogue on the left.
But the clarifications are made in a certain order.
What is the order?
The clarifications are made in the order that the slots were defined .
When the configuration is unsatisfactory, for example, the order of defining slots becomes check-in date, check-out date, number of nights, and hotel name.
If the check-out date is missing here, UNIT will clarify the check-out date instead of the hotel name first, which can be troublesome.
To avoid such unsatisfactory configurations, there are two solutions.
The first is to reorder the slots, putting the hotel name at the very front so that it will be clarified first.
This can solve the problem.
The second option is to split the intent, that is, to split the intent of reserving a room into two.
One is to reserve a room based on number of nights, and the other one is to reserve a room based on the check-out date.
This may be a better solution.
For example, when reserving a room based on number of nights, the slots are hotel name, check-in date, and number of nights; when reserving a room based on the check-out date, the slots are hotel name, check-in date, and check-out date.
In this way, the weird question in the above dialogue can be avoided.
OK, let's take a look at the third case on how to deal with if-else dialogue logic.
The dialogue in the third case is about increasing credit limit.
When the user requests to increase their credit limit, it is necessary to assess their qualifications.
This is the third task of dialogue management as we mentioned just now, and that is to trigger dialogue logics in specific situations.
The bot judges the users to be qualified.
Then, what will it say?
"OK, your credit limit can be increased up to 50,000 yuan. What amount would you like to increase it to?"
This is the general logic.
To establish if-else dialogue logics, I suggest using the DM Kit introduced below.
DM Kit is a local dialogue management module which can run within the developer's own machine environment and integrate seamlessly with our UNIT cloud.
Because it is a local module, it allows you to write codes to perform some complex multi-state processes.
In addition, it also supports databases and Web Hook mechanisms, and can access some external resources.
For example, in the above case, the information that the user can increase their credit card limit to 50,000 yuan must have been acquired by querying the business base.
DM Kit can provide good support for this.
Finally, since it is an open source module, we can flexibly develop and extend it.
To find out more about DM Kit, you can visit the GitHub website through the link below.
OK.
That's all for this lesson.
Thanks！
Good afternoon, everyone.
Three apples have changed the world.
The first one helped Adam discover that he is pant-less.
The second apple brought Newton to Universal Gravitation.
The third Apple let us know that everyone deserves a smartphone.
And my apple, in this sense, is this picture, which was taken around 70 years ago.
The two people in the picture split away after they took the picture.
What's interesting about this picture is that both wore the same type of suit named as Zhongshan Suit.
The Zhongshan suit was introduced by Sun Yat-sen.
It actually contains much information.
For instance, it has five buttons that represent separation of five powers.
What about the four pockets?
They stand for the four foundations of a nation.
Courtesy, righteousness, honesty and sense of shame.
There are three buttons on the right sleeve, representing the tenet - "of the people, by the people and for the people".
And three on the left, standing for equality, freedom and fraternity of mankind.
Well, from the perspective of computers, they have basically the same interface, is that right?
But we all know deep down inside, their kernels are different.
Or to put it this way: one group of people followed the Three Principles of People and Christianity and another pursued the Marxism-Leninism.
They are just like two “operating systems” battling against each other.
In the end, the one on the left went somewhere else.
And that place is called Taiwan, which has witnessed rapid development over the years.
Over the course of last 70 years, Chinese Mainland and Taiwan have experienced drastic changes that are quite different from each other.
We all can feel that.
We can compare from various aspects such as economy, culture and many others.
But why would there be such huge differences?
For instance, in the mobile internet industry, we have the iOS operating system and Android system, an ecosystem created by Google.
Microsoft is doing the similar thing, aspiring to remake itself as one of the mobile internet giants.
You see, all competition is after all the competition of operating systems.
So when we see the world via this operating system, the society, shouldn't we also be thinking through a social operating system?
Or in the case of the mobile internet, do you understand what's competing here?
It is actually a competition between different operating systems.
That's the reason why Google, founder of Android, took a strong stance lately, quite surprisingly, forbidding Acer to release phones that have installed Alibaba's operating system.
So now you have a sense of the importance of differences in operating systems.
But what is it like in the light of society?
In fact, civilization is what's defined as operating system in the social context.
Here in the chart, there are four levels and seven modules that can match one another.
For example, our heart is like hardware with a CPU.
So how do we drive our body, so to speak?
Of course sex drives our body.
Anything else that you see?
There is a kernel, which is the way we see the world, that drives our body.
Right?
Over it, there are our values and prospects of life.
So accordingly, there are many other virtual machines or parts built above the operating system, something we normally refer to as basic service.
Another important thing is language which I've marked in another color.
This language is what we use to communicate, just like the one we use to communicate with people.
Above that we can create our own applications, right?
We have different applications inside the iOS or Android system, regarding many aspects of our life, such as clothes, food, housing, travel, medicines and elderly care, and even corporates, laws and institutions.
Everything can find its counterpart in the past.
We live in this operating system, just like our phones.
So do we have room for multiple operating systems in a large system?
Does it work that way?
So how do we do it?
We might try to build our own operating system using this way.
Four levels, seven modules.
You can replace the modules as you want.
You all hear me.
For example, what is sex?
The desire for food and sex is part of human nature.
What is our core operating system?
It's about changes.
The Chinese classic, Book of Changes, touches upon lots of changes.
Going beyond it, we have our Five Constant Virtues adn our propaganda slogan.
What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.
Going beyond, we have our social framework.
What is it then?
Family.
Family is the foundation on which our nation and society are constructed.
And over it is our language.
This social operating system is quite simple, actually, perhaps the simplest one in the world among all the other operating systems.
This system was developed almost 2500 years ago.
Who developed it?
Confucius.
Who were on his team?
Ten core CXOs, or the so-called Ten Philosophers: including Zilu, Zigong, Zengshen and etc.
And who else?
Other 72 "Project Managers" who he deemed also as good performers as well as the other 3000 disciples as his programmers.
Right?
How many years did they take to develop such a system?
Almost 14 years during which they paid visits to 10 countries.
What was he doing then?
To promote his system.
And it had good results.
At least the system he created is still alive after 2000 years.
What's gone are applications built on the system, like the Qing Dynasty, Yuan Dynasty, Song Dynasty.
The applications have come and gone but never the structure of the system, right?
You see that the very meaning of the system, including its courtesy and the idea of family, stays.
This understanding reminds us of the fact that we do have something.
If you do it all over again, you can spot other operating systems, including the western civilization based on Socrates' philosophy, or Islam by Muhammad, whose influences are in fact overshadowed by ours.
So why on earth did we abandon our operating system?
So what are we waiting for?
I think from my perspective, from our perspective, it is about time.
For what?
Let's open our heart and reinstall our operating system.
Thank you!
Good evening, everyone.
I am no expert on extraterrestrial life, but I do study human life every day.
My work is about in vitro fertilization or artificial fertilization.
Everyone in this room today may have heard of IVF, but I don't think many of you can tell exactly what IVF is, and some of you may even have some misunderstandings.
Well, a few years ago, one of my patients asked me after her eggs were taken, "Doctor Kuang, when can I come back to take my baby?"
She overestimated me.
And she thought I could make in a test tube a real baby that could laugh and cry.
In fact, the technology is far less developed than she thought.
What we can do today is IVF and embryo transfer.
We use merely two materials to create life.
What we do is inject sperms into eggs, which sounds simpler than cooking.
The egg looks as big as a pancake, but it's actually very tiny with a diameter of about only 140 micrometers.
How wide is 140 micrometers?
Merely 0.14 millimeters.
Sperms are even smaller, each at three to five microns across.
Therefore, all our work are done under microscopes.
The union of an egg and sperm would produce a fertilized egg.
A human fertilized egg.
Biologically, the moment of fertilization implies the true union of a man and a woman.
The combination of their gene witnesses their love and gives birth to their children.
Once the genetic material of a man and a woman is united and fertilized, a new life is born and grows in acccordance with a set of procedures.
The fertilization is like a start button, from the moment it is pressed, a life begins following a natural course.
Having been doing my work for 17 years, whenever I see embryo changes and grows day by day, I still feel amazed at the wonder of life.
Given the current technology, however, blastocysts can only be cultured in vitro and then transferred into the uterus, otherwise the embryo will die.
Once the embryo is successfully planted in the uterus and everything in place, the embryo will start to grow and eventually becomes a cute baby after a ten-month pregnancy, just like every other natural pregnancies.
In this sense, actually our involvement is rather brief.
We just need to work in the first five to seven days before the pregnancy begins.
After that, all happens in the uterus, which is a normal and natural process.
Now, when we talk about this, the IVF and the embryo transfer sound easy, but it is in practice rather complicated, since they are typically considered as high technologies.
For some may suffer repeated embryo transfer fails.
Some fail because of their advanced maternal age, of certain uterine damage, of infertility or other complex factors.
All these will result in repeated transfer failures.
Doctors would offer two options for patients in such situations.
Option one, I will tell them,"The success rate of your transfer is too low, maybe you should leave it."
But can their problems be solved after we send them home?
No, they still are in pain.
Meanwhile, we fail as a doctor and there are regrets.
Therefore, as doctors, we never choose this option easily nor give up on a patient.
Sometimes, my patients will ask me, "Is this going to work, Doctor Kuang?"
I will tell them that I have no idea because I'm not a fortune teller.
On top of that, my confidence is built on yours, since we are in this together and we can boost each other's confidence.
Then she said, "Thanks for your reassurance. I'll keep doing it."
So giving up is never an option for us.
Vitrification, a new technology we have been developing from 2006, is much better than the traditional freezing technology, providing a higher survival rate for thawed embryos.
Then we initiated the study of natural cycle and microstimulation technology.
The advancement of this technology led us to think differently, and blazed a new way of thinking which focuses on embryo freezing.
To put it in another way, it means that we freeze the embryo after obtaining it, instead of transferring immediately.
These jars are used for storing embryos.
In our lab there are dozens of jars filled with thousands of embryos, all of which are precious lives.
Now, the fresh transfer is replaced by the frozen embryo transfer.
Thanks to this new way of thinking, this patient successfully conceived after her 13th embryo transfer in 2009, and gave birth to a healthy boy in May 2010 with c-section.
A few days ago, she messaged me, saying that her son is handsome, smart, and is turning two years old. She is so happy and plans to visit me in Shanghai with her son.
From this example, we can learn that it is love that keeps her going.
If we give birth to a new life for money, but not for love, just as surrogate mothers do, then that is a different matter.
We know that pregnancy doesn't always go well.
Most of the women here today may have experienced vomiting during pregnancy and sometimes even severe vomiting.
Can you imagine how serious the case of one of my patient?
She was vomitting blood, yet she refused to take any medicin.
I finally managed to persuade her into taking it and she agreed.
If she was a surrogate mother, could she endure such pain?
I don’t think so.
Today’s pregnant women will quickly warp themselves in radiation-proof clothing, indicating that they are expecting.
They also place great care in what they eat and use, and even stay away from iPads and smart phones to avoid radiation.
All these carefulness show their care and protection for their baby.
Will surrogates be like this?
Will they quit smoking?
Stop drinking?
Or stop using drugs?
Will they change their ways of thinking and acting?
I don't think so.
What surrogacy brings are not only theses problems, but other hidden dangers.
This is a surrogacy scandal in Guangzhou, China. A couple hired two surrogate mothers to give birth to eight babies simultaneously.
It is a scandal because it is impossible for any legitimate hospital to transfer so many embryos at one time.
The hospital in this case transplanted three blastocysts to each surrogate mother at the same time.
To ensure a high success rate, blastocyst is generally transferred one by one, two at most.
Three means a pretty high premature birth rate.
It is obviously that such kind of surrogacy is undertook by illegal underground agencies, which conduct non-standard and illegal medical practice.
Therefore, it is hard to foresee the long-term impact on future generations.
So, of course, surrogacy is also getting entangled with sociological issues.
Let's try to picture this in our mind, for the sake of money, there are so many women who are willing to give birth to a baby for other women.
What drives them into doing this?
Poverty.
Then the poor would likely to be a fertility tool for the rich if surrogacy is no longer under supervision, which will undoubtedly cause new social inequality.
For this reason, surrogacy is prohibited and not allowed in our country.
Therefore, if an expectant mother gives birth to a new life for something other than love, the issues that may harm the society and the new life will emerge one after another.
Only when love is the reason that the conceiving of life is natural and the life could receive better care.
So, when there is love, there can be new life.
Thank you all.
Thank you, host.
So just now the host mentioned commercial information in ranking auctions, as well as false, misleading, useless, boring or even poisonous information.
Just like you, I am perplexed in the face of these information every day.
And I want to share with you some of my personal experiences.
First of all, I would like to ask everyone, do you want to know what President Obama and President Hu Jintao discussed when they met in South Korea in the past few days?
I mean the video, not the news reports.
Do you want to know what government dignitaries Hillary, the US Secretary of State, was meeting with?
What did she say about China to her partners?
Do you want to know how the US Congressmen and Congresswomen squabbled over the strategies towards Asia and China to a boiling point?
Do you want to know what the moguls in your fields of business are talking about?
When I am commuting or working out in the gym, I would take whatever time I have to track these information instead of listening to music.
The information are not obtained through secret channels.
They are free and available to the public on the Internet.
You can find them as long as you are willing to.
And I also broadened my horizons through this long tracking process, which allows me, in my own words, to live a life knowing everything that I need to know .
I believe that everyone here may also be interested in doing so.
You can try to use these online resources like me.
Next, I am going to tell you a story in which I helped one of my clients, a Hong Kong operator, to bid in a radio spectrum auction a few years ago.
Here I'd like to give you some information about the context.
In China, the domestic mobile network operators, like China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicorn, must obtain government-issued licenses before they go into 2G or 3G mobile network business.
In China, the licenses are directly allocated to operators.
But in many developed countries, they should be obtained in a commercial way, like auctions.
It's the same case with Hong Kong.
The schedule was tight when I accepted the task, and the information I had was less than adequate.
So I plunged into the Internet seeking for useful information like I always did.
Finally, I found the official website of Office of the Communications Authority of Hong Kong.
It's this one.
In one corner of that website, I found all the public information about the spectrum auction, including its plan, procedure and even progress, as well as its earlier hearings.
Then I read those files and got a whole picture of the auction.
You see, with all these true and useful information, how hard can it be for me to work out a plan for my client?
My next story is about smart grid.
Smart grid is very popular, particularly in recent years.
If you haven't heard about it, search online.
But today I'm not going to talk about smart grids.
I want to show you how I quickly built a knowledge system about it.
When you browse online the news about the sector of smart grid, you may find them contradictory and confusing.
But we, as an IT company, cannot plan our business based on these information.
We must know what's really going on with the sector of smart grid.
What is the truth about smart grid?
So I went online in order to gather information as fast as I can.
Later I found that, the National Institute of Standards and Technology of the United States, NIST, had been commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy to conduct a systematic study of smart grid.
And they disclosed all the information about the study and the organizations involved on the Internet.
These information included the blueprints, work plans, serial meeting schedules, meeting minutes, and roadmaps relating to smart grid.
Having gathered these information, I joined in the discussions and I quickly built up a systematic knowledge map which incorporates at least the core information of smart grid.
The other day I ran into one of our industry executives in China, and I asked him, "Have we been involved in similar discussions?"
He said: "No, we will send a delegation to the meetings of the International Standards Organization to acquire related knowledge."
Here I would like to remind you that what the ISO did for this matter was only voting.
The real technical work was done in institutions like NIST.
How do we vote since we did not involve in any of the initial discussions?
I think this is what many of our peers in the industry should reflect on.
In particular, I would like to say to our so-called government think tanks: Have you ever spent time using these good and direct information resources to effectively advise our decision makers?
As the saying goes: "Listen to both sides and you will be enlightened, heed only one side and you will be benighted".
These examples I have shared with you today are intended to tell you that in the face of information as vast as the open sea, I am very confident, to say the least.
I dare to use them without being overwhelmed by their multitude.
This is my attitude towards exploring the truth about information.
As long as you have the mindset like mine, all you need to do is to put it into practice.
So how do you start?
When you're searching online, you can open a few more pages and links.
I believe by doing that, you will be one or more steps closer to the truth.
This has nothing to do with whether or not you know information technology, and it's more irrelevant whether you are an expert.
IT industry has been known for extremely frequent updates.
New concepts, terms, technologies, models, and waves spring up on daily basis.
It's hard to catch up with them.
Nonetheless, I still dare to ride the waves at my age, and I feel very confident to do it.
I think if I can do it, so can you.
Thank you!
Hello, everyone!
Welcome to the advanced course on the UNIT dialogue system.
I'm Sun Shuqi, an R&D engineer for UNIT platform.
In this lesson, we will learn about UNIT's feedback learning mechanism.
The reason for having a feedback learning mechanism is to prevent abnormal conditions from disrupting the normal operation of UNIT.
For example, abnormal requests before NLU and abnormal results after NLU will all cause problems for UNIT's operation.
Ordinary users will find it difficult to deal with such problems, so we need to introduce some mechanisms to solve these problems.
When a request arrives, we first need to determine whether it is a feedback or a normal request.
If it is a feedback, it needs to be sent directly to DM so as to modify the dialogue state and dialogue result at the previous turn.
If it is a normal request, we need to perform a quality check of the NLU result after the NLU procedure.
It will only be sent to DM if the NLU result is of good quality.
If the NLU result is of poor quality, the corresponding clarification mechanism will be triggered to get the user to clarify the result.
Of course, we also need to have a feedback memory mechanism at the end.
The feedback memory mechanism works like this - if a particular request has been given feedback before, subsequent identical or similar requests will be handled using the same feedback result, thus preventing past errors from reoccurring.
Next, let's see what functions there are for feedbacks.
The first function is correcting ASR errors.
There are five ways to do that – clarifying the correct Chinese character by using a word,  clarifying the correct Chinese character by using a radical, clarifying the correct Chinese character by using disassembled components, partial repeating of the phrase, and full repeating of the phrase.
Here are some examples.
As you can see,  speech recognition errors can be fixed.
The second function is intervening in NLU results.
When an error occurs in the interpretation of intents and slots, we can correct the result and thus allow the dialogue to proceed normally by using natural language utterances, as shown in this example.
Aside from intervention mechanisms, there are also clarification mechanisms.
This refers to UNIT's ability to proactively initiate queries regarding potential errors, such as queries about intents and slots when the intents are vague or the slot has more than one possible meaning.
These proactive queries will help to prevent problems from occurring.
Lastly, the feedback memory can be added to the sample set to assist the training of the natural language understanding module.
You can learn more about this function in the feedback learning log.
For example, in this one: "Cai Xukun is so handsome!"
Do you mean you want to listen to his songs?
No, I'm just fangirling.
During this dialogue, "Cai Xukun is so handsome" is labeled as a sys_other intent.
After training, the same clarification process will not be repeated if the same utterance appears again.
Instead, it will be directly handled as a sys_other intent.
OK, that's all for this lesson.
Thank you!
Distinguished guests, good afternoon!

Hello, everyone.
Today, I am pleased to introduce to you how to quickly create an AR app using AR Open SDK.
First, I will introduce the AR access process, which consists of three steps.
First, the developer accesses the Baidu developer backstage with a Baidu account, creates an AR-capable app, and downloads the AR Open SDK.
Second, upload the AR content package to the AR content platform.
Third, integrate the AR SDK into the app.
I shall now demonstrate the whole process.
First, visit ai.baidu.com.
Choose Console.
Log in your Baidu account.
Choose Product Service and then AR.
Click Create App.
Enter App Name.
Choose App Type and Interface Type.
Enter AR Package Name.
Fill in App Description.
Return to App List.
By now, an AR-capable app has been created.
Next, download the AR SDK.
Navigate to the management page.
Click Download SDK.
Find AR.
Two options, one for Android and one for iOS, are provided. Download the one you need.
Let me now introduce these two versions.
First, the Android version.
I will introduce the content in the SDK.
The SDK consists of five parts.
The first part is a basic developer document.
The second part is a demo.
The third part is a libs folder which contains jar packages and corresponding so libraries.
The fourth part is the resources required during AR usage.
Developers can copy them to their projects.
The sample folder contains AR content creation cases.
Developers can conduct development based on these cases.
Next, I will introduce how to upload an AR app.
Find Content Creation.
Choose Create New Project.
Choose a template like IMU Template.
Click on Next Step.
Set Project Title.
Choose the app we created just now, AR test, for Channel Selection.
Click on Next Step.
Choose Resource Package.
For the resource package content, we can find IMU in the sample folder in the AR SDK package we downloaded just now.
Click Submit.
By now, the AR content package in this case has been uploaded successfully.
Two values, AR Key and AR Type, are generated.
They will be used during AR SDK integration.
Next, I will introduce how to integrate the AR Open SDK into your project directory.
First, import the decompressed jar package and corresponding so libraries to your project.
In addition, copy the resource files on which the AR runtime environment depends to your res directory.
Third, configure the Manifest file and add the permissions necessary for the AR runtime environment.
Fourth, initialize the AR environment in the codes and add AR Fragment to your page.
First, initialize resources.
Set the App ID, API Key and Secret Key for your app.
In addition, set the AR Key and AR Type for the resource package that displays the AR content.
The third step is to create an AR Fragment and add the Fragment to your layout.
The AR SDK provides a Callback interface.
It contains three interfaces- one sharing interface, one URL sending interface, and one AR blacklist callback interface.
By now, AR integration has been completed.
Next, we will introduce the iOS version.
Let's take a look at the content of the AR SDK for iOS.
First, the AR SDK folder has a speech synthesis AR SDK, AR-TTS, and a voice recognition AR SDK, AR-Voice.
It also contains the resource package, header files, and customized UI.
Let's take a look at project configuration.
First, in the project, set the Bundle ID as the iOS package name that you entered when creating the app.
Second, choose Build Setting in project configuration and set Other Linker Flags.
Third, if the AR SDK of the general availability version is used, you need to import the aip.license.
Fourth, enable the relevant permissions.
Fifth, add third-party system libraries required by Dumix AR.
Let's go to a relevant target project to perform detailed configuration.
First, add the third-party system libraries, AFNetworking and ZipArchive.a, which are required by Dumix AR, to the project.
Then, add BaiduAR.bundle and its resource files to the project.
Then, add OpenUI, the include folder, and Dumix AR to the project.
Then, set Other Linker Flags in Build Settings.
Then, in the Info list, enable the camera permission, photo library permission, and microphone permission.
Then, add the required third-party libraries to the Build Phases page, including system libraries, AF, and Zip.
By now, the project configuration for AR SDK integration has been completed.
Next, let's take a look at how to set the App ID, API Key, and Secret Key.
In AppDelegate, import BaiduARSDK.
Then, when the application launches, an if-statement is required to judge whether your phone model supports AR or not.
If so, set the BundlePath, that is, the resource path.
Then, set the APP ID, API Key, and Secret Key.
By now, the whole AR project has been completed.
That's all for today.
For more information, visit the Baidu Augmented Reality website at ar.baidu.com.
Thank you.
Hello, everyone!
I'm Li Peng from Baidu Institute of Deep Learning.
Welcome to our course, Deeping Learning  by PaddlePaddle.
In this course, we will focus on basic technologies while keeping track of the cutting-edge progress.
After this course, we hope that you will have a basic understanding of machine learning, know how to use deep learning to solve basic problems related to image processing and natural language processing, and learn to use PaddlePaddle to realize related models.
This is a 3-unit course, including eight lessons.
In Unit 1, I will give you a brief introduction on the basics of machine leanrning.
In Unit 2, we will learn basic image processing technology and its realization through two tasks, handwritten digit recognition and image classification.
In Unit 3,  we will focus on five problems, that is,  word embedding,  recommandation system, sentiment analysis, semantic role labeling and machine translation, to show you how to use deep learning to tackle NLP problems and how to realize
Well, for your convenience, we have also prepared an interactive ebook. For the configuration details you can refer to the introduction in Beginner's Guide.
All right. We are ready. Welcome to our course, Deeping Learning  by PaddlePaddle!
Hello, everyone!
Our course is about the art of coding.
To begin with, I'll introduce myself.
I'm the technical leader of the BFE Team of the Operation and Maintenance Department.
I'm also a member of Baidu's Python and Golang code master comittees.
If you want to know more about me, you can visit my wiki page.
Firstly, I'd like to talk about why we have this course.
Many of you have just graduated from college and come to Baidu.
I'd like to point out first that programming in Baidu is quite different from that in college.
When you were students, you programmed for your course assignments or your teachers' projects.
So I assume mediocre coding would just do.
However, in Baidu we are making industrial products for hundreds of millions of users, which requires codes with higher quality.
Secondly, I want to clear up some of your misunderstandings through this course.
Many of you call programmers “coding farmers” in a self-mocking way.
Many of you believe that you'll no longer have the energy to continue writing codes after the age of 35.
Some of you reckon that the only way for programmers is to become managers.
So this course aims to shed a new light on the profession of programmers, as well as to give you a correct understanding of software programming.
We often ask which one is more important, knowledge or action.
You have to have a proper knowledge to take a proper action.
We also hope that through this course you can find your way as a software engineer.
It is often said that art is created by artists.
Actually an artist has his or her own way of perfecting the skills.
In short, we hope that you will gain a brand new understanding of the profession of software engineers.
Now we will have a look at Baidu Translate API.
How do we invoke the open API of Baidu Translate?
We can log in to the platform address api.fanyi.baidu.com.
Then we will see a page with four tabs.
Home Page introduces how to apply for permission and how to access the Baidu Translate API service.
In API Documentation are more detailed descriptions, including definitions of some parameters, descriptions of error codes, some demo programs, and FAQ.
In Help and Support you can find what languages this open platform supports and how to call the service.
In Management Console you can manage your developer account and find your usage log.
Now, I will show you how to use the API .The picture on the left shows the procedure of application.
For example, if I am a developer and I want to call Baidu Translate, what should I do? I should apply for permission on the previous page. Once we receive your application, an APP ID and a secret key will be assigned to you.
Then you can access the translation service with the APP ID and secret key.
Actually you are accessing to the server of Baidu Translate API. After the server receives requests, it will distribute them to translation terminals.
After the translation terminals finish translating, the results will be returned to the developer.
For example, we send a request for translating a very simple word “Hello”.
After receiving the request, Baidu Translate API server will assign it to a translation terminal, and then the erminal returns the translation result of "Hello".
Shown next is the detailed API documentation. We can visit this address.
I will give a quick explanation on some of the field names used in the documentation.
The first field name is q for query.
The query field indicates the text that we need to translate. It need to be UTF-8 encoded.
The second field is named FROM.
The FROM field indicates the source language, for example, whether the source language is Chinese or English, or Arabic, or any other languages.
If you don't specify a language here, you can set the field to auto.
If it is set to auto, our system will automatically determine the source language.
The third field is named TO.
The TO field indicates the target language.
Of course we cannot set its value to auto, because we have to specify which language we want to translate the source text into.
The next field is named appid.
It indicates the APP ID assigned in the application, which can be seen in the Management Console.
The next field is for a user-defined random number.
With the APP ID, the query, the random number and the secret key, we can generate a MD5 value, that is, a signature.
It is mainly for security reasons.
So, in what format is the result returned by the translation API? It is in JSON format.
The result returned by the translation API is in JSON, consisting of three fields.
One is the FROM field, indicating the source language.
The second is the TO field, indicating the target language.
The third is the field of translation result.
It contains two subfields: the source text and the translation. The translation is exactly the result we need.
Here is a simple example. It has only 27 lines of code. You'll see how to use the API from this example.
For example, we can save the file as transapi.php, and you can copy this paragraph to your own program.
By setting the q field, the FROM field, the TO field, and setting the appid and the secret key, we can do the translation.
Ok, let’s run this program now.
The line on the top is the command we need to run the program.
For example, if we set the source language field to auto, the system will automatically determine the source language.
Aand the target language is set to ZH, standing for Chinese.
All the supported languages and their corresponding codes can be found on the website.
For example, we want to translate such a sentence "What are you doing now?".
Ok, let’s type it into the program.
After paring the returned JSON string, we can see that the translation result of "What are you doing now" is returned.
You can use this program to translate anything you like.
Here are two application cases.
On the left is a case of Sansung Mobile calling Baidu Translate API. It is S-pen Translate.
For example, hovering your S-Pen onto any words on the screen of your Samsung mobile phone, the translation you want will instantly show up in front of you. You don't even need to leave the current screen and switch to another app.
For example, when we read on a brower any foreign-language text that we don't understand, we usually copy the text and paste it to a translation software to get the translation.
But with the S-pen Translate feature, we can diectly select the words we want to translate.
The picture on the right shows a case of ZTE Mobile calling Baidu Translate API.
They combine speech and translation technologies to provide speech-to-speech transltion.
Of course, speech-to-speech translation is also a feature of Baidu Translate App.
Baidu Translate API was launched in May 2012. It now supports translation among 28 languages.
The number of languages it can translate is increasing. and the advantage of this API is that there is no limit on access frequency, and the service level agreement, SLA, is up to 99.99%.
Each month you can enjoy a free translation service for no more than 2 million characters.
If you have more to translate, we will charge a fee accordingly. But It's not high, it's obsolutely reasonable.
At present, 20 thousand developers are using the Baidu Translate API.
Among them are Kingsoft iCiba, Huawei, OPPO, ZTE, Samsung, Alipay, and the World Intellectual Property Organization.
All of them have established a good cooperative relationship with Baidu Translate.
Other users and developers are also welcome to access Baidu Translate through API and experience the service of Baidu Translate.
Thank you.
Hello, everyone!
Welcome to the advanced course on the UNIT dialogue system.
I am Sun Shuqi, an R&D engineer for the UNIT platform.
In this lesson, we will learn about dialogue states and action triggers.
During the previous lesson on dialogue management, we learned about the various dialogue management functions on UNIT, which are performed by using dialogue states and action triggers.
In fact, a dialogue state is passed over each turn of a dialogue.
We may often find dialogues like these when booking a hotel, for example.
In a multi-turn dialogue, intents, slots and other information of each turn need to be passed, and they constitute the entire dialogue state.
A dialogue state is also called a session.
It is stored in the bot_session field of the request interface and the response interface.
All of you should have seen this field in the documents.
It is passed between UNIT and the developer, or the requester.
And, it is updated by UNIT.
When certain conditions have been fulfilled, the developer can also clear the dialogue state, that is, to reset it.
For example, we can clear it when there is a change of intents.
We may also configure the system to not store sessions before the Nth turn of dialogue.
It works just like in the diagram on the left.
First, we have an empty session and we pass it to UNIT.
UNIT responds and at the same time updates the session.
Then, during the second round of request, the session is passed as it is, and so on and so forth.
UNIT will clear the session when a certain condition is triggered.
The requester can also send an empty session to clear the current one.
With dialogue states, we can trigger dialogue actions based on some Boolean rules.
Boolean rules essentially involve the operations of AND, OR, and NOT.
They can be used to determine what the intent of the previous turn is, Whether the slots of this turn or the previous turn have been filled, and if so, whether it contains something or whether it equals to something.
The picture on the right shows such expressions on our system interface.
There are a series of trigger rules and some expressions.
These rules can be placed into groups within which they are of the AND relation, and among which they are of the OR relation.
We can trigger a series of dialogue actions based on such Boolean expressions.
What kinds of dialogue actions specifically?
As we can see, there are three.
The first one is answering, the second one is guide toward a dialogue intent, and the third is guide toward a Q&A intent.
Answering include two types, namely answering in text form and executing functions.
You can read the detailed descriptions of these types of answering in the diagram on the left.
I shan't go over them in detail.
Next, I have two tips to share.
First, we can have different actions triggered in different sequences.
Second, we can provide multiple dialogue actions for the developer, or the caller at the same time, then allow them to decide which ones to execute, ranging from all to none.
OK, that's about it.
Thank you!
Everybody wants to make some changes in life, only that life is not so easy to be changed.
There is one fairly easy way you might count on though: through design.
The following pictures show a designer of our company.
He says his mom sees him as an artist and a good drawer.
In the eyes of his friends and clients, he is a maniac with crazy ideas.
Designers, according to the public, are more or less a group of eccentrics.
But what exactly are those designers like?
I've just said something about the designers.
Now perhaps, since we've known more about them, we could return to this question: what is design?
To define or explain the connotation of design sounds like a conundrum, so here I'd prefer to share with you some of what I call the great works of design.
The public always holds that designers create very fancy works.
Only those splendid works, such as a particular object or a car, or only the Italian designs, are thought to deserve the title "great".
That is not true.
Look around and watch closely, we will find in our life a lot of great designs.
Like this product here, whose global sales have far surpassed that of IPhone.
It's a core product of 3M, named "the Post-It note".
So could this be called a design? What is this? It is nothing so fancy, but it is a truly great design.
Then there is the zipper, invented during World War II.
It looks neither so fancy nor so cool, but it is essential to us.
Let's take a look at this one. It is a simple, square card, but it helps conduct financial, cash and bank settlement in a unified system.
All those are great designs in our life.
They are not necessarily created by a master, but could rather be the creation of any one of you.
Now let's take three minutes to make a simple design, a very small one. Let's design a toothbrush.
I want to do this because I'd like to tell you how designers work.
Now there are already so many kinds of toothbrushes on the market, how can we create a new toothbrush that is different from them?
First, we have to look from a different angle. In what aspect can our toothbrush be different?
To find where it could be different from others is the first step.
Second, we have to watch closely and notice the details.
Why does this toothbrush have pointed bristles, and that one, thicker bristles?
That means different functions and different demands from consumers.
We also need to think about technologies beyond the scope of toothbrush manufacturing, for example, is there any new material or new possibilities for our toothbrush?
And of course the trend is also our concern.
We'll study how people would like our design to go in future, and what they'd really want.
After studying so many resources and basics, we'll compare and find a possibility, which is not necessarily a toothbrush though.
Then we learn to translate this possibility into a tangible language, which might generate many sub-possibilities.
But not all of them can be successful in market.
We have to filter, layer by layer, through the consumers, the market and our clients. And finally there is the best one left.
Here I also want to introduce some designers to you.
Some of them perhaps you are quite familiar with.
Who is it? It is a designer. So is he.
This is a designer of music.
His name is John Lennon.
And Wright Brothers, who invented the airplane.
And Zhang Yimou, a designer of films.
This is our great chief designer, who designs our life.
This is a designer in science.
This is a designer in music.
And this is also a designer.
Designer is not a stereotyped occupation.
The only thing that matters is whether you can think different, take different perspectives and catch things that elude others.
Once I visited a friend in a German design company.
The first thing I saw in his office was a kayak suspended from the ceiling.
So I asked him for the reason.
They said because the most beautiful part of a boat was its bottom.
Designers must dare to look beneath the surface and see things others don't see.
That's the crucial key—thinking different.
Unfortunately, Chinese people are prey to the herd mentality.
If a girl wears a miniskirt, then it is quite possible that one or two days later her colleagues will wear a miniskirt too.
This herd mentality in consumption restrains our independent thinking.
There is another hindrance.
For over two thousand years China was governed by imperial powers, whose rule depended on uniformity.
In our company, there is a popular saying that goes, which goes, Chinese businessmen are all like Wu Dalang, a famous Chinese fictional dwarf.
They can't stand employees who are more capable than themselves. They will just lay you off if you stand out.
All the things above contribute to the media's grilling: why does China never have a Steve Jobs?
The reason is we dare not challenge the authority, the standards, or ourselves.
Challenging things should be the first step to be taken.
We must change ourselves if we want things to change in life.
Here I'd like to share with you how, as designers, we can change ourselves. There are three steps.
First, never yield to standards.
Second, try to break down the standards.
Third, try to create something new.
Those three steps are the trilogy that marks a good start for a designer.
Then what exactly is design?
Actually even till now I haven't yet figured out how to describe or define it.
Over twenty years of designing experience have taught me one thing: design is in fact a way of thinking and working.
The gist is to think from different angles.
So if we want to change our life and design our own destiny, we'd better learn to change ourselves first and invent a new way of thinking.
That's all I want to share with you today as a designer.
Thank you!
