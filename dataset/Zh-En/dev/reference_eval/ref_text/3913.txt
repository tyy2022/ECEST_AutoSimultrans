Good Evening, everyone.
I don't know if you know this person.
He is a very famous speaker in Australia, Nick.
He has no limbs, and he likes to tease his only little leg very much.
He calls it drumstick.
In fact, it is very difficult for us to imagine or understand how he lives.
First thought that came to me was how could he manage to survive?
How can he live with such a very good and optimistic state of mind and state of life?
It turns out he is living very well now.
He is making speeches everywhere.
He not only recognizes and believes in himself, he also brings his confidence to everyone who listens to his speeches.
Many people were moved and cried when they heard what he said, and finally they would look back at themselves: Am I saying yes to myself?
Am I confident in myself?
Even a disabled person with no limbs like him, though physically handicapped, still has such a perfect character and perfect spirit.
So what should we do?
What kind of affirmation should we have for ourselves?
I especially admire a disabled athlete when I was an athlete.
I used to be a wheelchair fencer.
Once I met an American boy in a contest who was in a wheelchair, too, his grade was B.
The so-called Class A and Class B refer to two grades for athlete's conditions in wheelchair fencing.
Grade A are those like me, with a functional lumbar spine that can move back and forth, because wheelchair fencing is fixed.
So what is Grade B?
Grade B are those with lumbar paralysis who have no senses below the waist.
But this athlete of Grade B has very, very serious conditions among the Grade B fencers I have seen.
Why?
Except for his lumbar paralysis, he even loses the three fingers of his hand holding the sword.
Do you know how he held the sword?
He managed to sit in the wheelchair for competiton with the help of others.
After he sat in the wheelchair, he had his hand to hold the sword tied to his own hand bandages on a glove, and then he would stab the other side very hard.
However, I can always see him in every World Cup and championship.
He has always been ranked among the last, so to speak, the last in those games.
What kind of spirit supported him to take part in the competition all the time?
You know, everyone is afraid of losing, right?
Everyone does not want to lose; rather, they all want to win.
When he lost every match or even came in the second last or last place, what was it or what kind of strength supported him to compete and train all the time?
Later it occurred to me that he must like this sport.
He loves this sport.
So he enjoys it even if he loses.
It is the kind of person who makes me feel I can do everything.
With that, what is the limit of human beings?
Many of our functions have deteriorated, but in fact, human beings are the animals that can adapt to the environment best.
Why?
Although I have one leg, I have never thought I would have any problem surviving in this society since I just have my leg amputated.
I think that I can survive no matter what.
My job may not be particularly good, but I think I can find a job, which is my reason of confidence.
Many people say that I am not able to do it.
In fact, it's not that you can't do it.
Not really.
It's just that you haven't come to the moment.
To survive in this environment, one can always find various ways to adapt oneself to it.
Then when you have one leg, you must survive as always, so I learned to jump when I just started to be one-leg.
Later, when I got my crutch for the first time, I said to myself in the mind: "Wow! This pair of crutches feels just like the crutches I should have been born with. How can I walk so freely?"
Until now, many people still ask me, "Jin Jing, why don't you put on artificial limbs?"
"How beautiful your legs look with artificial limbs," They would say.
Why don't I use artificial limbs?
First, I can't wear high-heeled shoes when wearing artificial limbs.
I still like wearing them.
Girls look very tall and straight when wearing high-heels.
Second, wearing artificial limbs is really not as convenient as people think.
I am a practical type.
I wouldn't force myself into a beautiful look, which turns out to affect my normal life.
So why do I need a prosthetic leg?
Just to be good-looking?
In the eyes of other people?
I would say I am also pretty good-looking this way, what do you say?
So sometimes I think it is very, very important for me to affirm myself and be confident in myself.
By the terms used by athletes, the process of torch relay is like a process from individual competition to team competition.
Because when I came down from the coach for torch carriers, I found that many people around me were hostile,  unfriendly protesters who even tried to grab the torch from me.
At that time, I thought, oh, why would they be like this?
Why would such a thing happen?
Out of an athlete's instinct, I would feel so angry, because it happened to be the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Olympics in our own country.
Later, it wan't until later when our Chinese overseas students come to join this team that I found: Wow, actually I am not alone.
It turns out I have such a huge force behind me.
If you are really sure about yourself, about all the decisions you have made, or the things you have done, then on what ground will you refuse to believe in our people, in us, and in our country's future destined to be better?
We really, really hope that besides giving a little confidence, a little recognition to ourselves and all our close friends, our country, our motherland can also give more people a little recognition and a little confidence.
Thank you.
