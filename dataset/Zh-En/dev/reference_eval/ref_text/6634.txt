Good evening, everyone.
I am Liao Zile from Shanghai World Foreign Language Academy.
My grades are neither poor nor good, and I'm definitely not a well-behaved kid in the traditional sense.
But I have a special hobby: fiddling with robots.
So my friends like to call me "Mac the Robot".
Since my 3rd year in primary school I've been touring around with my coach, as well as my robot friends, through all kinds of robot competitions across the world and have won some prizes.
Last year, I won the second prize in the World Educational Robot Contest hosted by Trinity College.
This year, I won another second prize in the World Educational Robot Contest staged in US.
Always the second prize. Maybe that word "two" just loves me ("Two" also means "silly" in Chinese).
You might at first take me as a cute, good and polite boy.
Indeed, if you stay with me for five minutes, there is a good chance that you might exclaim, "What a good boy!"
If the five minutes extend to five hours, I bet your previous good opinion of me will be overthrown.
"This boy is a nuisance", you might say.
If the time you spend with me is further lengthened to five days, I'm sure you will finally conclude, "well, this is actually a problem kid."
Alas, why is it so?
Because I don't quite listen to what adults say.
Precisely speaking, I listen to them 65% of the time.
The other 35% of the time I just follow my own ideas.
But you adults obviously don't like that.
That means I always live a miserable life.
Being scolded has become such a routine for me that it seems as if the day never dawns nor darkens without me being reprimanded.
The most frequent advice for me is, "Can you just listen to me?"
But the problem is, I do listen.
Only that I listen selectively, and I keep my independence 35% of the time.
Since my 3rd year in primary school I've been thinking, "Must I fully yield to adults?
Can I at least have some say in my own life?
As my contemplation deepens, I come to realize that adults have their own world, and children should also construct a world that belongs only to them.
I've also found something disturbing in adults along the way.
Here I'll give you some examples.
The first thing is, I find adults, like running wheels, tend to put endless demands on children.
Take me for example.
When I was in 5th grade in primary school, my dad repeatedly warned me, "You must get the direct, exam-exempted access to the junior high school. Or else you will be doomed."
So I kept working hard, until finally I secured a place at the junior high school in the second semester of the 5th grade.
Time to relax, I told myself.
But my dad posed yet another challenge, "You must also get a place in the elite class of the junior high school, or else you still have little chance to win."
Poor me.
I had to start yet another round of tough study.
My labor was rewarded and finally I was given a place in the elite class.
My dad, however, was still not satisfied.
School began, and I scampered around to pack up my things.
Then my dad said, "You have to make it into the top 15 of the class. It should not be so hard. I believe you can do that."
But dad, you should know that the elite class usually gathers the best of the best students.
How can I have a chance to squeeze into the top 15?
I can imagine that, when I graduate from the junior high school, my dad will definitely say to me, "You must get into the top four high schools."
After that, when I end my high school life, he will again push me, "You must go to the top-rated universities."
Things are just like that. You adults are always putting demands on children, and there is no end to your demands.
As far as I know, such things also happen to my classmates.
Those hopes of yours, I should say, are actually your own unfulfilled dreams that you impose upon us.
But I think we children should also have our own dreams.
The second thing I've found is that you adults seem very reluctant to admit your own mistakes.
You agree with me on this?
I used to be a frequent visitor at the Xinhua Bookstore, reading or buying books there, when I was in 5th grade of primary school.
I still remember two scenes I saw there.
In the first scene, a mother, after feeding water to her child from a cup, put the cup on the ground, but the lid wasn't fastened tightly on the cup.
When the child turned around to pick books, he accidentally trod on and kicked over the cup.
So what would you do if you were this mother?
I bet you would be furious and give the child a good scolding.
And so the mother did.
But I just want to say, would this accident still have happened if the lid of the cup had been firmly fastened in the first place?
The second scene was about a father who led his child to pick books.
The child drank some water from a cup, and again, leaving the cup loosely covered.
Then the cup was kicked over by the father by accident.
And the father, again, like the mother in the first scene, showered the child with scolding.
"Why didn't you screw the lid tight?" he snapped, "If you had done that, nothing would have happened."
Well, now this, now that, I just don't understand, why is everything the children's fault?
The third thing I notice is that adults are strict with children, but are lenient with themselves.
For example, playing digital games is what we children naturally like, but adults, either teachers or parents, keep saying that digital games are bad, will disrupt study and lead to poor grades.
So we are only permitted to use digital products without any gaming functions.
Even the electronic dictionary we use is stripped of all games, however unthreatening they are, like Snake, so as to make sure the dictionary is safe.
But just look around, there are adults everywhere with eyes glued to their cell phone, whether at dinner, or during a meeting, or on the subway, or driving a car.
I can even see from here that some of you are using your cell phone right now.
The irrefutable reason adults give us for all this injustice is: because we are adults, we can use cell phones.
And because you are children, you just can't.
What a logic!
The fourth thing I find is that adults sometimes are even slower to forgive than children.
For example, a naughty boy like me might easily invite scolding, and sometimes I might have issues with my classmates.
But generally no matter whether I am unfairly treated, I just learn to endure.
Sometimes unhappy things happen between me and my friends, but we soon make up.
The worst enemy fighting me in the morning can become my intimate buddy again in the afternoon.
But look at you adults, how often you hold a lifelong grudge!
And you even fabricate a phrase for your act: it is never too late for revenge.
So I am thinking, if one day we have to grow into adults like you who always let unhappy things weigh on the mind, then what's the point of our growing up?
It is because of those things I've found about you adults that I choose to keep your advice at arm's length.
I believe, 65% of the time, what you say is absolutely right and I must accept it for my own good.
But for the other 35% of the time, I want to be my own master.
With the 35%, I will have my own world, and with the 65% I can stand on the shoulders of  giants before me.
I can achieve more and have my own future.
Thank you!
