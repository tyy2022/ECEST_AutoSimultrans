Good afternoon, everyone.
Three apples have changed the world.
The first one helped Adam discover that he is pant-less.
The second apple brought Newton to Universal Gravitation.
The third Apple let us know that everyone deserves a smartphone.
And my apple, in this sense, is this picture, which was taken around 70 years ago.
The two people in the picture split away after they took the picture.
What's interesting about this picture is that both wore the same type of suit named as Zhongshan Suit.
The Zhongshan suit was introduced by Sun Yat-sen.
It actually contains much information.
For instance, it has five buttons that represent separation of five powers.
What about the four pockets?
They stand for the four foundations of a nation.
Courtesy, righteousness, honesty and sense of shame.
There are three buttons on the right sleeve, representing the tenet - "of the people, by the people and for the people".
And three on the left, standing for equality, freedom and fraternity of mankind.
Well, from the perspective of computers, they have basically the same interface, is that right?
But we all know deep down inside, their kernels are different.
Or to put it this way: one group of people followed the Three Principles of People and Christianity and another pursued the Marxism-Leninism.
They are just like two “operating systems” battling against each other.
In the end, the one on the left went somewhere else.
And that place is called Taiwan, which has witnessed rapid development over the years.
Over the course of last 70 years, Chinese Mainland and Taiwan have experienced drastic changes that are quite different from each other.
We all can feel that.
We can compare from various aspects such as economy, culture and many others.
But why would there be such huge differences?
For instance, in the mobile internet industry, we have the iOS operating system and Android system, an ecosystem created by Google.
Microsoft is doing the similar thing, aspiring to remake itself as one of the mobile internet giants.
You see, all competition is after all the competition of operating systems.
So when we see the world via this operating system, the society, shouldn't we also be thinking through a social operating system?
Or in the case of the mobile internet, do you understand what's competing here?
It is actually a competition between different operating systems.
That's the reason why Google, founder of Android, took a strong stance lately, quite surprisingly, forbidding Acer to release phones that have installed Alibaba's operating system.
So now you have a sense of the importance of differences in operating systems.
But what is it like in the light of society?
In fact, civilization is what's defined as operating system in the social context.
Here in the chart, there are four levels and seven modules that can match one another.
For example, our heart is like hardware with a CPU.
So how do we drive our body, so to speak?
Of course sex drives our body.
Anything else that you see?
There is a kernel, which is the way we see the world, that drives our body.
Right?
Over it, there are our values and prospects of life.
So accordingly, there are many other virtual machines or parts built above the operating system, something we normally refer to as basic service.
Another important thing is language which I've marked in another color.
This language is what we use to communicate, just like the one we use to communicate with people.
Above that we can create our own applications, right?
We have different applications inside the iOS or Android system, regarding many aspects of our life, such as clothes, food, housing, travel, medicines and elderly care, and even corporates, laws and institutions.
Everything can find its counterpart in the past.
We live in this operating system, just like our phones.
So do we have room for multiple operating systems in a large system?
Does it work that way?
So how do we do it?
We might try to build our own operating system using this way.
Four levels, seven modules.
You can replace the modules as you want.
You all hear me.
For example, what is sex?
The desire for food and sex is part of human nature.
What is our core operating system?
It's about changes.
The Chinese classic, Book of Changes, touches upon lots of changes.
Going beyond it, we have our Five Constant Virtues adn our propaganda slogan.
What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.
Going beyond, we have our social framework.
What is it then?
Family.
Family is the foundation on which our nation and society are constructed.
And over it is our language.
This social operating system is quite simple, actually, perhaps the simplest one in the world among all the other operating systems.
This system was developed almost 2500 years ago.
Who developed it?
Confucius.
Who were on his team?
Ten core CXOs, or the so-called Ten Philosophers: including Zilu, Zigong, Zengshen and etc.
And who else?
Other 72 "Project Managers" who he deemed also as good performers as well as the other 3000 disciples as his programmers.
Right?
How many years did they take to develop such a system?
Almost 14 years during which they paid visits to 10 countries.
What was he doing then?
To promote his system.
And it had good results.
At least the system he created is still alive after 2000 years.
What's gone are applications built on the system, like the Qing Dynasty, Yuan Dynasty, Song Dynasty.
The applications have come and gone but never the structure of the system, right?
You see that the very meaning of the system, including its courtesy and the idea of family, stays.
This understanding reminds us of the fact that we do have something.
If you do it all over again, you can spot other operating systems, including the western civilization based on Socrates' philosophy, or Islam by Muhammad, whose influences are in fact overshadowed by ours.
So why on earth did we abandon our operating system?
So what are we waiting for?
I think from my perspective, from our perspective, it is about time.
For what?
Let's open our heart and reinstall our operating system.
Thank you!
