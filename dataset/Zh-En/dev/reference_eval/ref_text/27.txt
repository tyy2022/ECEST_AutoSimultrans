Hello, everyone!
Our course is about the art of coding.
To begin with, I'll introduce myself.
I'm the technical leader of the BFE Team of the Operation and Maintenance Department.
I'm also a member of Baidu's Python and Golang code master comittees.
If you want to know more about me, you can visit my wiki page.
Firstly, I'd like to talk about why we have this course.
Many of you have just graduated from college and come to Baidu.
I'd like to point out first that programming in Baidu is quite different from that in college.
When you were students, you programmed for your course assignments or your teachers' projects.
So I assume mediocre coding would just do.
However, in Baidu we are making industrial products for hundreds of millions of users, which requires codes with higher quality.
Secondly, I want to clear up some of your misunderstandings through this course.
Many of you call programmers “coding farmers” in a self-mocking way.
Many of you believe that you'll no longer have the energy to continue writing codes after the age of 35.
Some of you reckon that the only way for programmers is to become managers.
So this course aims to shed a new light on the profession of programmers, as well as to give you a correct understanding of software programming.
We often ask which one is more important, knowledge or action.
You have to have a proper knowledge to take a proper action.
We also hope that through this course you can find your way as a software engineer.
It is often said that art is created by artists.
Actually an artist has his or her own way of perfecting the skills.
In short, we hope that you will gain a brand new understanding of the profession of software engineers.
