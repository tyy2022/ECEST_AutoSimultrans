furthermore , the Security Council decided in its resolution 2@@ 190 ( 2014 ) that UNMIL should coordinate with the United Nations Mission for E@@ bola Emergency Response ( UN@@ MEE@@ R ) in the provision of humanitarian assistance and support in response to the E@@ bola crisis .
10 . the lower requirement under facilities and infrastructure ( $ 3.8 million ) is mainly due to : ( a ) the re@@ prioritization of funds to meet the additional costs of the E@@ bola outbreak ; ( b ) lower fuel prices ; and ( c ) the classification of freight to the &quot; other supplies , services and equipment &quot; class of expenditure in line with the new chart of accounts .
8 . requests the Secretary @-@ General to continue to take all measures necessary to mitigate potential risks and to ensure that the construction project is monitored closely and is completed within the approved tim@@ eline and resources ;

moreover , in 2014 , around 25,000 planes used Er@@ can Airport for arrival and departure and 200,000 planes used the Er@@ can Advisory Air@@ space .
as I have stated on numerous occasions , the region as a whole shares my country &apos;s concern over the British milit@@ arization of the South Atlantic , which has been den@@ ounced by various international forums because it creates an unnecessary and unjustified tension in the South Atlantic , a nuclear @-@ weapon @-@ free zone characterized by its commitment to peace .
18 . the Final Document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference endorsed additional steps aimed at supporting the implementation of the 1995 Resolution , including that IAEA , the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and other relevant international organizations be requested to prepare background documentation for the 2012 Conference regarding modalities for a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems , taking into account work previously undertaken and experience gained .
the facilitator and his team have participated in various events organized by civil society actors and have sought to actively engage with non @-@ governmental organizations , academia and think tanks .

4 . Algeria ap@@ pl@@ aud@@ s the holding of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) Forum on the relevance of ongoing experiences for the creation of an N@@ W@@ F@@ Z in the Middle East , held in Vienna on 21 and 22 November 2011 .
the 2012 Conference shall take as its terms of reference the 1995 Resolution . &quot;
in particular , does the law applicable to the enforcement of international commercial settlement agreements include :
2 . even if the mediation instrument contains an international commercial settlement agreement , in order for that instrument to have the effect of an enforceable ruling and of res judic@@ ata , it must result from mediation proceedings with the participation of a medi@@ ator accredited by a mediation centre registered with the Council of the Judiciary .
26 . gender architecture and parity remains a particularly weak area across the United Nations system , with only 21 per cent of rati@@ n@@ gs falling into the &quot; meets &quot; or &quot; exceeds &quot; categories , and a very slow rate of progress of a 1 percentage point increase in entities r@@ ated as &quot; meets &quot; or &quot; exceeds &quot; requirements from 2013 to 2014 .
accordingly , the present report aims at providing an overview of progress in implementing the Action Plan , including of entity @-@ specific remedial action plans , lessons learned and next steps , and in mainstreaming gender equality in common programming processes of the United Nations at the country level , including through the United Nations Development Assistance Framework and other planning frameworks .
for example , in September 2014 , the number of notifications received was 27 , which exceeded a specified conjunction threshold value .
total number of inter@@ oper@@ able international humanitarian response tools and services adapted
the depth of institutional adaptation or change will depend on the capabilities and nature of each institution , whether it is legislative , executive , judicial or operational .
for this institutional framework to be effective , it will need to fill the regulatory and implementation deficit that has thus far characterized governance in the area of sustainable development .
many current safety standards , based on decades of use of non @-@ fl@@ am@@ m@@ able technologies in the sectors , appear to restrict alternatives .
reaffirming its commitment to assist the parties to achieve a just , lasting , and mutually acceptable political solution , which will provide for the self @-@ determination of the people of Western Sahara in the context of arrangements consistent with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations , and noting the role and responsibilities of the parties in this respect ,
6 . affirms its full support for the commitment of the Secretary @-@ General and his Personal Envoy towards a solution to the question of Western Sahara in this context and calls for renewed meetings and strengthening of contacts ;
due to the gravity of the situation of the war @-@ stric@@ ken population and their urgent need of humanitarian assistance , the Islamic Republic of Iran has tried by all means to alleviate the suffering of the affected Yemeni people , efforts that have mostly been th@@ war@@ ted by the coalition forces .
only through Yemeni @-@ led and Yemeni @-@ owned national dialogue , with the participation of the representatives of all political parties and social groups , can we en@@ vision a prospect for peace and stability .
Government @-@ provided personnel
Sri Lan@@ kan authorities would cooperate with and provide necessary information to the CI@@ AB@@ OC .

organizational structure and post distribution for 2016 @-@ 2017
17 . security personnel , including members of the national armed forces and internal security forces , who were kidn@@ apped and taken hostage in August 2014 during an incur@@ sion of armed men belonging to the N@@ us@@ ra Front and IS@@ IL , have still not been released .
the Deputy Secretary @-@ General met with the Spe@@ aker of Parliament and the Prime Minister , as well as with Patri@@ ar@@ ch B@@ ech@@ ara Boutros al @-@ Rah@@ i , during his visit to Lebanon from 14 to 17 December 2014 .
18 . in the present context , States parties must not get left behind by the dynamic that is starting to develop around the need to ban im@@ moral weapons .
from May to November 1947 , another 10,@@ 105 Cri@@ mean T@@ at@@ ars died of star@@ v@@ ation in Uzbekistan ( 9 per cent of those deported to the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic ) .
Switzerland has played an active role , both in terms of institutional strengthening and in the review process of the Human Rights Council ; it has , moreover , been a key driver in the establishment of the Office of the President of the Human Rights Council .
for example , the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land @-@ based Activities includes multi @-@ stakeholder partnerships in nutri@@ ents , waste@@ water management and marine lit@@ ter which consider the economic and social issues in addition to the environmental aspects .
115 . the science @-@ policy interface must also be w@@ oven into initiatives so as to not only enable an understanding of the possibilities afforded by oceans , but also to ensure informed decisions and the proper monitoring of the result@@ ant actions ( see paras . 129 @-@ 132 ) .
he clearly tries to excuse the nuclear attacks on Hi@@ ro@@ shima and Nag@@ as@@ aki and cruel@@ ly refers to the resulting enormous loss of human lives as a tri@@ vial matter .
despite the previous de@@ ce@@ it@@ ful man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ res , the official points to nuclear war@@ heads this regime has in its possession .
collective and concrete action is needed to ha@@ st@@ en the end of this il@@ legitimate , im@@ moral and inhumane occupation and the realization of Palestinian freedom .
recently , 320 Palestinians were temporarily forced to leave their homes and livestock owing to these activities , which , in the past , have led to the destruction of Palestinian land and property in the area , including the burning of 3,000 d@@ un@@ ums of crops after a fire caused by military dri@@ ll@@ s on 28 April and the burning of 5,000 d@@ un@@ ums of land on 4 May owing to heavy military fire .
the effectiveness of the remedy is also limited in practice for the authors , given that there are seven district councils in S@@ hin@@ y@@ anga alone , which are predominantly male and can exercise their discretion in deciding to amend customary law .
this is one practical approach which ensures that States parties to the Treaty on the Non @-@ Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons have access to the peaceful uses of civil nuclear energy , while upholding high standards of safety , security and non @-@ proliferation .
26 . the security and safety of our nuclear weapons is given the very highest priority and is entirely consistent with our obligations under non @-@ proliferation agreements .
affirm the commitment of all Arab States to participate in the 2012 conference ; and
1 . the issue of the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons has long occupied the international community .

the three members of the Commission who voted against adoption requested that the recommendation be accompanied by a summary of their diver@@ gen@@ ces of opinion , in accordance with rule 46 of the rules of procedure of the Commission .
1 . during the twentieth session of the International Seabed Authority in 2014 , the Legal and Technical Commission of the Authority drew to the attention of the Council the fact that seven contracts ( see annex I ) for exploration for polymetallic no@@ d@@ ules would expire in 2016 and 2017 .
there are limited measures to encourage cooperation among national authorities and with the private sector .

the Constitution sets forth individual and social rights and duties , fundamental guarantees and the right to culture , education , health care and social security with a view to building an equitable society without distinction as to cre@@ ed , race , religion or political affiliation .
9 . those international conferences demonstrated that the consequences of a nuclear weapon deton@@ ation , irrespective of the cause , for humanity would include death , destruction and displacement as well as profound and long @-@ term damage to human health , the environment , climate and socioeconomic development .
although knowledge of the consequences and risks is not new -- and indeed was one of the key drivers for the negotiation and agreement of the Treaty on the Non@@ Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons -- the compelling body of evidence that has been presented to the international community since the last Review Conference in 2010 has served to heigh@@ ten awareness of the scale and extent of the consequences and thus the risks that will persist until nuclear weapons are eliminated .
the Non @-@ Proliferation Treaty review process was designed to mitigate the discriminatory nature of the Treaty that recognizes five nuclear @-@ weapon States as possessing nuclear weapons .

19 . following the agreement by the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee to hold a traditional leaders &apos; dialogue at the end of April , the meeting was postponed to the second week of May owing to the participation of the Co @-@ Chair for the Sudan in the general elections in his country , where he stood as a member of parliament in Western Kordof@@ an .

22 . the issue of verification lies at the heart of the disarmament and arms control process and in South Africa &apos;s view forms a critical element of that process .
South Africa has worked on a continuous basis , both in its national capacity and in the context of the political , regional and other groupings in which it participates , to promote the CTBT in general and also to promote its entry into force through the early signature and ratification of the Treaty , especially by those States whose ratification are required for its entry into force .
the massacres and the crimes against humanity committed by armed terrorist groups , the latest of which was the Ma@@ b &apos;@@ u@@ j@@ ah massacre , makes it imperative for , indeed , incumbent on , peace @-@ lo@@ ving States to take punitive measures against those States that support and fund the indiscriminate terrorism that has been directed against Syria and its people for more than four years .
the section also contains analyses of some of the economic challenges faced in the region , as well as a discussion of some key policy options .
